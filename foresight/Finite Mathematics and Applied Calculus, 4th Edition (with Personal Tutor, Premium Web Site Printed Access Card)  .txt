Finite Mathematics and Applied Calculus, Fourth Edition, is intended for a one- or two-
term course for students majoring in business, the social sciences, or the liberal arts. Like
the earlier editions, the Fourth Edition of Finite Mathematics and Applied Calculus is
designed to address the challenge of generating enthusiasm and mathematical sophisti-
cation in an audience that is often under-prepared and lacks motivation for traditional
mathematics courses. We meet this challenge by focusing on real-life applications that
students can relate to, by presenting mathematical concepts intuitively and thoroughly,
and by employing a writing style that is informal, engaging, and occasionally even
humorous.
The Fourth edition goes further than earlier editions in implementing support for a
wide range of instructional paradigms: from settings incorporating little or no technol-
ogy to courses taught in computerized classrooms, and from classes in which a single
form of technology is used exclusively to those incorporating several technologies. We
fully support three forms of technology in this text: TI-83/84 graphing calculators,
Excel spreadsheets, and the use of online utilities we have created for the book. In par-
ticular, our comprehensive support for Excel, both in the text and online, is highly rele-
vant for students who are studying business and economics, where skill with spread-
sheets may be vital to their future careers.
Our Approach to Pedagogy
Real World Orientation We are particularly proud of the diversity, breadth and abun-
dance of examples and exercises included in this edition. A large number of these are
based on real, referenced data from business, economics, the life sciences and the social
sciences. Examples and exercises based on dated information have generally been
replaced by more current versions; applications based on unique or historically inter-
esting data have been kept.
Adapting real data for pedagogical use can be tricky; available data can be numeri-
cally complex, intimidating for students, or incomplete. We have modified and stream-
lined many of the real world applications, rendering them as tractable as any “made-up”
application. At the same time, we have been careful to strike a pedagogically sound bal-
ance between applications based on real data and more traditional “generic” applica-
tions. Thus, the density and selection of real data-based applications has been tailored to
the pedagogical goals and appropriate difficulty level for each section.
Readability We would like students to read this book. We would like students to enjoy
reading this book. Thus, we have written the book in a conversational and student-
oriented style, and have made frequent use of question-and-answer dialogues to encour-
age the development of the student’s mathematical curiosity and intuition. We hope that
this text will give the student insight into how a mathematician develops and thinks
about mathematical ideas and their applications.
Five Elements of Mathematical Pedagogy to Address Different Learning Styles
The “Rule of Four” is a common theme in many texts. Implementing this approach, we
discuss many of the central concepts numerically, graphically and algebraically, and
clearly delineate these distinctions. The fourth element, verbal communication of math-
ematical concepts, is emphasized through our discussions on translating English
sentences into mathematical statements, and our Communication and Reasoning

exercises at the end of each section. A fifth element, interactivity, is implemented
through expanded use of question-and-answer dialogs, but is seen most dramatically
within the student website. Using this resource, students can interact with the material in
several ways: through interactive tutorials specific to concepts and examples covered in
sections, and online utilities that automate a variety of tasks, from graphing to regression
and matrix algebra.
Exercise Sets The substantial collection of exercises provides a wealth of material
that can be used to challenge students at almost every level of preparation, and includes
everything from straightforward drill exercises to interesting and rather challenging ap-
plications. The exercise sets have been carefully graded to move from straightforward
“basic skills” exercises that mimic examples in the text to more interesting and chal-
lenging ones. With this edition, basic skills exercises and the most difficult exercises are
marked for easy reference. We have also included, in virtually every section of every
chapter, interesting applications based on real data, Communication and Reasoning
exercises that help students articulate mathematical concepts, and exercises ideal for the
use of technology.
Many of the scenarios used in application examples and exercises are revisited sev-
eral times throughout the book. Thus, for instance, students will find themselves using
a variety of techniques, from graphing through the use of derivatives and elasticity, to
analyze the same application. Reusing scenarios and important functions provides uni-
fying threads and shows students the complex texture of real-life problems.
New To This Edition
Content:
• Chapter 3 (page 173): We have included a new optional section on game theory as a
modern and relevant illustration of the usefulness of matrix algebra. This gives in-
structors an alternative to input-output models as an applications topic.
• Chapter 4 (page 257): We have included an optional discussion of the use of the sim-
plex method and duality in solving games, so students who have studied game theory
in Chapter 3 can see yet another use of the simplex method.
• Chapter 7 (page 443): The sections on estimated probability (relative frequency) and
theoretical probability are now combined for greater economy and conceptual clarity.
Markov systems now appears as a single optional section at the end of the chapter
illustrating an important application of both probability and matrix algebra.
• Chapter 9 (page 615): We have placed more emphasis on half-life and doubling time
in the chapter on exponential and logarithmic functions.
• Chapter 10 (page 685): We now discuss limits and continuity in their traditional place
before derivatives, but they may still be treated as optional if so desired.
• Chapter 13 (page 919): To help students better understand the definite integral and the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have completely rewritten the chapter on the
integral with greater emphasis on the computation of Riemann sums from graphs.
• Appendix A—Logic (page A1): We have added an introductory section on logic up
through truth tables, tautologies, contradictions, and an introduction to arguments. The
material in this section is based on our highly successful and more extensive interac-
tive logic supplement and extensive companion notes that continue to be available
online for users of this edition.

Preface
xiii
• Complete sections on Taylor Polynomials, the Chain Rule
for Multivariate Calculus, and Calculus Applied to Probabil-
ity are available as optional topics for custom published ver-
sions of this text.
• Throughout, we have improved the presentation of proofs
and derivations of important results for clarity and accuracy.
Exercises:
• Basic skills exercises at the beginning of each exercise set
and challenging exercises near the end of some exercise sets
are now highlighted to guide students and instructors.
• We have expanded the exercise sets themselves and carefully
reorganized them to gradually increase in level and to
include more basic skills exercises that carefully follow the
examples.
• We have annotated representative exercises with references
to specific examples in the text where similar problems are
solved.
• We have greatly expanded the chapter review exercise
sections.
• A list of key concepts for review now appears at the end of
each chapter.
Pedagogy:
• New Portfolios are designed to convey to the student real-
world experiences of professionals who have a background
in mathematics and use it in their daily business interactions.
• End-of-Chapter Technology Guides We have placed de-
tailed TI-83/84 and Microsoft® Excel Guides at the end of
each chapter.This has allowed us to expand these instructions
while not interrupting the flow of pedagogy in the text.These
Guides are referenced liberally at appropriate points in the
chapter, so instructors and students can easily use this mate-
rial or not, as they prefer. Groups of exercises for which the
use of technology is suggested or required appear throughout
the exercise sets.
• Question and Answer Dialogue We frequently use
informal question-and-answer dialogues that anticipate the
kind of questions that may occur to the student and also
guide the student through the development of new concepts.
This feature has been streamlined, as has the “Frequently
Asked Questions” feature at the end of each section.

Working for the national ac-

division 
for 
PepsiCo
Beverages & Foods, I need to
understand applied mathematics
in order to control the variables
associated with making profit,
manufacturing, production, and
most importantly selling our
products to mass club channels.
Examples of these large, “quality product at great value” out-
lets are Wal*Mart, Costco and Target. The types of products I
handle include Gatorade, Tropicana, and Quaker foods.
Our studies show that the grocery store channels’ sales
are flattening or declining as a whole in lieu of large, national
outlets like the above. So in order to maximize growth in this
segment of our business, I meet with regional buying offices
A number of factors must be taken into consideration in
order to meet my company’s financial forecasts. Precision
usingmathematicalmodelsiskeyhere,sincesomanyvariables
can impact last-minute decision-making. Extended variables
of supply-and-demand include time of year, competitive
landscape, special coupon distribution and other promotions,
selling cycles and holidays, size of the outlets, and yes—even
the weather.
For example, it’s natural to assume that when it’s hot
outside people will buy more thirst-quenching products like
Gatorade. But since our business is so precise, we need to un-
derstand mathematically how the weather affects sales. A
mathematical model developed by Gatorade analyzes long-
term data that impacts sales by geographic market due to the
weather. Its findings include exponentially increased sales of
Gatorade for each degree above the 90 degrees. I share our

FAQs
Whether to Use Integration by Parts, and What Goes 
in the D and I Columns
Q: Will integration by parts always work to integrate a product?
A: No. While integration by parts often works for products in which one factor is a
polynomial, it will almost never work in the examples of products we saw when discussing
substitution in Section 13.2. For example, although integration by parts can be used to compute

(x2 −x)e2x−1 dx (put x2 −x in the D column and e2x−1 in the I column), it cannot be used to
compute 

(2x −1)ex2−x dx (put u = x2 −x). Recognizing when to use integration by parts is
best learned by experience. ■

Continuing Features
• Case Studies Each chapter ends with a section titled
“Case Study,” an extended application that uses and illustrates
the central ideas of the chapter, focusing on the development
of mathematical models appropriate to the topics. These appli-
cations are ideal for assignment as projects, and to this end we
have included groups of exercises at the end of each.
• Before We Go On Most examples are followed by supple-
mentary discussions, which may include a check on the answer,
a discussion of the feasibility and significance of a solution, or an in-depth look at
what the solution means.
• Quick Examples Most definition boxes include quick, straightforward examples
that a student can use to solidify each new concept.
• Communication and Reasoning Exercises for Writing and Discussion These
are exercises designed to broaden the student’s grasp of the mathematical concepts
and develop modeling skills. They include exercises in which the student is asked
to provide his or her own examples to illustrate a point or design an application with
a given solution. They also include “fill in the blank” type exercises and exercises
that invite discussion and debate. These exercises often have no single correct answer.
The Website
The authors’ website, accessible through www.thomsonedu.com/login, has been evolv-
ing for several years with growing recognition. Students, raised in an environment in
which computers suffuse both work and play, can use their web browsers to engage with
the material in an active way. The following features of the authors’ website are fully
integrated with the text and can be used as a personalized study resource: 
• Interactive Tutorials Highly interactive tutorials are included on major topics, with
guided exercises that parallel the text.
• Detailed Chapter Summaries Comprehensive summaries with interactive ele-
ments review all the basic definitions and problem solving techniques discussed in
each chapter. These are a terrific pre-test study tool for students.
• Downloadable Excel Tutorials Detailed Excel tutorials are available for almost
every section of the book. These interactive tutorials expand on the examples given in
the text.
• Online Utilities Our collection of easy-to-use online utilities, written in Java™ and
Javascript, allow students to solve many of the technology-based application exercises
directly on the web page. The utilities available include function graphers and evalua-
tors, regression tools, powerful matrix utilities and linear programming solvers, and
integration tools. These utilities require nothing more than a standard, Java-capable
web browser.
• Chapter True-False Quizzes Short quizzes based on the key concepts in each
chapter assist the student in further mastery of the material.
• Downloadable Software In addition to the web-based utilities the site offers a suite
of free and intuitive stand-alone Macintosh® programs, including one for function
graphing.

Estimating Tax Revenues
You have just been hired by the incoming administra-
tion of your country as chief consultant for national
tax policy, and you have been getting conﬂicting ad-
vice from the ﬁnance experts on your staff. Several of
them have come up with plausible suggestions for new
tax structures, and your job is to choose the plan that
results in more revenue for the government.
Before you can evaluate their plans, you realize that
it is essential to know your country’s income distribu-
tion—that is, how many people earn how much
money.37 One might think that the most useful way of specifying income distribution
would be to use a function that gives the exact number f (x) of people who earn a given
salary x. This would necessarily be a discrete function—it only makes sense if x happens
to be a whole number of cents. There is, after all, no one earning a salary of exactly
$22,000.142567! Furthermore, this function would behave rather erratically, because
there are, for example, probably many more people making a salary of exactly $30,000
than exactly $30,000.01. Given these problems, it is far more convenient to start with the

Introduction
In this chapter we review some topics from algebra that you need to know to get the most
out of this book. This chapter can be used either as a refresher course or as a reference.
There is one crucial fact you must always keep in mind: The letters used in alge-
braic expressions stand for numbers. All the rules of algebra are just facts about the
arithmetic of numbers. If you are not sure whether some algebraic manipulation you are
about to do is legitimate, try it ﬁrst with numbers. If it doesn’t work with numbers, it
doesn’t work.
Real Numbers
The real numbers are the numbers that can be written in decimal notation, including
those that require an inﬁnite decimal expansion. The set of real numbers includes all in-
tegers, positive and negative; all fractions; and the irrational numbers, those with deci-
mal expansions that never repeat. Examples of irrational numbers are
√
2 = 1.414213562373. . .
and
π = 3.141592653589. . .
It is very useful to picture the real numbers as points on a line. As shown in Figure 1,
larger numbers appear to the right, in the sense that if a < b then the point correspond-
ing to b is to the right of the one corresponding to a.
Intervals
Some subsets of the set of real numbers, called intervals, show up quite often and so we
have a compact notation for them.

Operations
There are ﬁve important operations on real numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, division, and exponentiation. “Exponentiation” means raising a real number to a
power; for instance, 32 = 3 · 3 = 9; 23 = 2 · 2 · 2 = 8.
A note on technology: Most graphing calculators and spreadsheets use an asterisk
* for multiplication and a caret sign ˆ for exponentiation. Thus, for instance, 3 × 5 is
entered as 3*5, 3x as 3*x, and 32 as 3ˆ2.
When we write an expression involving two or more operations, like
2 · 3 + 4
or
2 · 32 −5
4 −(−1)
we need to agree on the order in which to do the operations. Does 2 · 3 + 4 mean
(2 · 3) + 4 = 10 or 2 · (3 + 4) = 14? We all agree to use the following rules for the
order in which we do the operations.

Parentheses and Fraction Bars
First, calculate the values of all expressions inside parentheses or brackets, working
from the innermost parentheses out, before using them in other operations. In a fraction,
calculate the numerator and denominator separately before doing the division.

Entering Formulas
Any good calculator or spreadsheet will respect the standard order of operations. How-
ever, we must be careful with division and exponentiation and use parentheses as neces-
sary. The following table gives some examples of simple mathematical expressions and
their equivalents in the functional format used in most graphing calculators, spread-
sheets, and computer programs.

Here, it is necessary to enclose both the numerator and the
denominator in parentheses.

This is the effect of leaving out the parentheses 
around the numerator and denominator in the previous

Significant Digits, Decimal Places, and Rounding
The number of signiﬁcant digits in a decimal representation of a number is the number
of digits that are not leading zeros after the decimal point (as in .0005) or trailing zeros
before the decimal point (as in 5,400,000). We say that a value is accurate to n signiﬁ-
cant digits if only the ﬁrst n signiﬁcant digits are meaningful. 
When to Round
After doing a computation in which all the quantities are accurate to no more than n sig-
niﬁcant digits, round the ﬁnal result to n signiﬁcant digits.
1. 0.00067 has two signiﬁcant digits.
The 000 before 67 are leading zeros.
2. 0.000670 has three signiﬁcant digits.
The 0 after 67 is signiﬁcant.
3. 5,400,000 has two or more signiﬁcant digits.
We can’t say how many of the zeros are 
trailing.*
4. 5,400,001 has 7 signiﬁcant digits.
The string of zeros is not trailing.
5. Rounding 63,918 to three signiﬁcant digits gives 63,900.
6. Rounding 63,958 to three signiﬁcant digits gives 64,000.
7. π = 3.141592653...
22
7 = 3.142857142... Therefore, 22
7 is an approximation of π
that is accurate to only three signiﬁcant digits (3.14).
8. 4.02(1 + 0.02)1.4 ≈4.13
We rounded to three signiﬁcant digits.
* If we obtained 5,400,000 by rounding 5,401,011, then it has three signiﬁcant digits because the zero after
the 4 is signiﬁcant. On the other hand, if we obtained it by rounding 5,411,234, then it has only two signiﬁcant
digits. The use of scientiﬁc notation avoids this ambiguity: 5.40 × 106 (or 5.40 E6 on a calculator or computer)
is accurate to three digits and 5.4 × 106 is accurate to two.
Accuracy and Rounding
When we use a calculator or computer, the results of our calculations are often given to
far more decimal places than are useful. For example, suppose we are told that a square
has an area of 2.0 square feet and we are asked how long its sides are. Each side is the
square root of the area, which the calculator tells us is
√
2 ≈1.414213562
However, the measurement of 2.0 square feet is probably accurate to only two digits, so
our estimate of the lengths of the sides can be no more accurate than that. Therefore, we
round the answer to two digits:
Length of one side ≈1.4 feet
The digits that follow 1.4 are meaningless. The following guide makes these ideas more
precise.
One more point, though: If, in a long calculation, you round the intermediate re-
sults, your ﬁnal answer may be even less accurate than you think. As a general rule,
When calculating, don’t round intermediate results. Rather, use the most accurate re-
sults obtainable or have your calculator or computer store them for you.
When you are done with the calculation, then round your answer to the appropriate num-
ber of digits of accuracy.

If a is any real number and n is any positive integer, then by an we mean the quantity
a · a · · · · · a (n times); thus, a1 = a, a2 = a · a, a5 = a · a · a · a · a . In the expression
an the number n is called the exponent, and the number a is called the base.

numbers.

Caution
• In the ﬁrst two identities, the bases of the expres-
sions must be the same. For example, the ﬁrst gives
3234 = 36, but does not apply to 3242.
• People sometimes invent their own identities, such
as am + an = am+n, which is wrong! (Try it with
a = m = n = 1.) If you wind up with something
like 23 + 24, you are stuck with it; there are no
identities around to simplify it further. (You can
factor out 23, but whether that is a simpliﬁcation
depends on what you are going to do with the
expression next.)

Radicals
If a is any nonnegative real number, then its square root is the nonnegative number
whose square is a. For example, the square root of 16 is 4, because 42 = 16. We write
the square root of n as √n. (Roots are also referred to as radicals.) It is important to re-
member that √n is never negative. Thus, for instance, 
√
9 is 3, and not −3, even though
(−3)2 = 9. If we want to speak of the “negative square root” of 9, we write it as

9 = −3. If we want to write both square roots at once, we write ±
√
9 = ±3.
The cube root of a real number a is the number whose cube is a. The cube root of
a is written as 3√a so that, for example, 
3√
8 = 2 (because 23 = 8). Note that we can take
the cube root of any number, positive, negative, or zero. For instance, the cube root of
−8 is 
3√−8 = −2 because (−2)3 = −8. Unlike square roots, the cube root of a number
may be negative. In fact, the cube root of a always has the same sign as a.
Higher roots are deﬁned similarly. The fourth root of the nonnegative number a is
deﬁned as the nonnegative number whose fourth power is a, and written 4√a. The ﬁfth
root of any number a is the number whose ﬁfth power is a, and so on.
Note We cannot take an even-numbered root of a negative number, but we can take an
odd-numbered root of any number. Even roots are always positive, whereas odd roots
have the same sign as the number we start with. ■

Q: In the example we saw that 
	
x2 = x if x is nonnegative. What happens if x is negative ?
A: If x is negative, then x2 is positive, and so
	
x2 is still defined as the nonnegative number
whose square is x2. This number must be |x|, the absolute value of x, which is the nonnegative
number with the same size as x. For instance, |−3| = 3, while |3| = 3, and |0| = 0. It follows that
√
x2 = |x|
for every real number x, positive or negative. For instance,
	
(−3)2 =
√
9 = 3 = |−3|
and
√
32 =
√
9 = 3 = |3|
In general, we find that

xn = x if n is odd, and

xn = |x| if n is even

Rational Exponents
We already know what we mean by expressions such as x4 and a−6. The next step is to
make sense of rational exponents: exponents of the form p/q with p and q integers as
in a1/2 and 3−2/3.
Q: What should we mean by a1/2 ?
A: The overriding concern here is that all the exponent identities should remain true. In this
case the identity to look at is the one that says that (am)n = amn. This identity tells us that
(a1/2)2 = a1 = a
That is, a1/2, when squared, gives us a. But that must mean that a1/2 is the square root of a, or
a1/2 = √a
A similar argument tells us that, if q is any positive whole number, then
a1/q =
q√a
the qth root of a
Notice that if a is negative, this makes sense only for q odd. To avoid this problem, we usually
stick to positive a. ■
Q: If p and q are integers (q positive), what should we mean by a p/q ?
A: By the exponent identities, a p/q should equal both (a p)1/q and (a1/q)p. The first is the qth
root of a p, and the second is the pth power of a1/q, which gives us the following.

Converting Between Rational, Radical, 
and Exponential Form
In calculus we must often convert algebraic expressions involving powers of x, such
as 3
2x2, into expressions in which x does not appear in the denominator, such as 3
2x−2.
Also, we must often convert expressions with radicals, such as

1 + x2, into expressions
with no radicals and all powers in the numerator, such as (1 + x2)−1/2. In these cases,
we are converting from rational form or radical form to exponential form.

There is a quicker way of expanding expressions like the last two, called the “FOIL”
method (First, Outer, Inner, Last). Consider, for instance, the expression (x + 1)(x −2).
The FOIL method says: Take the product of the ﬁrst terms: x · x = x2, the product of 
the outer terms: x · (−2) = −2x, the product of the inner terms: 1 · x = x, and the
product of the last terms: 1 · (−2) = −2, and then add them all up, getting x2 −2x +
x −2 = x2 −x −2.

Factoring Algebraic Expressions
We can think of factoring as applying the distributive law in reverse—for example,
2x2 + x = x(2x + 1)
which can be checked by using the distributive law. Factoring is an art that you will learn
with experience and the help of a few useful techniques.
Factoring Using a Common Factor
To use this technique, locate a common factor—a term that occurs as a factor in each
of the expressions being added or subtracted (for example, x is a common factor in
2x2 + x, because it is a factor of both 2x2 and x). Once you have located a common
factor, “factor it out” by applying the distributive law.
1. 2x3 −x2 + x has x as a common factor, so 
2x3 −x2 + x = x(2x2 −x + 1)
2. 2x2 + 4x has 2x as a common factor, so 
2x2 + 4x = 2x(x + 2)

2x2y + xy2 −x2y2 = xy(2x + y −xy)
4. (x2 + 1)(x + 2) −(x2 + 1)(x + 3) has x2 + 1 as a common factor, so
(x2 + 1)(x + 2) −(x2 + 1)(x + 3) = (x2 + 1)[(x + 2) −(x + 3)]
= (x2 + 1)(x + 2 −x −3)

5. 12x(x2 −1)5(x3 + 1)6 + 18x2(x2 −1)6(x3 + 1)5 has 6x(x2 −1)5(x3 + 1)5 as a
common factor, so
12x(x2 −1)5(x3 + 1)6 + 18x2(x2 −1)6(x3 + 1)5
= 6x(x2 −1)5(x3 + 1)5[2(x3 + 1) + 3x(x2 −1)]
= 6x(x2 −1)5(x3 + 1)5(2x3 + 2 + 3x3 −3x)
= 6x(x2 −1)5(x3 + 1)5(5x3 −3x + 2)
We would also like to be able to reverse calculations such as (x + 2)(2x −5) =
2x2 −x −10. That is, starting with the expression 2x2 −x −10, we would like to
factor it to get the expression (x + 2)(2x −5). An expression of the form ax2 + bx + c,
where a, b, and c are real numbers, is called a quadratic expression in x. Thus,
given a quadratic expression ax2 + bx + c, we would like to write it in the form
(dx + e)( f x + g) for some real numbers d, e,  f, and g. There are some quadratics, such
as x2 + x + 1, that cannot be factored in this form at all. Here, we consider only qua-
dratics that do factor, and in such a way that the numbers d, e, f and g are integers (whole
numbers; other cases are discussed in Section 5). The usual technique of factoring such
quadratics is a “trial and error” approach.
Factoring Quadratics by Trial and Error
To factor the quadratic ax2 + bx + c, factor ax2 as (a1x)(a2x) (with a1 positive) and c
as c1c2, and then check whether ax2 + bx + c = (a1x ± c1)(a2x ± c2). If not, try other
factorizations of ax2 and c.
1. To factor x2 −6x + 5, ﬁrst factor x2 as (x)(x), and 5 as (5)(1):
(x + 5)(x + 1) = x2 + 6x + 5
No good
(x −5)(x −1) = x2 −6x + 5
Desired factorization
2. To factor x2 −4x −12, ﬁrst factor x2 as (x)(x), and −12 as (1)(−12), (2)(−6), or
(3)(−4). Trying them one-by-one gives
(x + 1)(x −12) = x2 −11x −12
No good
(x −1)(x + 12) = x2 + 11x −12
No good
(x + 2)(x −6) = x2 −4x −12
Desired factorization
3. To factor 4x2 −25, we can follow the above procedure, or recognize 4x2 −25 as the
difference of two squares:
4x2 −25 = (2x)2 −52 = (2x −5)(2x + 5)
Note: Not all quadratic expressions factor. In Section 5 we look at a test that tells us
whether or not a given quadratic factors.

Example 3 Factoring Quadratics
Factor the following: a. 4x2 −5x −6
b. x4 −5x2 + 6
Solution
a. Possible factorizations of 4x2 are (2x)(2x) or (x)(4x). Possible factorizations of −6
are (1)(−6), (2)(−3). We now systematically try out all the possibilities until we
come up with the correct one.
(2x)(2x) and (1)(−6):
(2x + 1)(2x −6) = 4x2 −10x −6
No good
(2x)(2x) and (2)(−3):
(2x + 2)(2x −3) = 4x2 −2x −6
No good
(x)(4x) and (1)(−6):
(x + 1)(4x −6) = 4x2 −2x −6
No good
(x)(4x) and (2)(−3):
(x + 2)(4x −3) = 4x2 + 5x −6
Almost!
Change signs:
(x −2)(4x + 3) = 4x2 −5x −6
Correct
b. The expression x4 −5x2 + 6 is not a quadratic, you say? Correct, it’s a quartic
(a fourth degree expression). However, it looks rather like a quadratic. In fact, it is
quadratic in x2, meaning that it is
(x2)2 −5(x2) + 6 = y2 −5y + 6
where y = x2. The quadratic y2 −5y + 6 factors as 
y2 −5y + 6 = (y −3)(y −2)
so
x4 −5x2 + 6 = (x2 −3)(x2 −2)
This is a sometimes useful technique.
Example 4 Solving a Quadratic Equation by Factoring
Solve the equation 3x2 + 4x −4 = 0.
Solution We ﬁrst factor the left-hand side to get
(3x −2)(x + 2) = 0
Thus, the product of the two quantities (3x −2) and (x + 2) is zero. Now, if a product
of two numbers is zero, one of the two must be zero. In other words, either 3x −2 = 0,
giving x = 2
3, or x + 2 = 0, giving x = −2. Thus, there are two solutions: x = 2
3 and
x = −2.
Our last example is here to remind you why we should want to factor polynomials
in the ﬁrst place. We shall return to this in Section 5.

0.5 Solving Polynomial Equations
Polynomial Equation
A polynomial equation in one unknown is an equation that can be written in the form
axn + bxn−1 + · · · + rx + s = 0
where a, b, . . . , r and s are constants.
We call the largest exponent of x appearing in a nonzero term of a polynomial the
degree of that polynomial.
1. 3x + 1 = 0 has degree 1 because the largest power of x that occurs is x = x1. Degree
1 equations are called linear equations.
2. x2 −x −1 = 0 has degree 2 because the largest power of x that occurs is x2. Degree
2 equations are also called quadratic equations, or just quadratics.
3. x3 = 2x2 + 1 is a degree 3 polynomial (or cubic) in disguise. It can be rewritten as
x3 −2x2 −1 = 0, which is in the standard form for a degree 3 equation. 
4. x4 −x = 0 has degree 4. It is called a quartic.
quick Examples
Now comes the question: How do we solve these equations for x? This question was
asked by mathematicians as early as 1600 B.C. Let’s look at these equations one degree
at a time.

Solution of Linear Equations
By deﬁnition, a linear equation can be written in the form
ax + b = 0
a and b are ﬁxed numbers with a ̸= 0.
Solving this is a nice mental exercise: Subtract b from both sides and then divide by a,
getting x = −b/a. Don’t bother memorizing this formula; just go ahead and solve linear
equations as they arise. If you feel you need practice, see the exercises at the end of the
section.
Solution of Quadratic Equations
By deﬁnition, a quadratic equation has the form
ax2 + bx + c = 0
a, b, and c are ﬁxed numbers and a ̸= 0.1
The solutions of this equation are also called the roots of ax2 + bx + c. We’re assum-
ing that you saw quadratic equations somewhere in high school but may be a little hazy
about the details of their solution. There are two ways of solving these equations—one
works sometimes, and the other works every time.

Solving Quadratic Equations by Factoring (works sometimes)
If we can factor* a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, we can solve the equation by
setting each factor equal to zero.
1. x2 + 7x + 10 = 0
(x + 5)(x + 2) = 0
Factor the left-hand side.
x + 5 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
If a product is zero, one or both factors is zero.
Solutions: x = −5 and x = −2
2. 2x2 −5x −12 = 0
(2x + 3)(x −4) = 0
Factor the left-hand side.
2x + 3 = 0 or x −4 = 0
Solutions: x = −3/2 and x = 4

Test for Factoring
The quadratic ax2 + bx + c, with a, b, and c being integers (whole numbers), factors
into an expression of the form (rx + s)(tx + u) with r, s, t and u integers precisely
when the quantity b2 −4ac is a perfect square (that is, it is the square of an integer). If
this happens, we say that the quadratic factors over the integers.
1. x2 + x + 1 has a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1, so b2 −4ac = −3, which is not a perfect
square. Therefore, this quadratic does not factor over the integers.
2. 2x2 −5x −12 has a = 2, b = −5 and c = −12, so b2 −4ac = 121. Because
121 = 112, this quadratic does factor over the integers (we factored it above).

* See the section on factoring for a review of how to factor quadratics.
1 What happens if a = 0?

Q: This is all very useful, but where does the quadratic formula come from?
A: To see where it comes from, we will solve a general quadratic equation using “brute force.”
Start with the general quadratic equation.
ax2 + bx + c = 0

a = 0
Now we complete the square: Add and subtract the quantity b2

a = 0

Solution of Cubic Equations
By deﬁnition, a cubic equation can be written in the form
ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0
a, b, c, and d are ﬁxed numbers and a ̸= 0.
Now we get into something of a bind. Although there is a perfectly respectable formula
for the solutions, it is very complicated and involves the use of complex numbers rather
heavily.2 So we discuss instead a much simpler method that sometimes works nicely.
Here is the method in a nutshell.
26
Chapter 0
Algebra Review
quick Example
* There may be irrational solutions, however; for example x3 −2 = 0 has the single solution x =
3√
2.
† Alternatively, use “synthetic division,” a shortcut that would take us too far aﬁeld to describe.
2 It was when this formula was discovered in the 16th century that complex numbers were ﬁrst taken seriously.
Although we would like to show you the formula, it is too large to ﬁt in this footnote.
Solving Cubics by Finding One Factor
Start with a given cubic equation ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0.
Step 1 By trial and error, ﬁnd one solution x = s. If a, b, c, and d are integers, the only
possible rational solutions* are those of the form s = ±(factor of d)/(factor of a).
Step 2 It will now be possible to factor the cubic as
ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = (x −s)(ax2 + ex + f ) = 0
To ﬁnd ax2 + ex + f , divide the cubic by x −s, using long division.†
Step 3 The factored equation says that either x −s = 0 or ax2 + ex + f = 0.
We already know that s is a solution, and now we see that the other solutions are
the roots of the quadratic. Note that this quadratic may or may not have any real
solutions, as usual.
To solve the cubic x3 −x2 + x −1 = 0, we ﬁrst ﬁnd a single solution. Here, a = 1 and
d = −1. Because the only factors of ±1 are ±1, the only possible rational solutions
are x = ±1. By substitution, we see that x = 1 is a solution. Thus (x −1) is a factor.
Dividing by (x −1) yields the quotient (x2 + 1). Thus,
x3 −x2 + x −1 = (x −1)(x2 + 1) = 0
so that either x −1 = 0 or x2 + 1 = 0.
Because the discriminant of the quadratic x2 + 1 is negative, we don’t get any real
solutions from x2 + 1 = 0, so the only real solution is x = 1.

Solution of Higher-Order Polynomial Equations
Logically speaking, our next step should be a discussion of quartics, then quintics (ﬁfth
degree equations), and so on forever. Well, we’ve got to stop somewhere, and cubics
may be as good a place as any. On the other hand, since we’ve gotten so far, we ought to
at least tell you what is known about higher-order polynomials.
Quartics Just as in the case of cubics, there is a formula to ﬁnd the solutions of quartics.3
0.5 Solving Polynomial Equations

Example 1 Solving a Cubic
Solve the cubic 2x3 −3x2 −17x + 30 = 0.
Solution
First we look for a single solution. Here, a = 2 and d = 30. The factors of a are ±1 and
±2, and the factors of d are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±5, ±6, ±10, ±15 and ±30.This gives us a large
number of possible ratios: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±5, ±6, ±10, ±15, ±30, ±1/2, ±3/2, ±5/2,
±15/2. Undaunted, we ﬁrst try x = 1 and x = −1, getting nowhere. So we move on to x
= 2, and we hit the jackpot, because substituting x = 2 gives 16 −12 −34 + 30 = 0.Thus,
(x −2) is a factor. Dividing yields the quotient 2x2 + x −15. Here is the calculation:
2x2 + x −15
x −2
2x3 −3x2 −17x + 30
2x3 −4x2
x2 −17x
x2 −2x
−15x + 30
−15x + 30
0
Thus,
2x3 −3x2 −17x + 30 = (x −2)(2x2 + x −15) = 0
Setting the factors equal to zero gives either x −2 = 0 or 2x2 + x −15 = 0. We could
solve the quadratic using the quadratic formula, but luckily, we notice that it factors as
2x2 + x −15 = (x + 3)(2x −5)
Thus, the solutions are x = 2, x = −3 and x = 5/2.
Possible Outcomes When Solving a Cubic Equation
If you consider all the cases, there are three possible outcomes when solving a cubic
equation:
1. One real solution (as in the Quick Example on the previous page)
2. Two real solutions (try, for example, x3 + x2 −x −1 = 0) 
3. Three real solutions (see the next example)
3 See, for example, First Course in the Theory of Equations by L. E. Dickson, (New York: Wiley, 1922), or
Modern Algebra by B. L. van der Waerden, (New York: Frederick Ungar, 1953).

Quintics and Beyond All good things must come to an end, we’re afraid. It turns out
that there is no “quintic formula.” In other words, there is no single algebraic formula or
collection of algebraic formulas that gives the solutions to all quintics. This question
was settled by the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel in 1824 after almost
300 years of controversy about this question. (In fact, several notable mathematicians
had previously claimed to have devised formulas for solving the quintic, but these were
all shot down by other mathematicians—this being one of the favorite pastimes of prac-
titioners of our art.) The same negative answer applies to polynomial equations of
degree 6 and higher. It’s not that these equations don’t have solutions, it’s just that they
can’t be found using algebraic formulas.4 However, there are certain special classes of
polynomial equations that can be solved with algebraic methods. The way of identifying
such equations was discovered around 1829 by the French mathematician Évariste
Galois.5

4 What we mean by an “algebraic formula” is a formula in the coefﬁcients using the operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division, and the taking of radicals. Mathematicians call the use of such formulas
in solving polynomial equations “solution by radicals.” If you were a math major, you would eventually go on
to study this under the heading of Galois Theory.
5 Both Abel (1802–1829) and Galois (1811–1832) died young. Abel died of tuberculosis at the age of 26, while
Galois was killed in a duel at the age of 20.

0.6 Solving Miscellaneous Equations
Equations that are not polynomial equations of low degree often arise in calculus. Many
of these complicated-looking equations can be solved easily if you remember the
following, which we used in the previous section:
quick Examples
Solving an Equation of the Form P  Q = 0
If a product is equal to 0, then at least one of the factors must be 0. That is, if P·Q = 0,
then either P = 0 or Q = 0.
1. x5 −4x3 = 0
x3(x2 −4) = 0
Factor the left-hand side.
Either x3 = 0 or x2 −4 = 0
Either P = 0 or Q = 0.
x = 0, 2 or −2
Solve the individual equations.
2. (x2 −1)(x + 2) + (x2 −1)(x + 4) = 0
(x2 −1)[(x + 2) + (x + 4)] = 0
Factor the left-hand side.
(x2 −1)(2x + 6) = 0
Either x2 −1 = 0 or 2x + 6 = 0
Either P = 0 or Q = 0.
x = −3, −1, or 1
Solve the individual equations.
Example 1 Solving by Factoring
Solve 12x(x2 −4)5(x2 + 2)6 + 12x(x2 −4)6(x2 + 2)5 = 0.
Solution
Again, we start by factoring the left-hand side:
12x(x2 −4)5(x2 + 2)6 + 12x(x2 −4)6(x2 + 2)5
= 12x(x2 −4)5(x2 + 2)5[(x2 + 2) + (x2 −4)]
= 12x(x2 −4)5(x2 + 2)5(2x2 −2)
= 24x(x2 −4)5(x2 + 2)5(x2 −1)
Setting this equal to 0, we get:
24x(x2 −4)5(x2 + 2)5(x2 −1) = 0
which means that at least one of the factors of this product must be zero. Now it cer-
tainly cannot be the 24, but it could be the x: x = 0 is one solution. It could also be that
(x2 −4)5 = 0
or
x2 −4 = 0
which has solutions x = ±2. Could it be that (x2 + 2)5 = 0? If so, then x2 + 2 = 0, but
this is impossible because x2 + 2 ≥2, no matter what x is. Finally, it could be that
x2 −1 = 0, which has solutions x = ±1. This gives us ﬁve solutions to the original
equation:
x = −2, −1, 0, 1, or 2

Example 2 Solving by Factoring
Solve (x2 −1)(x2 −4) = 10.
Solution Watch out! You may be tempted to say that x2 −1 = 10 or x2 −4 = 10, but
this does not follow. If two numbers multiply to give you 10, what must they be? There
are lots of possibilities: 2 and 5, 1 and 10, −500,000 and −0.00002 are just a few. The
fact that the left-hand side is factored is nearly useless to us if we want to solve this
equation. What we will have to do is multiply out, bring the 10 over to the left, and hope
that we can factor what we get. Here goes:
x4 −5x2 + 4 = 10
x4 −5x2 −6 = 0
(x2 −6)(x2 + 1) = 0
(Here we used a sometimes useful trick that we mentioned in Section 3: we treated x2
like x and x4 like x2, so factoring x4 −5x2 −6 is essentially the same as factoring x2 −
5x −6.) Now we are allowed to say that one of the factors must be 0: x2 −6 = 0 has
solutions x = ±
√
6 = ±2.449 . . . and x2 + 1 = 0 has no real solutions. Therefore, we
get exactly two solutions, x = ±
√
6 = ±2.449 . . . .
To solve equations involving rational expressions, the following rule is very useful.
quick Example
Solving an Equation of the Form P/Q = 0
If P
Q = 0, then P = 0.
How else could a fraction equal 0? If that is not convincing, multiply both sides by Q
(which cannot be 0 if the quotient is deﬁned).
(x + 1)(x + 2)2 −(x + 1)2(x + 2)
(x + 2)4
= 0
(x + 1)(x + 2)2 −(x + 1)2(x + 2) = 0
If P
Q = 0, then P = 0.
(x + 1)(x + 2)[(x + 2) −(x + 1)] = 0
Factor.
(x + 1)(x + 2)(1) = 0
Either x + 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
x = −1 or x = −2
x = −1
x = −2 does not make sense in the original
equation: it makes the denominator 0. So it is not
a solution and x = −1 is the only solution.
Example 3 Solving a Rational Equation
Solve 1 −1
x2 = 0.
Solution Write 1 as 1
1, so that we now have a difference of two rational expressions:
1
1 −1
x2 = 0

0.6 Solving Miscellaneous Equations

To combine these we can put both over a common denominator of x2, which gives
x2 −1
x2
= 0
Now we can set the numerator, x2 −1, equal to zero. Thus,
x2 −1 = 0
so
(x −1)(x + 1) = 0
giving x = ±1.
+Before we go on . . . This equation could also have been solved by writing
1 = 1
x2
and then multiplying both sides by x2. ■
Example 4 Another Rational Equation
Solve 2x −1
x
+
3
x −2 = 0.
Solution
We could ﬁrst perform the addition on the left and then set the top equal to 0, but here is
another approach. Subtracting the second expression from both sides gives
2x −1
x
=
−3
x −2
Cross-multiplying [multiplying both sides by both denominators—that is, by x(x −2)]
now gives
(2x −1)(x −2) = −3x
so
2x2 −5x + 2 = −3x
Adding 3x to both sides gives the quadratic equation
2x2 −2x + 1 = 0
The discriminant is (−2)2 −4 · 2 · 1 = −4 < 0, so we conclude that there is no real
solution.
+Before we go on. . . Notice that when we said that (2x −1)(x −2) = −3x, we were not
allowed to conclude that 2x −1 = −3x or x −2 = −3x. ■

This still involves fractions. To get rid of the fractions, we could put everything over a
common denominator (√x + 1) and then set the top equal to 0, or we could multiply the
whole equation by that common denominator in the ﬁrst place to clear fractions. If we
do the second, we get
2x(x + 1) −x2 = 0
2x2 + 2x −x2 = 0
x2 + 2x = 0
Factoring,
x(x + 2) = 0
so either x = 0 or x + 2 = 0, giving us x = 0 or x = −2. Again, one of these is not really
a solution. The problem is that x = −2 cannot be substituted into √x + 1, because we
would then have to take the square root of −1, and we are not allowing ourselves to do
that. Therefore, x = 0 is the only solution.

Chapter 1
Functions and Linear Models
Introduction
To analyze recent trends in spending on Internet advertising and to make reasonable
projections, we need a mathematical model of this spending. Where do we start? To
apply mathematics to real-world situations like this, we need a good understanding of
basic mathematical concepts. Perhaps the most fundamental of these concepts is that of
a function: a relationship that shows how one quantity depends on another. Functions
may be described numerically and, often, algebraically. They can also be described
graphically—a viewpoint that is extremely useful.
The simplest functions—the ones with the simplest formulas and the simplest
graphs—are linear functions. Because of their simplicity, they are also among the most
useful functions and can often be used to model real-world situations, at least over short
periods of time. In discussing linear functions, we will meet the concepts of slope and
rate of change, which are the starting point of the mathematics of change.
In the last section of this chapter, we discuss simple linear regression: construction
of linear functions that best ﬁt given collections of data. Regression is used extensively
in applied mathematics, statistics, and quantitative methods in business. The inclusion
of regression utilities in computer spreadsheets like Excel® makes this powerful mathe-
matical tool readily available for anyone to use.

The following table gives the weights of a particular child at various ages in her ﬁrst

Let’s write W(0) for the child’s weight at birth (in pounds), W(2) for her weight at 2 months,
and so on (we read W(0) as “W of 0”). Thus, W(0) = 8, W(2) = 9, W(3) = 13, . . . ,
W(12) = 19. More generally, if we write t for the age of the child (in months) at any time
during her ﬁrst year, then we write W(t) for the weight of the child at age t. We call W a
function of the variable t, meaning that for each value of t between 0 and 12, W gives us
a single corresponding number W(t) (the weight of the child at that age).
In general, we think of a function as a way of producing new objects from old ones.
The functions we deal with in this text produce new numbers from old numbers. The
numbers we have in mind are the real numbers, including not only positive and negative
integers and fractions but also numbers like 
√
2 or π (see Chapter 0 for more on real
numbers). For this reason, the functions we use are called real-valued functions of a
real variable. For example, the function W takes the child’s age in months and returns
her weight in pounds at that age (Figure 1).
Figure 1
Weight
W(t)
Age
t
W

The variable t is called the independent variable, while W is called the dependent
variable as its value depends on t.
A function may be speciﬁed in several different ways. It may be speciﬁed numeri-
cally, by giving the values of the function for a number of values of the independent
variable, as in the preceding table. It may be speciﬁed verbally, as in “Let W(t) be the
weight of the child at age t months in her ﬁrst year.”1 In some cases we may be able to
use an algebraic formula to calculate the function, and we say that the function is spec-
iﬁed algebraically. In Section 1.2 we will see that a function may also be speciﬁed
graphically.
Q: For which values of t does it make sense to ask for W(t)? In other words, for which ages t is
the function W defined?
A: Since W(t) refers to the weight of the child at age t months in her first year, W(t) is defined
when t is any number between 0 and 12, that is, when 0 ≤t ≤12. Using interval notation (see
Appendix A), we can say that W(t) is defined when t is in the interval [0, 12]. ■
The set of values of the independent variable for which a function is deﬁned is
called its domain and is a necessary part of the deﬁnition of the function. Notice that the
preceding table gives the values of W(t) at only some of the inﬁnitely many possible
values in the domain [0, 12].
The domain of a function is not always speciﬁed explicitly; if no domain is 
speciﬁed for a function f, we take the domain to be the largest set of numbers x for which
f (x) makes sense. This “largest possible domain” is sometimes called the natural
domain.
Here is a summary of the terms we’ve just introduced.
1.1 Functions from the Numerical and Algebraic Viewpoints
35
quick Examples
Functions
A real-valued function f of a real-valued variable x assigns to each real number x in
a speciﬁed set of numbers, called the domain of f, a unique real number f (x), read 
“f of x.” The variable x is called the independent variable, and f is called the depen-
dent variable.
1. Let W(t) be the weight (in pounds) at age t months of a particular child during her
ﬁrst year. The independent variable is t, and the dependent variable is W, the child’s
weight. The domain of W is [0, 12] because it was speciﬁed that W gives the child’s
weight during her ﬁrst year.
2. Let f (x) = 1
x . The function f is speciﬁed algebraically. Some speciﬁc values of f are
f (2) = 1
2
f (3) = 1
3
f (−1) = 1
−1 = −1
Here, f (0) is not deﬁned because there is no such number as 1/0. The natural domain
of f consists of all real numbers except zero because f (x) makes sense for all values
of x other than x = 0.
1 Specifying a function verbally in this way is useful for understanding what the function is doing, but it gives
no numerical information.

Viewing P as a function of x, give its domain and the values P(0), P(2), and P(4). Com-
pute P(3) −P(2) and interpret the result. Also estimate and interpret the value P(3.5).
Solution The domain of P is the set of numbers x with 0 ≤x ≤4—that is, [0, 4].
From the table, we have:
P(0) = 12
$12 billion net income in 2000
P(2) = −34
$34 billion cumulative loss from Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2002
P(4) = −61
$61 billion cumulative loss from Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2004
Also,
P(3) −P(2) = −51 −(−34) = −17
To interpret the result, notice that:
Cumulative net income through 2003  Cumulative net income through 2002
 Net income in 2003
Thus, the net income in 2003 was $17 billion. In other words, $17 billion was lost by
the airline industry in 2003.
What about P(3.5)? Since P(3) = −51 and P(4) = −61, we estimate that
P(3.5) ≈−56
56 is midway between 51 and 61.
The process of estimating values for a function between points where it is already
known is called interpolation.
To interpret P(3.5), note that P(3) represents the accumulated net income through
2003, and P(4) represents the accumulated net income through 2004. Thus, P(3.5) rep-
resents the accumulated net income through June, 2003.

+Before we go on... In Example 1 we should not use the table to estimate P(x) for val-
ues of x outside the domain—say, for x = 10. Estimating values for a function outside a
range where it is already known is called extrapolation. As a general rule, extrapolation
is far less reliable than interpolation: predicting the future from current data is difﬁcult,
especially given the vagaries of the marketplace. ■
The two functions we have looked at so far were both speciﬁed numerically: we
were given numerical values of the function evaluated at certain values of the inde-
pendent variable. It would be more useful if we had a formula that would allow us to

calculate the value of the function for any value of the independent variable we wished,
that is, if the function were speciﬁed algebraically.
1.1 Functions from the Numerical and Algebraic Viewpoints

Note that there is nothing magical about the letter x. We might just as well say
f (t) = t2 −25t + 15
which deﬁnes exactly the same function as f (x) = x2 −25x + 15. For example, to
calculate f (10) from the formula for f (t) we would substitute 10 for t, getting
f (10) = −135, just as we did using the formula for f (x).
+Before we go on... We said that the function f given in the Example 2 is an approxima-

Example 2 An Algebraically Defined Function
Let f be the function speciﬁed by 
f (x) = x2 −25x + 15
with domain (−2, 10]. When 0 ≤x ≤4, this formula gives an approximation of the
airline cumulative net income function P in Example 1. Use the formula to calculate
f (0), f (10), f (−1), f (a), and f (x + h). Is f (−2) deﬁned?
Solution Let’s check ﬁrst that the values we are asked to calculate are all deﬁned.
Since the domain is stated to be (−2, 10], the quantities f (0), f (10), and f (−1) are all
deﬁned. The quantities f (a) and f (x + h) will also be deﬁned if a and x + h are un-
derstood to be in (−2, 10]. However, f (−2) is not deﬁned, since −2 is not in the domain
(−2, 10].
If we substitute 0 for x in the formula for f (x), we get
f (0) = (0)2 −25(0) + 15 = 15
so f (0) = 15. Similarly,
f (10) = (10)2 −25(10) + 15 = 100 −250 + 15 = −135
f (−1) = (−1)2 −25(−1) + 15 = 1 + 25 + 15 = 41
f (a) = a2 −25a + 15
Substitute a for x.
f (x + h) = (x + h)2 −25(x + h) + 15
Substitute (x + h) for x.
= x2 + 2xh + h2 −25x −25h + 15
Note how we placed parentheses around the number at which we are evaluating the
function. If we omitted any of these parentheses, we would likely get errors:
f (−1) = (−1)2 −25(−1) + 15 
NOT −12 −25(−1) + 15

f (x + h) = (x + h)2 −25(x + h) + 15 
NOT x + h2 −25(x + h) + 15

2 The function f is a “best-ﬁt,” or regression quadratic curve based on the data in Example 1 (coefﬁcients are
rounded). We will learn more about regression later in this chapter.

Chapter 1
Functions and Linear Models
We call the algebraic function f an algebraic model of U.S. airlines’ cumulative net in-
come from Jan. 2000 because it uses an algebraic formula to model—or mathematically
represent (approximately)—the cumulative net income. The particular kind of algebraic
model we used is called a quadratic model (see the end of this section for the names of
some commonly used models). ■
Q: The values of f(x) are close to but don’t all equal those of P(x). Is this the best we can do with
an algebraic model? Can’t we get a formula that gives the cumulative net income data exactly?
A: It is possible to find algebraic formulas that give the exact values of P(x), but such formu-
las would be far more complicated than the one given, and quite possibly less useful.3 ■
Note Equation and Function Notation
Instead of using function notation
f (x) = x2 −25x + 15
Function notation
we could use equation notation
y = x2 −25x + 15
Equation notation
(the choice of the letter y is a convention) and we say that “y is a function of x.”  When
we write a function in this form, the variable x is the independent variable and y is the
dependent variable. 
We could also write the above function as f = x2 −25x + 15, in which case the
dependent variable would be f.
using Technology
Evaluating a function can be
tedious to do by hand, but
various technologies make this
task easier. See the Technology
Guides at the end of the chapter
to ﬁnd out how to create a table
like the one in Example 3,
using a TI-83/84 or Excel.

3 One reason that more complex formulas are often less realistic than simple ones is that it is often random
phenomena in the real world, rather than algebraic relationships, that cause data to ﬂuctuate. Attempting to
model these random ﬂuctuations using algebraic formulas amounts to imposing mathematical structure where
structure does not exist.
Example 3 Evaluating a Function with Technology
Evaluate the function f (x) = −0.4x2 + 7x −23 for x = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 10.
Solution
The ﬁrst couple of evaluations go as follows:
f (0) = −0.4(0)2 + 7(0) −23 = −23
f (1) = −0.4(1)2 + 7(1) −23 = −0.4 + 7 −23 = −16.4
Note that to evaluate −0.4x2, we ﬁrst compute x2 and then multiply by −0.4. Continu-
ing, we get the following table.
Sometimes, as in Example 4, we need to use several formulas to specify a single
function.

The functions we used in Examples 1–4 above are mathematical models of real-
life situations, because they model, or represent, situations in mathematical terms.

Example 4 A Piecewise-Defined Function: EBAY Stock
The price V(t) in dollars of EBAY stock during the 10-week period starting July 1, 2004
can be approximated by the following function of time t in weeks (t = 0 represents
July 1):*
V(t) =

90 −4t
if 0 ≤t ≤5
60 + 2t
if 5 < t ≤20
What was the approximate price of EBAY stock after 1 week, after 5 weeks, and after
10 weeks? 
Solution
We evaluate the given function at the corresponding value of t:
t = 1:
V(1) = 90 −4(1) = 86
We use the ﬁrst formula since 0 ≤t ≤5.
t = 5:
V(5) = 90 −4(5) = 70
We use the ﬁrst formula since 0 ≤t ≤5.
t = 10:
V(10) = 60 + 2(10) = 80
We use the second formula since 5 < t ≤20.
Thus, the price of EBAY stock was $86 after 1 week, $70 after 5 weeks, and $80 after
10 weeks.

Mathematical Modeling 
To mathematically model a situation means to represent it in mathematical terms. The
particular representation used is called a mathematical model of the situation. Mathe-
matical models do not always represent a situation perfectly or completely. Some (like
Example 2) represent a situation only approximately, whereas others represent only
some aspects of the situation.

1. Albano’s bank balance is twice
a = 2b
Bravo’s.
(a  Albano’s balance, b  Bravo’s)
2. The temperature  is now 10°F and 
T(t) = 10 + 20t
increasing by 20° per hour.
(t  time in hours, T  temperature)
3. The volume of a rectangular solid 
V = x2h
with square base is obtained by 
(h  height, x  length of a side of the base)
multiplying the area of its base by 
its height.

1.2 Functions from the Graphical Viewpoint
Consider again the function W discussed in Section 1.1, giving a child’s weight during
her ﬁrst year. If we represent the data given in Section 1.1 graphically by plotting the
given pairs of numbers (t, W(t)), we get Figure 2. (We have connected successive points
by line segments.)

Figure 2
Suppose now that we had only the graph without the table of data given in Section 1.1.
We could use the graph to ﬁnd values of W. For instance, to ﬁnd W(9) from the graph we
do the following:
1. Find the desired value of t at the bottom of the graph (t = 9 in this case).
2. Estimate the height (W-coordinate) of the corresponding point on the graph (18 in
this case). 
Thus, W(9) ≈18 pounds.15
We say that Figure 2 speciﬁes the function W graphically. The graph is not a very
accurate speciﬁcation of W; the actual weight of the child would follow a smooth curve
15 In a graphically deﬁned function, we can never know the y-coordinates of points exactly; no matter how
accurately a graph is drawn, we can only obtain approximate values of the coordinates of points. That is why
we have been using the word estimate rather than calculate and why we say “W(9) ≈18” rather than
“W(9) = 18.”

Sometimes we are interested in drawing the graph of a function that has been speciﬁed
in some other way—perhaps numerically or algebraically. We do this by plotting points
with coordinates (x, f (x)).16 Here is the formal deﬁnition of a graph.

rather than a jagged line. However, the jagged line is useful in that it permits us to inter-
polate: for instance, we can estimate that W(1) ≈8.5 pounds.
Example 1 A Function Specified Graphically: iPod Sales
Figure 3 shows the approximate quarterly sales of iPods for the second quarter in 2003
through the third quarter in 2004 (t = 0 represents the second quarter of 2003).*
Estimate and interpret S(1), S(4), and S(5). What is the domain of S?
Solution We carefully estimate the S-coordinates of the points with t-coordinates 1, 4,
and 5.
S(1) ≈300
meaning that iPod sales in the third quarter of 2003 (t = 1) were approximately 300,000
units.
S(4) ≈900
meaning that iPod sales in the second quarter of 2004 (t = 4) were approximately
900,000 units.
S(5) ≈1050
meaning that iPod sales in the third quarter of 2004 (t = 5) were approximately
1,050,000 units.
The domain of S is the set of all values of t for which S(t) is deﬁned: 0 ≤t ≤5,
or [0, 5].

16 Graphing utilities typically draw graphs by plotting and connecting a large number of points.
quick Example
Graph of a Function
The graph of the function f is the set of all points (x, f (x)) in the xy plane, where we
restrict the values of x to lie in the domain of f.
To sketch the graph of the function
f (x) = x2
Function notation
or 
y = x2
Equation notation
with domain the set of all real numbers, ﬁrst choose some convenient values of x in the
domain and compute the corresponding y-coordinates.
Bartomeu Amengual/Index Stock Imagery

To draw the graph of a function, we often do as we did in the Quick Example above:
We plot points of the form (x, f (x)) for several values of x in the domain of f, until we
can get a good idea of the shape of the entire graph. (Calculus can give us information
that allows us to draw a graph with relatively few points plotted.)
46
Chapter 1
Functions and Linear Models
Plotting these points gives the picture on the left, suggesting the graph on the right.*
(This particular curve happens to be called a parabola, and its lowest point, at the
origin, is called its vertex.)
* If you plot more points, you will ﬁnd that they lie on a smooth curve as shown. That is why we did not use
line segments to connect the points.

Example 2 Drawing the Graph of a Function: Web-Site Revenue
The monthly revenue† R from users logging on to your gaming site depends on the
monthly access fee p you charge according to the formula
R( p) = −5600p2 + 14,000p
(0 ≤p ≤2.5)
(R and p are in dollars.) Sketch the graph of R. Find the access fee that will result in the
largest monthly revenue.
† The revenue resulting from one or more business transactions is the total payment received, sometimes
called the gross proceeds.

The revenue graph appears to reach its highest point when p = 1.25, so setting the ac-
cess fee at $1.25 appears to result in the largest monthly revenue.*
* We are hedging our language with words like suggesting and appears because the few points we have plot-
ted don’t, by themselves, allow us to draw these conclusions with certainty.
1.2 Functions from the Graphical Viewpoint

Solution To sketch the graph of R by hand, we plot points of the form ( p, R( p)) for
several values of p in the domain [0, 2.5] of R. First, we calculate several points:

Note Switching Between Equation and Function Notation
As we discussed after Example 2 in Section 1.1, we can write the function R in Exam-
ple 2 above in equation notation as
R = −5600p2 + 14,000p
Equation notation
The independent variable is p, and the dependent variable is R. Function notation and
equation notation, using the same letter for the function name and the dependent vari-
able, are often used interchangeably. It is important to be able to switch back and forth
easily from function notation to equation notation.
Vertical Line Test
Every point in the graph of a function has the form (x, f (x)) for some x in the domain
of f. Since f assigns a single value f (x) to each value of x in the domain, it follows that,
in the graph of f, there should be only one y corresponding to any such value of x—
namely, y = f (x). In other words, the graph of a function cannot contain two or more
points with the same x-coordinate—that is, two or more points on the same vertical line.

function. The Technology
Guides for Example 2 of this
section show how to then draw

Example 3 Graphing a Piecewise-Defined Function: EBAY Stock
The price V(t) in dollars of EBAY stock during the 10-week period starting July 1, 2004
can be approximated by the following function of time t in weeks (t = 0 represents
July 1):*
V(t) =

90 −4t
if 0 ≤t ≤5
60 + 2t
if 5 < t ≤20
Graph the function V.
Solution As in Example 2, we can sketch the graph of V by hand by computing V(t)
for a number of values of t, plotting these points on the graph, and then connecting them.
On the other hand, a vertical line at a value of x not in the domain will not contain any
points in the graph. This gives us the following rule:

The graph (Figure 5) has the following features:
1. The ﬁrst formula (the descending line) is used for 0 ≤t ≤5.
2. The second formula (the ascending line) is used for 5 < t ≤20.
3. The domain is [0, 20], so the graph is cut off at t = 0 and t = 20.
4. The heavy dots at the ends indicate the endpoints of the domain.

Functions
Graph the function f speciﬁed by
f (x) =
 −1
if −4 ≤x < −1
x
if −1 ≤x ≤1
x2 −1
if 1 < x ≤2
Solution The domain of f is [−4, 2], since f (x) is only speciﬁed when −4 ≤x ≤2.
Further, the function changes formulas when x = −1 and x = 1.
To sketch the graph by hand, we ﬁrst sketch the three
graphs y = −1, y = x, and y = x2 −1, and then use the
appropriate portion of each (Figure 6).
Note that solid dots indicate points on the graph,
whereas the open dots indicate points not on the graph.
For example, when x = 1, the inequalities in the formula
tell us that we are to use the middle formula (x) rather
than the bottom one (x2 −1). Thus, f (1) = 1, not 0, so
we place a solid dot at (1, 1) and an open dot at (1, 0).

Linear Functions
Linear functions are among the simplest functions and are perhaps the most useful of all
mathematical functions.
quick Example
Linear Function
A linear function is one that can be written in the form
f (x) = mx + b
Function form
f (x) = 3x −1
or
y = mx + b
Equation form
y = 3x −1
where m and b are ﬁxed numbers (the names m and b
are traditional*).
* Actually, c is sometimes used instead of b. As for m, there has even
been some research lately into the question of its origin, but no one
knows exactly why the letter m is used.

Linear Functions from the Numerical 
and Graphical Point of View
The following table shows values of y = 3x −1 (m = 3, b = −1) for some values of x:

Its graph is shown in Figure 7.
Looking ﬁrst at the table, notice that that setting x = 0 gives y = −1, the value of b.
Numerically, b is the value of y when x = 0
On the graph, the corresponding point (0, −1) is the point where the graph crosses the
y-axis, and we say that b = −1 is the y-intercept of the graph (Figure 8).
What about m? Looking once again at the table, notice that y increases by
m = 3 units for every increase of 1 unit in x. This is caused by the term 3x in the for-
mula: for every increase of 1 in x we get an increase of 3 × 1 = 3 in y.
Numerically, y increases by m units for every 1-unit increase of x
Likewise, for every increase of 2 in x we get an increase of 3 × 2 = 6 in y. In general, if
x increases by some amount, y will increase by three times that amount. We write:
Change in y = 3 × Change in x

The Change in a Quantity: Delta Notation
If a quantity q changes from q1 to q2, the change in q is just the difference:
Change in q = Second value −First value
= q2 −q1
Mathematicians traditionally use  (delta, the Greek equivalent of the Roman letter D)
to stand for change, and write the change in q as q.
q = Change in q = q2 −q1
1. If x is changed from 1 to 3, we write
x = Second value −First value = 3 −1 = 2
2. Looking at our linear function, we see that when x changes from 1 to 3, y changes
from 2 to 8. So,
y = Second value −First value = 8 −2 = 6
Using delta notation, we can now write, for our linear function,
y = 3x
Change in y  3  Change in x
or
y
x = 3
Because the value of y increases by exactly 3 units for every increase of 1 unit in x, the
graph is a straight line rising by 3 units for every 1 unit we go to the right. We say that

we have a rise of 3 units for each run of 1 unit. Because the value of y changes
by y = 3x units for every change of x units in x, in general we have a rise of
y = 3x units for each run of x units (Figure 9). Thus, we have a rise of 6 for a run
of 2, a rise of 9 for a run of 3, and so on. So, m = 3 is a measure of the steepness of the
line; we call m the slope of the line:
Slope = m = y
x = Rise

Graphically, m is the slope of the graph.
In general (replace the number 3 by a general number m), we can say the following.
The Roles of m and b in the Linear Function f(x)  mx  b
Role of m
Numerically If y = mx + b, then y changes by m units for every 1-unit change in x. A
change of x units in x results in a change of y = mx units in y. Thus,
m = y
x = Change in y
Change in x
Graphically m is the slope of the line y = mx + b:
m = y
x = Rise
Run = Slope
For positive m, the graph rises m units for every 1-unit move to the right, and rises
y = mx units for every x units moved to the right. For negative m, the graph drops
|m| units for every 1-unit move to the right, and drops |m|x units for every x units
moved to the right.

the table is x = 2 each time, the change in f is not the same each time. Thus, the ratio
f/x is not the same for every successive pair of points.

Thus, g is linear with slope m = −2. By the table, g(0) = 3, hence b = 3. Thus,

If you graph the points in the tables deﬁning f and g above, it becomes easy to see that
g is linear and f is not; the points of g lie on a straight line (with slope −2), whereas the
points of f do not lie on a straight line (Figure 11).

Example 2 Graphing a Linear Equation by Hand: Intercepts
Graph the equation x + 2y = 4. Where does the line cross the x- and y-axes?
Solution We ﬁrst write y as a linear function of x by solving the equation for y.
2y = −x + 4
so
y = −1
2x + 2
using Technology
Consult the Technology Guides
at the end of the chapter to see
how to generate tables showing
the ratios f/x and g/x.
These tables show at a glance
that f is not linear.

Now we can see that the graph is a straight line with a slope of −1/2 and a y-intercept
of 2. We start at 2 on the y-axis and go down 1/2 unit for every 1 unit we go to the right.
The graph is shown in Figure 12.
We already know that the line crosses the y-axis at 2. Where does it cross the x-axis?
Wherever that is, we know that the y-coordinate will be 0 at that point. So, we set y = 0
and solve for x. It’s most convenient to use the equation we were originally given:
x + 2(0) = 4
Original equation with x = 0
so
x = 4
The line crosses the x-axis at 4.
Before we go on... We could have graphed the equation in Example 2 another way,
by ﬁrst ﬁnding the intercepts. Once we know that the line crosses the y-axis at 2 and the
x-axis at 4, we can draw those two points and then draw the line connecting them. ■
We now summarize the procedure for ﬁnding the intercepts of a line.

Finding the Intercepts
The x-intercept of a line is where it crosses the x-axis. To ﬁnd it, set y = 0 and solve for
x. The y-intercept is where it crosses the y-axis. If the equation of the line is written in
as y = mx + b, then b is the y-intercept. Otherwise, set x = 0 and solve for y.
Consider the equation 3x −2y = 6. To ﬁnd its x-intercept, set y = 0 to ﬁnd
x = 6/3 = 2. To ﬁnd its y-intercept, set x = 0 to ﬁnd y = 6/(−2) = −3. The line
crosses the x-axis at 2 and the y-axis at −3.
Computing the Slope of a Line
We know that the slope of a line is given by
Slope = m = Rise
Run = y
x
Recall that two points—say (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)—determine a line in the xy-plane. To
ﬁnd its slope, we need a run x and corresponding rise y. In Figure 13, we see that we
can use x = x2 −x1, the change in the x-coordinate from the ﬁrst point to the second,
as our run, and y = y2 −y1, the change in the y-coordinate, as our rise. The resulting
formula for computing the slope is given below.

Q: What if we had chosen to list the two points in Quick Example 1 in reverse order? That is,
suppose we had taken (x1, y1) = (5, 11) and (x2, y2) = (1, 3). What would have been the effect
on the computation of the slope?
A: We would have found
m = y
x = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
= 3 −11
1 −5 = −8
−4 = 2
the same answer. The order in which we take the points is not important, as long as we use the
same order in the numerator and the denominator. ■
Example 3 Special Slopes
Find the slope of the line through (2, 3) and (−1, 3) and the slope of the line through
(3, 2) and (3, −1).
Solution The line through (2, 3) and (−1, 3) has slope
m = y
x = 3 −3
−1 −2 = 0
−3 = 0
A line of slope 0 has 0 rise, so is a horizontal line, as shown in Figure 14. The line
through (3, 2) and (3, −1) has slope
m = y
x = −1 −2
3 −3 = −3

which is undeﬁned. If we plot the two points, we see that the line passing through them
is vertical, as shown in Figure 15.

Computing the Slope of a Line
We can compute the slope m of the line through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using
m = y
x = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
1. The slope of the line through (x1, y1) = (1, 3) and (x2, y2) = (5, 11) is
m = y
x = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
= 11 −3
5 −1 = 8
4 = 2
2. The slope of the line through (x1, y1) = (1, 2) and (x2, y2) = (2, 1) is
m = y
x = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
= 1 −2
2 −1 = −1
1 = −1
Vertical lines have undeﬁned slope.

then the equation is y = 3x −1. Sadly, the information we are given is seldom so
convenient. For instance, we may know the slope and a point other than the y-intercept,
two points on the line, or other information.
We describe a straightforward method for ﬁnding the equation of a line: the point-
slope method. As the name suggests, we need two pieces of information:
• The slope m (which speciﬁes the direction of the line)
• A point (x1, y1) on the line (which pins down its location in the plane)
The equation of the line through the point (x1, y1) with slope m must have the form
y = mx + b
for some (unknown) number b. To determine b we use the fact that the line must pass
through the point (x1, y1), so that (x1, y1) satisﬁes the equation y = mx + b. In other
words,
y1 = mx1 + b
Solving for b gives
b = y1 −mx1

The Point-Slope Formula
An equation of the line through the point (x1, y1) with slope m is given by
y = mx + b
Equation form
where
b = y1 −mx1
The line through (2, 3) with slope 4 has equation
y = 4x + b, where b = 3 −(4)(2) = −5, so y = 4x −5
Q: When do we use the point-slope formula rather than the slope-intercept form ?
A: Use the point-slope formula to find the equation of a line when you are given information
about a point and the slope of the line. The formula does not apply if the slope is undefined, as
in a vertical line; see Example 4(d) below. The slope-intercept form is more useful for graphing
a line whose equation you already have. ■
Example 4 Using the Point-Slope Formula
Find equations for the following straight lines.
a. Through the points (1, 2) and (3, −1)
b. Through (2, −2) and parallel to the line 3x + 4y = 5
c. Horizontal and through (−9, 5)
d. Vertical and through (−9, 5)

Solution In each case other than (d), we apply the point-slope formula.
a. To apply the point-slope formula, we need
• Point We have two to choose from, so we take the ﬁrst, (x1, y1) = (1, 2).
• Slope Not given directly, but we do have enough information to calculate it. Since
we are given two points on the line, we can use the slope formula:
m = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
= −1 −2
3 −1 = −3

An equation of the line is therefore

b. Proceeding as before,
• Point Given here as (2, −2).
• Slope We use the fact that parallel lines have the same slope. (Why?) We can
ﬁnd the slope of 3x + 4y = 5 by solving for y and then looking at the coefﬁcient
of x:
y = −3
4x + 5

To ﬁnd the slope, solve for y.
so the slope is −3/4.

c. We are given a point: (−9, 5). Furthermore, we are told that the line is horizontal,
which tells us that the slope is 0. Therefore, we get
y = 0x + b = b
where b = y1 −mx1 = 5 −(0)(−9) = 5

d. We are given a point: (−9, 5). This time, we are told that the line is vertical, which
means that the slope is undeﬁned. Thus, we can’t use the point-slope formula. (That
formula makes sense only when the slope of the line is deﬁned.) What can we do?
Well, here are some points on the desired line:
(−9, 1), (−9, 2), (−9, 3), . . . ,
so x = −9 and y = anything. If we simply say that x = −9, then these points are all
solutions, so the equation is x = −9.

Linear Models
Using linear functions to describe or approximate relationships in the real world is called
linear modeling. We start with some examples involving cost, revenue, and proﬁt.
Cost, Revenue, and Profit Functions
Example 1 Linear Cost Function
As of January, 2005, Yellow Cab Chicago’s rates were $1.90 on entering the cab plus
$1.60 for each mile.*
a. Find the cost C of an x-mile trip.
b. Use your answer to calculate the cost of a 40-mile trip.
c. What is the cost of the second mile? What is the cost of the tenth mile?
d. Graph C as a function of x.
Solution
a. We are being asked to ﬁnd how the cost C depends on the length x of the trip, or to
ﬁnd C as a function of x. Here is the cost in a few cases:
Cost of a 1-mile trip: C  1.60(1)  1.90  3.50
1 mile @ $1.60 per mile plus $1.90
Cost of a 2-mile trip: C  1.60(2)  1.90  5.10
2 miles @ $1.60 per mile plus $1.90
Cost of a 3-mile trip: C  1.60(3)  1.90  6.70
3 miles @ $1.60 per mile plus $1.90
Do you see the pattern? The cost of an x-mile trip is given by the linear function:
C(x) = 1.60x + 1.90
Notice that the slope 1.60 is the incremental cost per mile. In this context we call 1.60
the marginal cost; the varying quantity 1.60x is called the variable cost. The 
*According to their website at www.yellowcabchicago.com/.

C-intercept 1.90 is the cost to enter the cab, which we call the ﬁxed cost. In general,
a linear cost function has the following form:
Variable
cost
C(x) = mx + b


Marginal cost
Fixed cost
b. We can use the formula for the cost function to calculate the cost of a 40-mile 
trip as:
C(40) = 1.60(40) + 1.90 = $65.90
c. To calculate the cost of the second mile, we could proceed as follows:
Find the cost of a 1-mile trip: C(1)  1.60(1)  1.90  $3.50
Find the cost of a 2-mile trip: C(2)  1.60(2)  1.90  $5.10
Therefore, the cost of the second mile is $5.10  $3.50  $1.60
But notice that this is just the marginal cost. In fact, the marginal cost is the cost of
each additional mile, so we could have done this more simply:
Cost of second mile  Cost of tenth mile  Marginal cost  $1.60
d. Figure 16 shows the graph of the cost function, which we can interpret as a cost vs.
miles graph. The ﬁxed cost is the starting height on the left, while the marginal cost is
the slope of the line.

+Before we go on... In general, the slope m measures the number of units of change in
y per 1-unit change in x, so we measure m in units of y per unit of x:
Units of Slope = Units of y per unit of x
In Example 1, y is the cost C, measured in dollars, and x is the length of a trip, measured
in miles. Hence,
Units of Slope  Units of y per Unit of x  Dollars per mile
The y-intercept b, being a value of y, is measured in the same units as y. In Example 1,
b is measured in dollars. ■
Here is a summary of the terms used in the preceding example, along with an
introduction to some new terms.
Cost, Revenue, and Profit Functions
A cost function speciﬁes the cost C as a function of the number of items x. Thus,
C(x) is the cost of x items. A cost function of the form
C(x) = mx + b
is called a linear cost function. The quantity mx is called the variable cost and the
intercept b is called the ﬁxed cost. The slope m, the marginal cost, measures the incre-
mental cost per item.

quick Example
The revenue resulting from one or more business transactions is the total payment
received, sometimes called the gross proceeds. If R(x) is the revenue from selling x
items at a price of m each, then R is the linear function R(x) = mx and the selling price
m can also be called the marginal revenue.
The proﬁt, on the other hand, is the net proceeds, or what remains of the revenue
when costs are subtracted. If the proﬁt depends linearly on the number of items, the
slope m is called the marginal proﬁt. Proﬁt, revenue, and cost are related by the follow-
ing formula:
Proﬁt = Revenue −Cost
P = R −C
If the proﬁt is negative, say $500, we refer to a loss (of $500 in this case). To break-
even means to make neither a proﬁt nor a loss. Thus, break-even occurs when P = 0, or
R = C
Break-even
The break-even point is the number of items x at which break-even occurs.
If the daily cost (including operating costs) of manufacturing x T-shirts is C(x) =
8x + 100, and the revenue obtained by selling x T-shirts is R(x) = 10x, then the daily
proﬁt resulting from the manufacture and sale of x T-shirts is
P(x) = R(x) −C(x) = 10x −(8x + 100) = 2x−100
Break-even occurs when P(x) = 0, or x = 50.
Regimen is a retail shop and on-
line merchant of high-end men’s
grooming products, a small busi-
ness venture under my develop-
ment. I came up with this con-
cept in order fill the growing
demand for men’s grooming
products from both graying baby
boomers wanting to retain their
competitive edge and young men who are increasingly accept-
ing of the idea that is essential to be well styled and well
groomed. The currently $3.5 billion a year men’s grooming
market is ever-expanding and there is tremendous opportu-
nity for Regimen to take advantage of this untapped potential.
In the initial stages of this business venture I have relied
on math to calculate the amount of capital needed to launch
and sustain the business until it becomes profitable.  Using
spreadsheets I input projected sales figures and estimated
monthly expenses to formulate if it is possible to realistically
meet targets and achieve break-even in a timely matter. With
assistance from a professional interior designer, I have drawn
up plans which include space acquisition, contracting, and
construction costs in order budget for build-out expenses. 
I have teamed up with Yahoo! Small Business Solutions
and devised an online advertising strategy which allows me to
reach out to the niche customers my company’s products are
geared towards. Using a sponsored search method of adver-
tising I pre-determine how much I am willing to spend for
each combination of keywords which drive traffic onto my
website via Yahoo! I can track on a daily basis the number of
matches each combination of keywords are receiving and,
therefore, determine if any of them need to be altered. It’s
very important that I analyze these figures frequently so I
can redirect the limited marketing resources of this start-up
company into the most effective channels available. Thank-
fully, the applied mathematics techniques I learned in college
have helped me live the dream of owning my own business
and being my own boss.

We can now use the point-slope formula to construct a linear cost equation. Recall
that we need two items of information: a point on the line and the slope:
• Point Let’s use the ﬁrst point: (x1, C1)  (30,25,000)
C plays the role of y
• Slope
m = C2 −C1
x2 −x1
= 30,000 −25,000
40 −30
 500
Marginal cost  $500
The cost function is therefore
C(x) = 500x + b
where
b = C1 −mx1 = 25,000 −(500)(30) = 10,000
Fixed cost  $10,000
so         C(x) = 500x + 10,000
Because m = 500 and b = 10,000 the factory’s ﬁxed cost is $10,000 each day, and its
marginal cost is $500 per refrigerator.
b. The revenue FrozenAir obtains from the sale of a single refrigerator is $1500. So, if
it sells x refrigerators, it earns a revenue of
R(x) = 1500x
Example 2 Cost, Revenue, and Profit
The manager of the FrozenAir Refrigerator factory notices that on Monday it cost the
company a total of $25,000 to build 30 refrigerators and on Tuesday it cost $30,000 to
build 40 refrigerators.
a. Find a linear cost function based on this information. What is the daily ﬁxed cost, and
what is the marginal cost?
b. FrozenAir sells its refrigerators for $1500 each. What is the revenue function?
c. What is the proﬁt function? How many refrigerators must FrozenAir sell in a day in
order to break even for that day? What will happen if it sells fewer refrigerators? If it
sells more?
Solution
a. We are seeking C as a linear function of x, the number of refrigerators sold:
C = mx + b
We are told that C = 25,000 when x = 30, and this amounts to being told that
(30, 25,000) is a point on the graph of the cost function. Similarly, (40, 30,000) is an-
other point on the line (Figure 17).

c. For the proﬁt, we use the formula
Proﬁt = Revenue −Cost
For the cost and revenue, we can substitute the answers from parts (a) and (b) and
obtain
P(x) = R(x) −C(x)
Formula for proﬁt
= 1500x −(500x + 10,000)
Substitute R(x) and C(x)
= 1000x −10,000
Here, P(x) is the daily proﬁt FrozenAir makes by making and selling x refrigerators.
Finally, to break even means to make zero proﬁt. So, we need to ﬁnd the x such that
P(x) = 0. All we have to do is set P(x) = 0 and solve for x:
1000x −10,000 = 0
giving
x = 10,000
1000 = 10
To break even, FrozenAir needs to manufacture and sell 10 refrigerators in a day.
For values of x less than the break-even point, 10, P(x) is negative, so the com-
pany will have a loss. For values of x greater than the break-even point, P(x) is pos-
itive, so the company will make a proﬁt. This is the reason why we are interested in
the point where P(x) = 0. Since P(x) = R(x) −C(x), we can also look at the
break-even point as the point where Revenue  Cost: R(x) = C(x) (see Figure 18).

ﬁnd the break-even point graphically (Figure 18):
Cost: C(x) = 500x + 10,000
Revenue: R(x) = 1500x
The break-even point is the point where the revenue and cost are equal—that is, where
the graphs of cost and revenue cross. Figure 18 conﬁrms that break-even occurs when
x = 10 refrigerators. Or, we can use the graph to ﬁnd the break-even point in the ﬁrst

a. Model the data by expressing the demand q as a linear function of the price p.
b. How do we interpret the slope? The q-intercept?
c. How much should you charge for a can of Hot’n’Spicy beans if you want the demand
to increase to 410 cans per week?
Solution
a. A demand equation or demand function expresses demand q (in this case, the num-
ber of cans of beans sold per week) as a function of the unit price p (in this case, price
per can). We model the demand using the two points we are given: (0.50, 400) and
(0.75, 350).
Point: (0.50, 400)
Slope: m = q2 −q1
p2 −p1
= 350 −400
0.75 −0.50 = −50
0.25 = −200
Thus, the demand equation is
q = mp + b
= −200p + (400 −(−200)(0.50))
or
q = −200p + 500
Figure 19 shows the data points and the linear model.
b. The key to interpreting the slope, m = −200, is to recall (see Example 1) that we
measure the slope in units of y per unit of x. In this example, we mean units of q per
unit of p, or the number of cans sold per dollar change in the price. Because m is neg-
ative, we see that the number of cans sold decreases as the price increases. We con-
clude that the weekly sales will drop by 200 cans per $1-increase in the price.

You run a small supermarket, and must determine how much to charge for Hot’n’Spicy
brand baked beans. The following chart shows weekly sales ﬁgures for Hot’n’Spicy at
two different prices.
place. If we use technology, we can “zoom in” for an accurate estimate of the point of
intersection.
Excel has an interesting feature called “Goal Seek” that can be used to ﬁnd the point
of intersection of two lines numerically (rather than graphically). The downloadable
Excel tutorial for this section contains detailed instructions on using Goal Seek to ﬁnd
break-even points. ■
Demand and Supply Functions
The demand for a commodity usually goes down as its price goes up. It is traditional to
use the letter q for the (quantity of) demand, as measured, for example, in weekly sales.
Consider the following example.

To interpret the q-intercept, recall that it gives the q-coordinate when p = 0.
Hence it is the number of cans the supermarket can “sell” every week if it were to give
them away.*
c. If we want the demand to increase to 410 cans per week, we set q = 410 and solve
for p:
410 = −200p + 500
200p = 90
p = 90
200 = $0.45/can

quick Example
Demand Function
A demand equation or demand function expresses demand q (the number of items de-
manded) as a function of the unit price p (the price per item). A linear demand func-
tion has the form
q( p) = mp + b
Interpretation of m
The (usually negative) slope m measures the change in demand per unit change in price.
For instance, if p is measured in dollars and q in monthly sales and m = −400, then each
$1 increase in the price per item will result in a drop in sales of 400 items per month.
Interpretation of b
The y-intercept b gives the demand if the items were given away.
If the demand for T-shirts, measured in daily sales, is given by q( p) = −4p + 90, where
p is the sale price in dollars, then daily sales drop by four T-shirts for every $1 increase
in price. If the T-shirts were given away, the demand would be 90 T-shirts per day.
* Does this seem realistic? Demand is not always unlimited if items were given away. For instance, campus
newspapers are sometimes given away, and yet piles of them are often left untaken. Also see the “Before we
go on . . .” discussion at the end of this example.
Before we go on...
Q: Just how reliable is the linear model used in Example 3 ?
A: The actual demand graph could in principle be obtained by tabulating new sales figures for a
large number of different prices. If the resulting points were plotted on the pq plane, they
would probably suggest a curve and not a straight line. However, if you looked at a small enough
portion of this curve, you could closely approximate it by a straight line. In other words, over a
small range of values of p, the linear model is accurate. Linear models of real-world situations
are generally reliable only for small ranges of the variables. (This point will come up again in
some of the exercises.) ■
We have seen that a demand function gives the number of items consumers are
willing to buy at a given price, and a higher price generally results in a lower demand.
However, as the price rises, suppliers will be more inclined to produce these items (as
opposed to spending their time and money on other products), so supply will generally

quantity of demand, particularly when we want to compare them, as in the next example.

Continuing with Example 3, consider the following chart, which shows weekly sales ﬁg-
ures (the demand) for Hot’n’Spicy at two different prices, as well as the number of cans
per week that you are prepared to place on sale (the supply) at these prices.
rise. A supply function gives q, the number of items suppliers are willing to make avail-
able for sale28, as a function of p, the price per item.
a. Model these data with linear demand and supply functions.
b. How much should you charge per can of Hot’n’Spicy beans if you want the demand
to equal the supply? How many cans will you sell at that price, known as the equili-
brium price? What happens if you charge more than the equilibrium price? What
happens if you charge less?
Solution
a. We have already modeled the demand function in Example 3:
q = −200p + 500
To model the supply, we use the ﬁrst and third rows of the table. We are again given
two points: (0.50, 300) and (0.75, 500):
Point: (0.50, 300)
Slope: m = q2 −q1
p2 −p1
= 500 −300
0.75 −0.50 = 200
0.25 = 800
So, the supply equation is
q = mp + b
= 800p + [300 −(800)(0.50)]
= 800p −100
b. To ﬁnd where the demand equals the supply, we equate the two functions:
Demand = Supply
−200p + 500 = 800p −100
−1000p = −600
so
p = −600
−1000 = $0.60
This is the equilibrium price. We can ﬁnd the corresponding demand by substituting
0.60 for p in the demand (or supply) equation.
Equilibrium demand  200(0.60)  500  380 cans per week

So, to balance supply and demand, you should charge $0.60 per can of Hot’n’Spicy
beans and you should place 380 cans on sale each week.
If we graph supply and demand on the same set of axes, we obtain the graphs
shown in Figure 20.

Supply Function and Equilibrium Price
A supply equation or supply function expresses supply q (the number of items a sup-
plier is willing to make available) as a function of the unit price p (the price per item). A
linear supply function has the form
q( p) = mp + b
It is usually the case that supply increases as the unit price increases, so m is usually
positive.
Demand and supply are said to be in equilibrium when demand equals supply. The
corresponding values of p and q are called the equilibrium price and equilibrium
demand. To ﬁnd the equilibrium price, set demand equal to supply and solve for the unit
price p. To ﬁnd the equilibrium demand, evaluate the demand (or supply) function at the
equilibrium price.
Figure 20 shows what happens if you charge prices other than the equilibrium price.
If you charge, say, $0.90 per can (p = 0.90) then the supply will be larger than demand
and there will be a weekly surplus. Similarly, if you charge less—say $0.30 per can—
then the supply will be less than the demand, and there will be a shortage of Hot’n’Spicy
beans.

Equilibrium occurs at the point of intersection of the
graphs of supply and demand.
Before we go on... We just saw in Example 4 that if you charge less than the equilib-
rium price, there will be a shortage. If you were to raise your price toward the equilib-
rium, you would sell more items and increase revenue, since it is the supply equation—
and not the demand equation—that determines what you can sell below the equilibrium
price. On the other hand, if you charge more than the equilibrium price, you will be left
with a possibly costly surplus of unsold items (and will want to lower prices to reduce
the surplus). Prices tend to move toward the equilibrium, so supply tends to equal de-
mand. When supply equals demand, we say that the market clears. ■

a. Use these data to model total sales of GPS-based products as a linear function of time
t measured in years since 1994. What is the signiﬁcance of the slope?
b. Use the model to predict when sales of GPS-based products will reach $13.3 billion,
assuming they continue to grow at the same rate.
Solution
a. First, notice that 1994 corresponds to t = 0 and 2000 to t = 6. Thus, we are given the
coordinates of two points on the graph of sales s as a function of time t: (0, 0.8) and
(6, 8.3). The slope is
m = s2 −s1
t2 −t1
= 8.3 −0.8
6 −0
= 7.5
6 = 1.25
Using the point (0, 0.8), we get
s = mt + b
= 1.25t + 0.8 −(1.25)(0)
= 1.25t + 0.8
Notice that we calculated the slope as the ratio (change in sales)/(change in time).
Thus, m is the rate of change of sales and is measured in units of sales per unit of time,
or billions of dollars per year. In other words, to say that m = 1.25 is to say that sales
are increasing by $1.25 billion per year.
b. Our model of sales as a function of time is
s = 1.25t + 0.8
Sales of GPS-based products will reach $13.3 billion when s = 13.3, or
13.3 = 1.25t + 0.8
Solving for t, 
1.25t = 13.3 −0.8 = 12.5
t = 12.5
1.25 = 10
In 2004 (t = 10), sales are predicted to reach $13.3 billion.

Linear Change Over Time
If a quantity q is a linear function of time t, so that
q(t) = mt + b
then the slope m measures the rate of change of q, and b is the quantity at time t = 0,
the initial quantity. If q represents the position of a moving object, then the rate of
change is also called the velocity.
Units of m and b
The units of measurement of m are units of q per unit of time; for instance, if q is income
in dollars and t is time in years, then the rate of change m is measured in dollars per year.
The units of b are units of q; for instance, if q is income in dollars and t is time in
years, then b is measured in dollars.
If the accumulated revenue from sales of your video game software is given by
R(t) = 2000t + 500 dollars, where t is time in years from now, then you have earned $500
in revenue so far, and the accumulated revenue is increasing at a rate of $2000 per year.

Find your location s as a function of t, the number of hours you have been driving. (The
number s is also called your position or displacement.)
Solution
If we plot the location s versus the time t, the ﬁve markers listed give us the graph in
Figure 21.
These points appear to lie along a straight line. We can verify this by calculating
how far you traveled in each half hour. In the ﬁrst half hour, you traveled 47– 20  27
miles. In the second half hour you traveled 74 – 47  27 miles also. In fact, you traveled
exactly 27 miles each half hour. The points we plotted lie on a straight line that rises
27 units for every 0.5 unit we go to the right, for a slope of 27/0.5  54.
To get the equation of that line, notice that we have the s-intercept, which is the
starting marker of 20. From the slope intercept form (using s in place of y and t in place
of x) we get:
s(t) = 54t + 20
Notice the signiﬁcance of the slope: For every hour you travel, you drive a distance of
54 miles. In other words, you are traveling at a constant velocity of 54 mph. We have un-
covered a very important principle:
In the graph of displacement versus time, velocity is given by the slope.

General Linear Models
If y = mx + b is a linear model of changing quantities x and y, then the slope m is the
rate at which y is increasing per unit increase in x, and the y-intercept b is the value of y
that corresponds to x = 0.
Units of m and b
The slope m is measured in units of y per unit of x, and the intercept b is measured in
units of y.

FAQs
What to Use as x and y, and How to Interpret a Linear Model
Q: In a problem where I must find a linear relationship between two quantities, which quantity
do I use as x and which do I use as y?
A: The key is to decide which of the two quantities is the independent variable, and which is the
dependent variable. Then use the independent variable as x and the dependent variable as y. In
other words, y depends on x.
Here are examples of phrases that convey this information, usually of the form Find y
[dependent variable] in terms of x [independent variable]:
• Find the cost in terms of the number of items.
y  Cost, x  # Items
• How does color depend on wavelength?
y  Color, x  Wavelength
If no information is conveyed about which variable is intended to be independent, then you can
use whichever is convenient. ■
Q: How do I interpret a general linear model y = mx + b?
A: The key to interpreting a linear model is to remember the units we use to measure m and b:
The slope m is measured in units of y per unit of x; the intercept b is measured in units of y.
For instance, if y = 4.3x + 8.1 and you know that x is measured in feet and y in kilograms,
then you can already say, “y is 8.1 kilograms when x = 0 feet, and increases at a rate of 
4.3 kilograms per foot” without even knowing anything more about the situation! ■

32. Muscle Recovery Time Most workout enthusiasts will tell you
that muscle recovery time is about 48 hours. But it is not quite
as simple as that; the recovery time ought to depend on the
number of sets you do involving the muscle group in ques-
tion. For example, if you do no sets of biceps exercises, then
the recovery time for your biceps is (of course) zero. To take
a compromise position, let’s assume that if you do three sets
of exercises on a muscle group, then its recovery time is 48
hours. Use these data to write a linear function that gives the
recovery time (in hours) in terms of the number of sets
affecting a particular muscle. Use this model to calculate how
long it would take your biceps to recover if you did 15 sets of
curls. Comment on your answer with reference to the useful-
ness of a linear model.

Rose’s counterfeit Chanel Nº 22.5 racket has run into difﬁcul-

been selling the counterfeit perfume for $600 per gram, and
his costs are $400 per gram plus $30 per gram transportation
costs and commission. (The perfume’s smell is easily detected
by specially trained Chanel Hounds, and this necessitates
elaborate packaging measures.) He therefore decides to price
it at $420 per gram in order to undercut the competition.

Linear Regression
We have seen how to ﬁnd a linear model, given two data points: We ﬁnd the equation
of the line that passes through them. However, we often have more than two data points,
and they will rarely all lie on a single straight line, but may often come close to doing
so. The problem is to ﬁnd the line coming closest to passing through all of the points.
Suppose, for example, that we are conducting research for a cable TV company in-
terested in expanding into China and we come across the following ﬁgures showing the
growth of the cable market there.51

These points suggest a line, although they clearly do not all lie on a single straight line.
Figure 22B shows the points together with several lines, some ﬁtting better than others.
Can we precisely measure which lines ﬁt better than others? For instance, which of the
two lines labeled as “good” ﬁts in Figure 22B models the data more accurately? We
begin by considering, for each of the years 1996 through 2003, the difference between
the actual number of households with cable (the observed value) and the number of
households with cable predicted by a linear equation (the predicted value). The differ-
ence between the predicted value and the observed value is called the residual.
Residual = Observed Value −Predicted Value
On the graph, the residuals measure the vertical distances between the (observed) data
points and the line (Figure 23) and they tell us how far the linear model is from predict-
ing the number of households with cable.

The more accurate our model, the smaller the residuals should be. We can combine
all the residuals into a single measure of accuracy by adding their squares. (We square
the residuals in part to make them all positive.52) The sum of the squares of the residu-
als is called the sum-of-squares error, SSE. Smaller values of SSE indicate more ac-
curate models.
Here are some deﬁnitions and formulas for what we have been discussing.
84
Chapter 1
Functions and Linear Models
52 Why not add the absolute values of the residuals instead? Mathematically, using the squares rather than the
absolute values results in a simpler and more elegant solution. Further, using the the squares always results in
a single best-ﬁt line in cases where the x-coordinates are all different, whereas this is not the case if we use
absolute values.

Observed and Predicted Values
Suppose we are given a collection of data points (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn). The n quantities
y1, y2, . . . , yn are called the observed y-values. If we model these data with a linear
equation
ˆy = mx + b
ˆy stands for “estimated y” or “predicted y.”
then the y-values we get by substituting the given x-values into the equation are called
the predicted y-values.
ˆy1 = mx1 + b
Substitute x1 for x.
ˆy2 = mx2 + b
Substitute x2 for x.
· · ·
ˆyn = mxn + b
Substitute xn for x.
Consider the three data points (0, 2), (2, 5), and (3, 6). The observed y-values are y1 = 2,
y2 = 5, and y3 = 6. If we model these data with the equation ˆy = x + 2.5, then the
predicted values are:
ˆy1 = x1 + 2.5 = 0 + 2.5 = 2.5
ˆy2 = x2 + 2.5 = 2 + 2.5 = 4.5
ˆy3 = x3 + 2.5 = 3 + 2.5 = 5.5
Residuals and Sum-of-Squares Error (SSE)
If we model a collection of data (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) with a linear equation ˆy = mx + b,
then the residuals are the n quantities (Observed Value – Predicted Value):
(y1 −ˆy1), (y2 −ˆy2), . . . , (yn −ˆyn)
The sum-of-squares error (SSE) is the sum of the squares of the residuals:
SSE = (y1 −ˆy1)2 + (y2 −ˆy2)2 + (yn −ˆyn)2
For the data and linear approximation given above, the residuals are:
y1 −ˆy1 = 2 −2.5 = −0.5
y2 −ˆy2 = 5 −4.5 = 0.5
y3 −ˆy3 = 6 −5.5 = 0.5
and       SSE = (−0.5)2 + (0.5)2 + (0.5)2 = 0.75

Example 1 Computing the Sum-of-Squares Error
Using the data above on the cable television market in China, compute SSE, the sum-of-
squares error, for the linear models y = 8t + 72 and y = 5t + 68. Which model is the
better ﬁt?
Solution We begin by creating a table showing the values of t, the observed (given)
values of y, and the values predicted by the ﬁrst model.

using Technology
Consult the Technology Guides
at the end of the chapter to see
how to generate these tables
using a TI-83/84 or Excel. We
can use either technology to
graph the original data points
and the lines.
We now add two new columns for the residuals and their squares.
SSE, the sum of the squares of the residuals, is then the sum of the entries in the last
column,
SSE = 479
Repeating the process using the second model, y = 5t + 68, yields SSE = 23. Thus, the
second model is a better ﬁt.

Before we go on...
Q: It seems clear from the figures that the second model in Example 1 gives a better fit. Why
bother to compute SSE to tell me this?
A: The difference between the two models we chose is so dramatic that it is clear from the
graphs which is the better fit. However, if we used a third model with m = 5 and b = 68.1,
then its graph would be almost indistinguishable from that of the second, but a better fit as
measured by SSE = 22.88. ■
Among all possible lines, there ought to be one with the least possible value of
SSE—that is, the greatest possible accuracy as a model. The line (and there is only one
such line) that minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals is called the regression
line, the least-squares line, or the best-ﬁt line.
To ﬁnd the regression line, we need a way to ﬁnd values of m and b that give the
smallest possible value of SSE. As an example, let us take the second linear model in the
example above. We said in the “Before we go on . . .” discussion that increasing b from
68 to 68.1 had the desirable effect of decreasing SSE from 23 to 22.88. We could then
decrease m to 4.9, further reducing SSE to 22.2. Imagine this as a kind of game: Alter-
nately alter the values of m and b by small amounts until SSE is as small as you can
make it. This works, but is extremely tedious and time-consuming.
Fortunately, there is an algebraic way to ﬁnd the regression line. Here is the calcu-
lation. To justify it rigorously requires calculus of several variables or linear algebra.

Regression Line
The regression line (least squares line, best-ﬁt line) associated with the points (x1, y1),
(x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn) is the line that gives the minimum sum-of-squares error (SSE). The
regression line is
y = mx + b
where m and b are computed as follows:
m = n(xy) −(x)(y)
n(x2) −(x)2
b = y −m(x)
n
n = number of data points
The quantities m and b are called the regression coefﬁcients.
Here, “” means “the sum of.” Thus, for example,
x = Sum of the x-values = x1 + x2 + · · · + xn
xy = Sum of products = x1y1 + x2y2 + · · · + xnyn
x2 = Sum of the squares of the x-values = x1
2 + x2
2 + · · · + xn

On the other hand,
(x)2 = Square of x = Square of the sum of the x-values

x = 5 and get y ≈92 million households.
Coefficient of Correlation
If all the data points do not lie on one straight line, we would like to be able to measure
how closely they can be approximated by a straight line. Recall that SSE measures the
sum of the squares of the deviations from the regression line; therefore it constitutes a

measurement of goodness of ﬁt. (For instance, if SSE = 0, then all the points lie on a
straight line.) However, SSE depends on the units we use to measure y, and also on the
number of data points (the more data points we use, the larger SSE tends to be). Thus,
while we can (and do) use SSE to compare the goodness of ﬁt of two lines to the same
data, we cannot use it to compare the goodness of ﬁt of one line to one set of data with
that of another to a different set of data.
To remove this dependency, statisticians have found a related quantity that can be
used to compare the goodness of ﬁt of lines to different sets of data. This quantity, called
the coefﬁcient of correlation or correlation coefﬁcient, and usually denoted r, is be-
tween −1 and 1. The closer r is to −1 or 1, the better the ﬁt. For an exact ﬁt, we would
have r = −1 (for a line with negative slope) or r = 1 (for a line with positive slope). For
a bad ﬁt, we would have r close to 0. Figure 24 shows several collections of data points
with least squares lines and the corresponding values of r.

Correlation Coefficient
The coefﬁcient of correlation of the n data points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn) is

n(x2) −(x)2 ·

n(y2) −(y)2
It measures how closely the data points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn) ﬁt the regression
line.
Interpretation
If r is positive, the regression line has positive slope; if r is negative, the regression line
has negative slope.
If r = 1 or −1, then all the data points lie exactly on the regression line; if it is close
to ±1, then all the data points are close to the regression line.
If r is close to 0, then y does not depend linearly on x.
Example 3 Computing the Coefficient of Correlation
Find the correlation coefﬁcient for the data in Example 2. Is the regression line a

Solution
The formula for r requires x, x2, xy, y, and y2. We have all of these except for

Applications
22. As your online bookstore, OHaganBooks.com, has grown in
popularity, you have been monitoring book sales as a function
of the trafﬁc at your site (measured in “hits” per day) and have
obtained the following model:
n(x) =
 0.02x
if 0 ≤x ≤1000
0.025x −5
if 1000 < x ≤2000
where n(x) is the average number of books sold in a day in
which there are x hits at the site.
a. On average, how many books per day does your model
predict you will sell when you have 500 hits in a day?
1000 hits in a day? 1500 hits in a day?
b. What does the coefﬁcient 0.025 tell you about your book
sales?
c. According to the model, how many hits per day will be
needed in order to sell an average of 30 books per day?
23. Your monthly books sales have increased quite dramatically
over the past few months, but now appear to be leveling off.
Here are the sales ﬁgures for the past 6 months.
You decide to construct a linear model giving the average
number of hits h per day as a function of the advertising
expenditure c.
a. What is the model you obtain?
b. Based on your model, how much trafﬁc can you anticipate
if you budget $6000 per month for 
banner ads?
c. Your goal is to eventually increase trafﬁc at your site to an
average of 2500 hits per day. Based on your model, how
much do you anticipate you will need to spend on banner
ads in order to accomplish this?
25. A month ago you increased expenditure on banner ads to
$6000 per month, and you have noticed that the trafﬁc at
OHaganBooks.com has not increased to the level predicted by
the linear model in Exercise 24. Fitting a quadratic function to
the data you have gives the model
h = −0.000005c2 + 0.085c + 1750
where h is the daily trafﬁc (hits) at your website, and c is the
monthly advertising expenditure.
a. According to this model, what is the current trafﬁc at your
site?
b. Does this model give a reasonable prediction of trafﬁc at
expenditures larger than $8500 per month? Why?
26. Besides selling books, you are generating additional revenue
at OHaganBooks.com through your new online publishing
service. Readers pay a fee to download the entire text of a
novel. Author royalties and copyright fees cost you an average
of $4 per novel, and the monthly cost of operating and main-
taining the service amounts to $900 per month. You are cur-
rently charging readers $5.50 per novel.
a. What are the associated cost, revenue, and proﬁt
functions?
b. How many novels must you sell per month in order to
break even?
c. If you lower the charge to $5.00 per novel, how many
books will you need to sell in order to break even?
27. In order to generate a proﬁt from your online publishing ser-
vice, you need to know how the demand for novels depends
on the price you charge. During the ﬁrst month of the service,
you were charging $10 per novel, and sold 350. Lowering the
price to $5.50 per novel had the effect of increasing demand
to 620 novels per month.
a. Use the given data to construct a linear demand 
equation.
b. Use the demand equation you constructed in part (a) to
estimate the demand if you raised the price to $15 per
novel.
c. Using the information on cost given in Exercise 26,
determine which of the three prices ($5.50, $10 and $15)
would result in the largest proﬁt, and the size of that
proﬁt.

have the following data on the average number of hits per
day at OHaganBooks.com versus your monthly advertising
expenditures:

department informs me that, based on a regression of the most recently available data, Internet
advertising revenue in the U.S. will continue grow at a rate of approximately $1 billion per year. This
translates into approximately $2.5 million in increased revenues per year for Impact, given our 0.25%
market share. This rate of expansion is exactly what our planned 2006 budget anticipates. Your
proposal, on the other hand, would require a budget of approximately twice the 2006 budget allocation,
even though your proposal provides no hard evidence to justify this degree of ﬁnancial backing.
At this stage, therefore, I am sorry to say that I am inclined not to approve the funding for your project,
although I would be happy to discuss this further with you. I plan to present my ﬁnal decision on the
2006 budget at next week’s divisional meeting.

York Times, June 7, 1999, p. C17.
*Note that this r is not the linear correlation coefﬁcient we deﬁned on p. 92; what this r measures is how
closely the quadratic regression model ﬁts the data.
Regression Model: y = 0.9857x −0.6571 (x = years since 1999)
Correlation Coefﬁcient: r = 0.9781
Now you see where the VP got that $1 billion ﬁgure: The slope of the regression
equation is close to 1, indicating a rate of increase of just under $1 billion per year. Also,
the correlation coefﬁcient is very high—an indication that the linear model ﬁts the data
well. In view of this strong evidence, it seems difﬁcult to argue that revenues will in-
crease by signiﬁcantly more than the projected $1 billion per year.
To get a better picture of what’s going on, you decide to graph the data together with
the regression line in your spreadsheet program. What you get is shown in Figure 25.
You immediately notice that the data points seem to suggest a curve, and not a
straight line. Then again, perhaps the suggestion of a curve is an illusion. Thus there are,
you surmise, two possible interpretations of the data:
1. (Your ﬁrst impression) As a function of time, spending on Internet advertising is non-
linear, and is in fact accelerating (the rate of change is increasing), so a linear model
is inappropriate.
2. (Devil’s advocate) Spending on Internet advertising is a linear function of time; the
fact that the points do not lie on the regression line is simply a consequence of ran-
dom factors, such as the state of the economy, the stock market performance, etc.
You suspect that the VP will probably opt for the second interpretation and discount
the graphical evidence of accelerating growth by claiming that it is an illusion: a
“statistical ﬂuctuation.” That is, of course, a possibility, but you wonder how likely it
really is.
For the sake of comparison, you decide to try a regression based on the simplest
non-linear model you can think of—a quadratic function.
y = ax2 + bx + c
Your spreadsheet allows you to ﬁt such a function with a click of the mouse. The result
is the following.
y = 0.1190x2 + 0.2714x −0.0619
(x = number of years since 1999)
r = 0.9992
See Note.*
Figure 26 shows the graph of the regression function together with the original data.
Aha! The ﬁt is visually far better, and the correlation coefﬁcient is even higher!
Further, the quadratic model predicts 2006 spending as
y = 0.1190(7)2 + 0.2714(7) −0.0619 ≈$7.67 billion

which is $1.87 billion above the 2005 spending ﬁgure in the table above. Given Impact
Advertising’s 0.25% market share, this translates into an increase in revenues of $4.7
million, which is almost double the estimate predicted by the linear model!
You quickly draft an e-mail to Lombardo, and are about to press “send” when you
decide, as a precaution, to check with a statistician. He tells you to be cautious: the value
of r will always tend to increase if you pass from a linear model to a quadratic one due
to an increase in “degrees of freedom.”65 A good way to test whether a quadratic model
is more appropriate than a linear one is to compute a statistic called the “p-value” asso-
ciated with the coefﬁcient of x2. A low value of p indicates a high degree of conﬁdence
that the coefﬁcient of x2 cannot be zero (see below). Notice that if the coefﬁcient of x2
is zero, then you have a linear model.
You can, your friend explains, obtain the p-value using Excel as follows. First, set
up the data in columns, with an extra column for the values of x2.
Case Study
97
Figure 27
65 The number of degrees of freedom in a regression model is 1 less than the number of coefﬁcients. For a
linear model, it is 1 (there are two coefﬁcients: the slope m and the intercept b), and for a quadratic model it
is 2. For a detailed discussion, consult a text on regression analysis.
Next, choose “Data analysis” from the “Tools” menu, and choose “Regression.” In the
dialogue box, give the location of the data as shown in Figure 27.

Clicking “OK” then gives you a large chart of statistics. The p-value you want is in the
very last row of the data: p = 0.000478.
Q: What does p actually measure?
A: Roughly speaking, 1 −p = .999522 gives the degree of confidence you can have (99.9522%)
in asserting that the coefficient of x2 is not zero. (Technically, p is the probability—allowing for
random fluctuation in the data—that, if the coefficient of x2 were in fact zero, the “t-statistic”
(10.4257, right next to the p-value on the spreadsheet) could be as large as it is. ■
In short, you can go ahead and send your e-mail with 99% conﬁdence!

Example 3 Evaluate the function f (x) = −0.4x2+
7x −23 for x = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 10.
Solution with Technology There are several ways to eval-
uate an algebraically deﬁned function on a graphing calcu-
lator such as the TI-83/84.
1. Enter the function in the Y  screen, as
Y1 = -0.4*X^2+7*X-23
Negative (-) and minus () are different
keys on the TI-83/84.
or
Y1 = -0.4X2+7X-23
(See Chapter 0 for a discussion of technology formulas.)
2. To evaluate f (0), for example, enter the following in the
home screen:
Y1(0)
This evaluates the function Y1 at 0.
Alternatively, you can use the table feature:
1. After entering the function under Y1, press 
, and set Indpnt to Ask. (You do this once and
for all; it will permit you to specify values for x in the
table screen.)
2. Press 
, and you will be able to evaluate the
function at several values of x. Here is a table showing
some of the values requested:

Solution with Technology The following formula deﬁnes
the function V on the TI-83/84:
(X≤5)*(90-4*X)+(X>5)*(60+2*X)
The logical operators (≤and >, for example) can be
found by pressing 
.
When x is less than or equal to 5, the logical expres-
sion (x≤5) evaluates to 1 because it is true, and the ex-
pression (x>5) evaluates to 0 because it is false. The
value of the function is therefore given by the expression
(90-4*x). When x is greater than 5, the expression
(x≤5) evaluates to 0 while the expression (x>5) evalu-
ates to 1, so the value of the function is given by the ex-
pression (60+2*x).
As in Example 3, you can use the Table feature to com-
pute several values of the function at once:

Solution with Technology You can compute the succes-

1. Enter the values of x and f (x) in the lists L1 and L2,
which is most easily done using the stat list editor
(
EDIT).
2. Highlight the heading L3 and enter the following for-
mula (with the quotes, as explained below):
“List(L2)/List(L1)”
The “List” function is found under 
OPS and
computes the differences between successive elements of
a list, returning a list with one less element. The formula
above then computes the quotients y/x in the list L3.
As you can see in the third column, f (x) is not linear.
To redo the computation for g(x), all you need to do is edit
the values of L2 in the stat list editor. By putting quotes
around the formula we used for L3, we “attached” the for-
mula to L3 so that it would update automatically.

What was the approximate price of EBAY stock after 1

Solution with Technology The following formula deﬁnes
the function V in Excel:
(x<=5)*(90-4*x)+(x>5)*(60+2*x)
When x is less than or equal to 5, the logical expression
(x<=5) evaluates to 1 because it is true, and the expres-
sion (x>5) evaluates to 0 because it is false. The value of
the function is therefore given by the expression (90-
4*x). When x is greater than 5, the expression (x<=5)
evaluates to 0 while the expression (x>5) evaluates to 1,
so the value of the function is given by the expression
(60+2*x).
We can set up a worksheet as shown (see Example 3
for instructions on using a formula to obtain values of a
function in Excel).

Using the IF Function in Excel
The following worksheet shows how we can get the same
result using the IF function in Excel:
you charge according to the formula
R( p) = −5600p2 + 14,000p
(0 ≤p ≤2.5)
(R and p are in dollars.) Sketch the graph of R. Find the ac-
cess fee that will result in the largest monthly revenue.
Solution with Technology
1. Begin by creating a table of values for the function, as in
Example 3 of Section 1.1, by entering the values of the
independent variable p in column A and the formula for
the function in cell B2, then copying the formula into the
cells beneath it as shown.
The IF function evaluates its ﬁrst argument, which
tests to see if the value of t is in the range t ≤5. If the ﬁrst
argument is true, IF returns the result of evaluating its sec-
ond argument: 90-4*A2; if not, it returns the result of
evaluating its third argument: 60+2*A2.
In either case, the ﬁnal result will look something like
this:
Section 1.2
Example 2 The monthly revenue R from users logging on
to your gaming site depends on the monthly access fee p
2. To draw the graph shown in Figure 4(a) of Section 1.2,
select (highlight) both columns of data and then ask
Excel to insert a chart.
3. When it asks you to specify what type of chart, select the
XY (Scatter) option. This tells the program that your
data specify the x- and y-coordinates of a sequence of
points. In the same dialogue box, select the option that
shows points connected by lines.
4. Press Next to bring up a new dialogue called Data
Type, where you should make sure that the Series
in Columns option is selected, telling the program
that the x- and y-coordinates are arranged vertically,
down columns.
5. You can then set various other options, add labels, and
otherwise ﬁddle with it until it looks nice.
To get a smoother curve, you need to plot many more
points. Here is a method of plotting 100 points (in addi-
tion to the starting point), similar to the Excel worksheet
posted online that you can ﬁnd by following:

Moreover, if you decide to follow this method, you can save the resulting spreadsheet and use it as an “Excel graph-
ing calculator” to graph any other function (see below).
1. Set up your worksheet as follows:
(Columns C and D are empty in case you want to add additional functions to graph.) The 101 values of the x-coordinate
(the price p) will appear in column A. The corresponding values of the y-coordinate (the revenue R) will appear in column
B. In column F you see some settings: Xmin = 0 and Xmax = 2.5 (see Figure 4). Delta X (in cell F5) is the amount by
which the x-coordinate is increased as you go from one x-value in column A to the next, starting with Xmin in A2. Enter
the formula for R( p) in Cell B2 and copy it into the other cells in column B as shown.
2. When done, graph the data in columns A and B, choosing the scatter plot option with subtype Points connected
by lines with no markers.
Save this worksheet with its graph and you can use it to graph new functions as follows:
1. Enter the new values for Xmin and Xmax in column F.
2. Enter the new function in cell B2 (using A2 in place of x).
3. Copy the contents of cell B2 to cells B3–B102.

Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices
Introduction
In Chapter 1 we studied single functions and equations. In this chapter we seek solutions
to systems of two or more equations. For example, suppose we need to ﬁnd two numbers
whose sum is 3 and whose difference is 1. In other words, we need to ﬁnd two numbers
x and y such that x + y = 3 and x −y = 1. The only solution turns out to be x = 2 and
y = 1, a solution you might easily guess. But, how do we know that this is the only
solution, and how do we ﬁnd solutions systematically? When we restrict ourselves to
systems of linear equations, there is a very elegant method for determining the number
of solutions and ﬁnding them all. Moreover, as we will see, many real-world applica-
tions give rise to just such systems of linear equations.
We begin in Section 2.1 with systems of two linear equations in two unknowns and
some of their applications. In Section 2.2 we study a powerful matrix method, called
row reduction, for solving systems of linear equations in any number of unknowns. In
Section 2.3 we look at more applications.
Computers have been used for many years to solve the large systems of equations
that arise in the real world. You probably already have access to devices that will do
the row operations used in row reduction. Many graphing calculators can do them, as
can spreadsheets and various special-purpose applications, including utilities avail-
able at the website. Using such a device or program makes the calculations quicker
and helps avoid arithmetic mistakes. Then there are programs (and calculators) into
which you simply feed the system of equations and out pop the solutions. We can
think of what we do in this chapter as looking inside the “black box” of such a pro-
gram. More important, we talk about how, starting from a real-world problem, to get
the system of equations to solve in the ﬁrst place. This conversion no computer will
yet do for us.
Systems of Two Equations in Two Unknowns
Suppose you have $3 in your pocket to spend on snacks and a drink. If x represents the
amount you’ll spend on snacks and y represents the amount you’ll spend on a drink, you
can say that x + y = 3. On the other hand, if for some reason you want to spend $1 more
on snacks than on your drink, you can also say that x −y = 1. These are simple exam-
ples of linear equations in two unknowns.
quick Example
Linear Equations in Two Unknowns
A linear equation in two unknowns is an equation that can be written in the form
ax + by = c
with a, b, and c being real numbers. The number a is called the coefﬁcient of x and b is
called the coefﬁcient of y. A solution of an equation consists of a pair of numbers: a
value for x and a value for y that satisfy the equation.
In the linear equation 3x −y = 15, the coefﬁcients are a = 3 and b = −1. The point
(x, y) = (5, 0) is a solution, since 3(5) −(0) = 15.

In fact, a single linear equation like 3x −y = 15 has inﬁnitely many solutions: We
could solve for y = 3x −15 and then, for every value of x we choose, we can get the
corresponding value of y, giving a solution (x, y). As we saw in Chapter 1, these solu-
tions are the points on a straight line, the graph of the equation.
In this section we are concerned with pairs (x, y) that are solutions of two linear
equations at the same time. For example, (2, 1) is a solution of both of the equations
x + y = 3 and x −y = 1, since substituting x = 2 and y = 1 into these equations
gives 2 + 1 = 3 (true) and 2 −1 = 1 (also true), respectively. So, in the simple exam-
ple we began with, you could spend $2 on snacks and $1 on a drink.
In the following set of examples, you will see how to graphically and algebraically
solve a system of two linear equations in two unknowns. Then we’ll return to some more
interesting applications.

equal. That is, if A = B and C = D, then A + C = B + D.
using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter to ﬁnd
out how to use a TI-83/84 or
Excel to help solve a system
graphically.
Example 1 Two Ways of Solving a System: Graphically 
and Algebraically
Find all solutions (x, y) of the following system of two equations:
x + y = 3
x −y = 1
Solution We will see how to ﬁnd the solution(s) in two ways: graphically and alge-
braically. Remember that a solution is a pair (x, y) that simultaneously satisﬁes both
equations.
Method 1: Graphical We already know that the solutions of a single linear equation are
the points on its graph, which is a straight line. For a point to represent a solution of two
linear equations, it must lie simultaneously on both of the corresponding lines. In other
words, it must be a point where the two lines cross, or intersect. A look at Figure 1 should
convince us that the lines cross only at the point (2, 1), so this is the only possible solution.
Method 2: Algebraic In the algebraic approach, we try to combine the equations in
such a way as to eliminate one variable. In this case, notice that if we add the left-hand
sides of the equations, the terms with y are eliminated. So, we add the ﬁrst equation to
the second (that is, add the left-hand sides and add the right-hand sides*):
x + y = 3
x −y = 1
2x + 0 = 4
2x
= 4
x
= 2
Now that we know that x has to be 2, we can substitute back into either equation to
ﬁnd y. Choosing the ﬁrst equation (it doesn’t matter which we choose), we have
2 + y = 3
y = 3 −2
= 1
We have found that the only possible solution is x = 2 and y = 1, or
(x, y) = (2, 1)

Graphing these equations, we get Figure 2.
+Before we go on... In our discussion of the break-even point in Section 1.4, we found
the intersection of two straight lines by setting equal two linear functions of x (cost and
revenue). We could ﬁnd the solution in Example 1 here in a similar way: First we solve
our two equations for y to obtain
y = −x + 3
y = x −1
and then we equate the right-hand sides and solve to ﬁnd x = 2. The value for y is then
found by substituting x = 2 in either equation. ■
Q: So why don’t we solve all systems of equations this way?
A: The elimination method extends more easily to systems with more equations and unknowns.
It is the basis for the matrix method of solving systems—a method we discuss in Section 2.2.
So, we shall use it exclusively for the rest of this section. ■
Example 2 illustrates the drawbacks of the graphical method.
The lines appear to intersect slightly above and to the left of the origin. Redrawing with a
ﬁner scale (or zooming in using graphing technology), we can get the graph in Figure 3.
If we look carefully at Figure 3, we see that the graphs intersect near (−0.45, 0.27).
Is the point of intersection exactly (−0.45, 0.27)? (Substitute these values into the
equations to ﬁnd out.) In fact, it is impossible to ﬁnd the exact solution of this system
graphically, but we now have a ballpark answer that we can use to help check the
following algebraic solution.

2.1 Systems of Two Equations in Two Unknowns
117
Method 2: Algebraic We ﬁrst see that adding the equations is not going to eliminate
either x or y. Notice, however, that if we multiply (both sides of) the ﬁrst equation by 2
and the second by −3, the coefﬁcients of x will become 6 and −6. Then if we add them,
x will be eliminated. So we proceed as follows:
2(3x + 5y) = 2(0)
−3(2x + 7y) = −3(1)
gives
6x + 10y = 0
−6x −21y = −3
Adding these equations we get
−11y = −3
so that
y = 3

= (−0.45, 0.27).
Notice that the algebraic method gives us the exact solution that we could not ﬁnd
with the graphical method. Still, we can check that the graph and our algebraic solution
agree to the accuracy with which we can read the graph. To be absolutely sure that our
answer is correct we should check it:

+Before we go on...
Q: In solving the system in Example 2 algebraically, we multiplied (both sides of) the equations
by numbers. How does that affect their graphs?
A: Since multiplying both sides of an equation by a nonzero number has no effect on its solu-
tions, the graph (which represents the set of all solutions) is unchanged. ■

Graphical Method for Solving a System of Two Equations 
in Two Unknowns
Graph both equations on the same graph. (For example, solve each for y to ﬁnd the slope
and y-intercept.) A point of intersection gives the solution to the system. To ﬁnd the
point, you may need to adjust the range of x-values you use. To ﬁnd the point accurately
you may need to use a smaller range (or zoom in if using technology).
Algebraic Method for Solving a System of Two Equations 
in Two Unknowns
Multiply each equation by a nonzero number so that the coefﬁcients of x are the same in
absolute value but opposite in sign. Add the two equations to eliminate x; this gives an
equation in y that we can solve to ﬁnd its value. Substitute this value of y into one of the
original equations to ﬁnd the value of x. (Note that we could eliminate y ﬁrst instead of
x if it’s more convenient.)
Sometimes, something appears to go wrong with these methods. The following
examples show what can happen.

Example 3 Inconsistent System
Solve the system
x −3y = 5
−2x + 6y = 8
Solution To eliminate x, we multiply the ﬁrst equation by 2 and then add:
2x −6y = 10
−2x + 6y = 8
Adding gives
0 = 18
But this is absurd! This calculation shows that if we had two numbers x and y that satis-
ﬁed both equations, it would be true that 0 = 18. Since 0 is not equal to 18, there can be
no such numbers x and y. In other words, the system has no solutions, and is called an
inconsistent system.
In slope-intercept form these lines are y = 1
3x −5
3 and y = 1
3x + 4
3. Notice that
they have the same slope but different y-intercepts. This means that they are parallel, but
different lines. Plotting them conﬁrms this fact (Figure 4).
Since they are parallel, they do not intersect. Since a solution must be a point of
intersection, we again conclude that there is no solution.
Before doing some more examples, let’s summarize what we’ve said about solving
systems of equations.

2.1 Systems of Two Equations in Two Unknowns
119
Example 4 Redundant System
Solve the system
x + y = 2
2x + 2y = 4
Solution Multiplying the ﬁrst equation by −2 gives
−2x −2y = −4
2x + 2y = 4
Adding gives the not-very-enlightening result
0 = 0
Now what has happened? Looking back at the original system, we note that the second
equation is really the ﬁrst equation in disguise (it is the ﬁrst equation multiplied by 2).
Put another way, if we solve both equations for y, we ﬁnd that, in slope-intercept form,
both equations become the same:
y = −x + 2
Since the second equation gives us the same information as the ﬁrst, we say that this is
a redundant, or dependent system. In other words, we really have only one equation in
two unknowns. From Chapter 1, we know that a single linear equation in two unknowns
has inﬁnitely many solutions, one for each value of x. (Recall that to get the corre-
sponding solution for y, we solve the equation for y and substitute the x-value.) The
entire set of solutions can be summarized as follows:
x is arbitrary
y = 2 −x
Solve the ﬁrst equation for y.
This set of solutions is called the general solution because it includes all possible
solutions. When we write the general solution this way, we say that we have a para-
meterized solution and that x is the parameter.
We can also write the general solution as
(x, 2 −x)
x arbitrary
Different choices of the parameter x lead to different particular solutions. For instance,
choosing x = 3 gives the particular solution
(x, y) = (3, −1)
Because there are inﬁnitely many values of x from which to choose, there are inﬁnitely
many solutions.
What does this system of equations look like graphically? Since the two equations
are really the same, their graphs are identical, each being the line with x-intercept 2
and y-intercept 2. The “two” lines intersect at every point, so there is a solution for
each point on the common line. In other words, we have a “whole line of solutions”
(Figure 5).
We could also have solved the ﬁrst equation for x instead and used y as a parameter,
obtaining another form of the general solution:
(2 −y, y)
y arbitrary

Applications
Possible Outcomes for a System of Two Linear Equations 
in Two Unknowns
1. A single (or unique) solution This happens when the lines corresponding to the two
equations are distinct and not parallel so that they intersect at a single point. (See
Example 1.)
2. No solution This happens when the two lines are parallel. We say that the system is
inconsistent. (See Example 3.)
3. An inﬁnite number of solutions This occurs when the two equations represent the
same straight line, and we say that such a system is redundant, or dependent. In this
case, we can represent the solutions by choosing one variable arbitrarily and solving
for the other. (See Example 4.)
In cases 1 and 3, we say that the system of equations is consistent because it has at least
one solution.
We summarize the three possible outcomes we have encountered.
Example 5 Blending
Acme Baby Foods mixes two strengths of apple juice. One quart of Beginner’s juice is
made from 30 ﬂuid ounces of water and 2 ﬂuid ounces of apple juice concentrate. One
quart of Advanced juice is made from 20 ﬂuid ounces of water and 12 ﬂuid ounces of
concentrate. Every day Acme has available 30,000 ﬂuid ounces of water and 3600 ﬂuid
ounces of concentrate. If the company wants to use all the water and concentrate, how
many quarts of each type of juice should it mix?
Solution In all applications we follow the same general strategy.
1. Identify and label the unknowns. What are we asked to ﬁnd? To answer this question,
it is common to respond by saying, “The unknowns are Beginner’s juice and
Advanced juice.” Quite frankly, this is a bafﬂing statement. Just what is unknown
about juice? We need to be more precise:
The unknowns are (1) the number of quarts of Beginner’s juice and (2) the number
of quarts of Advanced juice made each day.
So, we label the unknowns as follows: Let
x = number of quarts of Beginner’s juice made each day
y = number of quarts of Advanced juice made each day
2. Use the information given to set up equations in the unknowns. This step is trickier,
and the strategy varies from problem to problem. Here, the amount of juice the com-
pany can make is constrained by the fact that they have limited amounts of water and
concentrate. This example shows a kind of application we will often see, and it is
helpful in these problems to use a table to record the amounts of the resources used.

Advanced (y)
Available
Water (fl oz)
30

30,000
Concentrate (fl oz)

12
3600
We can now set up an equation for each of the items listed on the left.
Water: We read across the ﬁrst row. If Acme mixes x quarts of Beginner’s juice, each quart
using 30 ﬂuid ounces of water, and y quarts of Advanced juice, each using 20 ﬂuid ounces
of water, it will use a total of 30x + 20y ﬂuid ounces of water. But we are told that the total
has to be 30,000 ﬂuid ounces. Thus, 30x + 20y = 30,000. This is our ﬁrst equation.
Concentrate: We read across the second row. If Acme mixes x quarts of Beginner’s juice,
each using 2 ﬂuid ounces of concentrate, and y quarts of Advanced juice, each using 12
ﬂuid ounces of concentrate, it will use a total of 2x + 12y ﬂuid ounces of concentrate.
But we are told that the total has to be 3600 ﬂuid ounces. Thus, 2x + 12y = 3600.
Now we have two equations:
30x + 20y = 30,000
2x + 12y = 3600
To make the numbers easier to work with, let’s divide (both sides of) the ﬁrst equation
by 10 and the second by 2:
3x + 2y = 3000
x + 6y = 1800
We can now eliminate x by multiplying the second equation by −3 and adding:
3x + 2y = 3000
−3x −18y = −5400
−16y = −2400
So, y = 2400/16 = 150. Substituting this into the equation x + 6y = 1800 gives
x + 900 = 1800, and so x = 900.The solution is (x, y) = (900, 150). In other words, the
company should mix 900 quarts of Beginner’s juice and 150 quarts of Advanced juice.
Example 6 Blending
A medieval alchemist’s love potion calls for a number of eyes of newt and toes of frog,
the total being 20, but with twice as many newt eyes as frog toes. How many of each is
required?
Solution As in the preceding example, the ﬁrst step is to identify and label the
unknowns. Let
x = number of newt eyes
y = number of frog toes
As for the second step—setting up the equations—a table is less appropriate here than
in the preceding example. Instead, we translate each phrase of the problem into an equa-
tion. The ﬁrst sentence tells us that the total number of eyes and toes is 20. Thus,
x + y = 20
AKG, Berlin/SuperStock

122
Chapter 2
Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices
The end of the ﬁrst sentence gives us more information, but the phrase “twice as many
newt eyes as frog toes” is a little tricky: does it mean that 2x = y or that x = 2y? We can
decide which by rewording the statement using the phrases “the number of newt eyes,”
which is x, and “the number of frog toes,” which is y. Rephrased, the statement reads:
The number of newt eyes is twice the number of frog toes.
(Notice how the word “twice” is forced into a different place.) With this rephrasing, we
can translate directly into algebra:
x = 2y
In standard form (ax + by = c), this equation reads
x −2y = 0
Thus, we have the two equations:
x + y = 20
x −2y = 0
To eliminate x, we multiply the second equation by −1 and then add:
x + y = 20
−x + 2y = 0
We’ll leave it to you to ﬁnish solving the system and ﬁnd that x = 13 1
3 and y = 6 2
3 .
So, the recipe calls for exactly 13 1
3 eyes of newt and 6 2
3 toes of frog. The
alchemist needs a very sharp scalpel and a very accurate balance (not to mention a
very strong stomach).
We saw in Chapter 1 that the equilibrium price of an item (the price at which sup-
ply equals demand) and the break-even point (the number of items that must be sold to
break even) can both be described as the intersection points of two lines. In terms of the
language of this chapter, what we were really doing was solving a system of two linear
equations in two unknowns, as illustrated in the following problem.
Example 7 Equilibrium Price
The demand for refrigerators in West Podunk is given by
q = −p
10 + 100
where q is the number of refrigerators that the citizens will buy each year if the refrig-
erators are priced at p dollars each. The supply is
q = p
20 + 25
where now q is the number of refrigerators the manufacturers will be willing to ship into
town each year if they are priced at p dollars each. Find the equilibrium price and the
number of refrigerators that will be sold at that price.
Solution Figure 6 shows the demand and supply curves. The equilibrium price occurs
at the point where these two lines cross, which is where demand equals supply.

The graph suggests that the equilibrium price is $500, and zooming in conﬁrms this.
To solve this system algebraically, ﬁrst write both equations in standard form:
p
10 + q = 100
−p
20 + q = 25
We can clear fractions and also prepare to eliminate p if we multiply the ﬁrst equation
by 10 and the second by 20:
p + 10q = 1000
−p + 20q = 500
and so:
30q = 1500
q = 50
Substituting this value of q into either equation gives us p = 500. Thus, the equilibrium
price is $500, and 50 refrigerators will be sold at this price.
We could also have solved this system of equations by setting the two expressions
for q (the supply and the demand) equal to each other:
−p/10 + 100 = p/20 + 25
and then solving for p. (See the Before we go on discussion at the end of Example 1.)

FAQs
Setting Up the Equations
Q: Looking through these examples, I notice that in some, we can tabulate the information
given and read off the equations (as in Example 5), whereas in others (like Example 6), we have
to reword each sentence to turn it into an equation. How do I know what approach to use?
A: There is no hard-and-fast rule, and indeed some applications might call for a bit of each
approach. However, it is generally not hard to see when it would be useful to tabulate values:
Lists of the numbers of ingredients or components generally lend themselves to tabulation,
whereas phrases like “twice as many of these as those” generally require direct translation
into equations (after rewording if necessary). ■

Using Matrices to Solve Systems 
of Equations
In this section we describe a systematic method for solving systems of equations that
makes solving large systems of equations straightforward. Although this method may
seem a little cumbersome at ﬁrst, it will prove immensely useful in this and the next
several chapters.
First of all, notice that a linear equation (for example, 2x −y = 3) is entirely
determined by its coefﬁcients (here, the numbers 2 and 1) and its constant term or
right-hand side (here, 3). In other words, if we were simply given the row of numbers
[2
1
3]
we could easily reconstruct the original linear equation by multiplying the ﬁrst number
by x, the second by y, and inserting a plus sign and an equals sign, as follows:
2 · x + (−1) · y = 3
or
2x −y = 3
Similarly, the equation
−4x + 2y = 0
is represented by the row
[4
2
0]
and the equation
−3y = 1
4

is represented by

0
−3
1
4

As the last example shows, the ﬁrst number is always the coefﬁcient of x and the second
is the coefﬁcient of y. If an x or a y is missing, we write a zero for its coefﬁcient. We shall
call such a row the coefﬁcient row of an equation.
If we have a system of equations, for example the system
2x −
y = 3
−x + 2y = −4
we can put the coefﬁcient rows together like this:

2
−1
3
−1
2
−4

We call this the augmented matrix of the system of equations. The term augmented
means that we have included the right-hand sides 3 and 4. We will often drop the word
augmented and simply refer to the matrix of the system. A matrix (plural: matrices) is
nothing more than a rectangular array of numbers as above.
128
Chapter 2
Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices
Matrix
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers.
quick Example
We’ll be studying matrices in their own right more carefully in Chapter 3.
Q: What good are coefficient rows and matrices?
A: Think about what we do when we multiply both sides of an equation by a number. For
example, consider multiplying both sides of the equation 2x −y = 3 by −2 to get
−4x + 2y = −6. All we are really doing is multiplying the coefficients and the right-hand side
by −2. This corresponds to multiplying the row [2 −1 3] by −2, that is, multiplying every
number in the row by −2. We shall see that any manipulation we want to do with equations can
be done instead with rows, and this fact leads to a method of solving equations that is
systematic and generalizes easily to larger systems. ■
Augmented Matrix
The augmented matrix of a system of linear equations is the matrix whose rows are the
coefﬁcient rows of the equations.
The augmented matrix of the system
x + y = 3
x −y = 1
is




Here is the same operation both in the language of equations and the language of
rows. (We refer to the equation here as Equation 1, or simply E1 for short, and to the row
as Row 1, or R1.)
2.2 Using Matrices to Solve Systems of Equations
129

E1: 2x −y = 3

R2
Add:
E1 + E2:
x + y = −1
[
1 
1 1]
R1 + R2
Multiplying both sides of an equation by the number a corresponds to multiplying
the coefﬁcient row by a.
Now look at what we do when we add two equations:
All we are really doing is adding the corresponding entries in the rows, or adding the
rows. In other words,
Adding two equations corresponds to adding their coefﬁcient rows.
In short, the manipulations of equations that we saw in the preceding section can be
done more easily with rows in a matrix, since we don’t have to carry x, y, and other un-
necessary notation along with us; x and y can always be inserted at the end if desired.
The manipulations we are talking about are known as row operations. In particular,
we use three elementary row operations.
Elementary Row Operations*
Type 1: Replacing Ri by aRi (where a ̸= 0)†
In words: multiplying or dividing a row by a nonzero number.
Type 2: Replacing Ri by aRi ± bRj (where a ̸= 0)
Multiplying a row by a nonzero number and adding or subtracting a multiple of another
row.
Type 3: Switching the order of the rows
This corresponds to switching the order in which we write the equations; occasionally
this will be convenient.
* We are using the term elementary row operations a little more freely than most books. Some mathematicians
insist that a = 1 in an operation of Type 2, but the less restrictive version is very useful.
† Multiplying an equation or row by zero gives us the not very surprising result 0 = 0. In fact, we lose any
information that that equation provided, which usually means that the resulting system has more solutions than
the original system.
Equation
Row
E1:
2x −y = 3
[ 2

3]
R1
Multiply by −2 :
(−2)E1: −4x + 2y = −6
[−4
2 −6]
(−2)R1

One very important fact about the elementary row operations is that they do not change
the solutions of the corresponding system of equations. In other words, the new system
of equations that we get by applying any one of these operations will have exactly the
same solutions as the original system: It is easy to see that numbers that make the
original equations true will also make the new equations true, because each of the ele-
mentary row operations corresponds to a valid operation on the original equations. That
any solution of the new system is a solution of the old system follows from the fact that
these row operations are reversible: The effects of a row operation can be reversed by
applying another row operation, called its inverse. Here are some examples of this
reversibility. (Try them out in the above Quick Examples.)

how to do row operations using
a TI-83/84 or Excel.
Our objective, then, is to use row operations to change the system we are given into
one with exactly the same set of solutions, in which it is easy to see what the solutions are.
Solving Systems of Equations Using Row Operations
Now we put rows to work for us in solving systems of equations. Let’s start with a com-
plicated looking system of equations:
−2x
3 + y
2 = −3
x
4 −y = 11

We begin by writing the matrix of the system:

−2
3

2
−3

4
−1
11


Now what do we do with this matrix? 
For Types 1 and 2, we write the instruction for the row operation next to the row we wish
to replace (see the quick examples below).
Type 1:

Step 1 Clear the fractions and/or decimals (if any) using operations of Type 1. To
clear the fractions, we multiply the ﬁrst row by 6 and the second row by 4. We record the
operations by writing the symbolic form of an operation next to the row it will change,
as follows.

−2
3
1
2
−3
1
4
−1
11

6R1

By this we mean that we will replace the ﬁrst row by 6R1 and the second by 4R2. Doing
these operations gives

−4

−18
1
−4
11

Step 2 Designate the ﬁrst nonzero entry in the ﬁrst row as the pivot. In this case we
designate the entry −4 in the ﬁrst row as the “pivot” by putting a box around it:


Pivot column
Q: What is a “pivot”?
A: A pivot is an entry in a matrix that is used to “clear a column” (see Step 3). In this proce-
dure, we will always select the first nonzero entry of a row as our pivot. In Chapter 4, when we
study the simplex method, we will select our pivots differently. ■
Step 3 Use the pivot to clear its column using operations of Type 2. By clearing a
column, we mean changing the matrix so that the pivot is the only nonzero number in
its column. The procedure of clearing a column using a designated pivot is also called
pivoting.

Cleared pivot column
We want to replace R2 by a row of the form aR2 ± bR1 to get a zero in column 1.
Moreover—and this will be important when we discuss the simplex method in Chap-
ter 4—we are going to choose positive values for both a and b.12 We need to choose
a and b so that we get the desired cancellation. We can do this quite mechanically as
follows:
a. Write the name of the row you need to change on the left and that of the pivot row on
the right.

aR2 ± bR1.

b. Focus on the pivot column, 


. Multiply each row by the absolute value of the
entry currently in the other (we are not permitting a or b to be negative).

The effect is to make the two entries in the pivot column numerically the same.
Sometimes, you can accomplish this by using smaller values of a and b.
c. If the entries in the pivot column have opposite signs, insert a plus (+). If they have
the same sign, insert a minus (−). Here, we get the instruction
4R2 + 1R1
d. Write the operation next to the row you want to change, and then replace that row
using the operation:

We have cleared the pivot column and completed Step 3. 
Note In general, the row operation you use should always have the following form:13

with a and b both positive.
The next step is one that can be performed at any time. ■
Simplification Step (Optional) If, at any stage of the process, all the numbers in
a row are multiples of an integer, divide by that integer—a Type 1 operation.
This is an optional but extremely helpful step: It makes the numbers smaller and
easier to work with. In our case, the entries in R2 are divisible by 13, so we divide that
row by 13. (Alternatively, we could divide by −13. Try it.)

the column (pivoting). The pivot is shown below, as well as the desired result when the
column has been cleared:

Chapter 2
Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices
13 We are deviating somewhat from the traditional procedure here. It is traditionally recommended ﬁrst to
divide the pivot row by the pivot, turning the pivot into a 1. This allows us to always use a = 1. The procedure
we use here is easier for hand calculations since it avoids the use of fractions. See the end of this section for
an example using the traditional procedure.

We now wish to get a 0 in place of the 3 in the pivot column. Let’s run once again
through the mechanical steps to get the row operation that accomplishes this.
a. Write the name of the row you need to change on the left and that of the pivot row on
the right:
R1
R2

↑

b. Focus on the pivot column,

c. If the entries in the pivot column have opposite signs, insert a plus (+). If they have
the same sign, insert a minus (−). Here, we get the instruction
1R1 + 3R2
d. Write the operation next to the row you want to change and then replace that row
using the operation.

Now we are essentially done, except for one last step.
Final Step Using operations of Type 1, turn each pivot (the ﬁrst nonzero entry in
each row) into a 1. We can accomplish this by dividing the ﬁrst row by −4 and multi-
plying the second row by −1:

−4

The matrix now has the following nice form:

1
0
#
0
1
#

(This is the form we will always obtain with two equations in two unknowns when there
is a unique solution.) This form is nice because, when we translate back into equations,
we get
1x + 0y = 3
0x + 1y = −2
In other words,
x = 3
and
y = −2
and so we have found the solution, which we can also write as (x, y) = (3, −2). 
2.2 Using Matrices to Solve Systems of Equations
133

The procedure we’ve just demonstrated is called Gauss-Jordan14 reduction or row
reduction. It may seem too complicated a way to solve a system of two equations in two
unknowns, and it is. However, for systems with more equations and more unknowns, it
is very efﬁcient. 
In Example 1 below we use row reduction to solve a system of linear equations in
three unknowns: x, y, and z. Just as for a system in two unknowns, a solution of a system
in any number of unknowns consists of values for each of the variables that, when substi-
tuted, satisfy all of the equations in the system.Again just as for a system in two unknowns,
any system of linear equations in any number of unknowns has either no solution, exactly
one solution, or inﬁnitely many solutions. There are no other possibilities.
Solving a system in three unknowns graphically would require the graphing of
planes (ﬂat surfaces) in three dimensions. (The graph of a linear equation in three un-
knowns is a ﬂat surface.) The use of row reduction makes three-dimensional graphing
unnecessary.

Chapter 2
Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices
14 Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was one of the great mathematicians, making fundamental contributions
to number theory, analysis, probability and statistics, as well as many ﬁelds of science. He developed a method
of solving systems of linear equations by row reduction, which was then reﬁned by Wilhelm Jordan
(1842–1899) into the form we are showing you here.
Example 1 Solving a System by Gauss-Jordan Reduction
Solve the system
x −y + 5z = −6
3x + 3y −z = 10
x + 3y + 2z = 5



Note that the columns correspond to x, y, z, and the right-hand side, respectively. We
begin by selecting the pivot in the ﬁrst row and clearing its column. Remember that
clearing the column means that we turn all other numbers in the column into zeros.
Thus, to clear the column of the ﬁrst pivot, we need to change two rows, setting up the
row operations in exactly the same way as above.

The matrix is now reduced to a simple form, so we translate back into equations to ob-
tain the solution:
x = 1, y = 2, z = −1, or (x, y, z) = (1, 2, −1)
Notice the form of the very last matrix in the example:

The 1s are on the (main) diagonal of the matrix; the goal in Gauss-Jordan reduction is
to reduce our matrix to this form. If we can do so, then we can easily read off the solu-
tion, as we saw in Example 1. However, as we will see in several examples in this sec-
tion, it is not always possible to achieve this ideal state. After Example 6, we will give a
form that is always possible to achieve.

Now we have a slight problem: The number in the position where we would like to have

There are two ways out of this problem. One is to move on to the third column and pivot
on the −2. Another is to switch the order of the second and third rows so that we can use
the 3 as a pivot. We will do the latter.

Stop. That last row translates into 0 = 1, which is nonsense, and so, as in Example 3 in
Section 2.1, we can say that this system has no solution. We also say, as we did for
systems with only two unknowns, that a system with no solution is inconsistent. A
system with at least one solution is consistent.
+Before we go on...
Q: How, exactly, does the nonsensical equation 0 = 1 tell us that there is no solution of the 
system in Example 3?
A: Here is an argument similar to that in Example 3 in Section 2.1: If there were three num-
bers x, y, and z satisfying the original system of equations, then manipulating the equations 
according to the instructions in the row operations above leads us to conclude that 0 = 1. Since
0 is not equal to 1, there can be no such numbers x, y, and z. ■

Q: How do we know when there are have infinitely many solutions?
A: When there are solutions (we have a consistent system, unlike the one in Example 3), and
when the matrix we arrive at by row reduction has fewer pivots than there are unknowns. In
Example 4 we had three unknowns but only two pivots.
Q: How do we know which variables to use as parameters in a parameterized solution?
A: The variables to use as parameters are those in the columns without pivots. In Example 4
there were pivots in the x and y columns, but no pivot in the z column, and it was z that we used
as a parameter. ■

But how does this help us ﬁnd a solution? The last equation doesn’t tell us anything use-
ful, so we ignore it. The thing to notice about the other equations is that we can easily
solve the ﬁrst equation for x and the second for y, obtaining
x = 2
3 −5
3z
y = 1
3 + 2
3z
This is the solution! We can choose z to be any number and get corresponding values for
x and y from the formulas above. This gives us inﬁnitely many different solutions. Thus,
the general solution (see Example 4 in Section 2.1) is
x = 2

y = 1
3 + 2

z is arbitrary
We can also write the general solution as
 2
3 −5
3z, 1

General solution
This general solution has z as the parameter. Speciﬁc choices of values for the para-
meter z give particular solutions. For example, the choice z = 6 gives the particular
solution
x = 2
3 −5
3(6) = −28
3
y = 1
3 + 2
3(6) = 13

z = 6
while the choice z = 0 gives the particular solution (x, y, z) =
 2
3, 1


.
Note that, unlike the system given in preceding example, the system given in this
example does have solutions, and is thus consistent.
+Before we go on... Why were there inﬁnitely many solutions to Example 4? The reason
is that the third equation was really a combination of the ﬁrst and second equations to
begin with, so we effectively had only two equations in three unknowns.15 Choosing a
speciﬁc value for z (say, z = 6) has the effect of supplying the “missing” equation.
15 In fact, you can check that the third equation, E3, is equal to 3E1 −8E2. Thus, the third equation could have
been left out, since it conveys no more information than the ﬁrst two. The process of row reduction always
eliminates such a redundancy by creating a row of zeros.

Translating back into equations, we get:
x + 3y −6w = 2
z + 5
2w = 2
(We have not written down the equations corresponding to the last two rows, each of
which is 0 = 0.) Since there are no pivots in the y or w columns, we use these two vari-
ables as parameters. We bring them over to the right-hand sides of the equations above
and write the general solution as
x = 2 −3y + 6w
y is arbitrary
z = 2 −5
2w
w is arbitrary
or
(x, y, z, w) = (2 −3y + 6w, y, 2 −5w/2, w) y, w arbitrary
As in Example 4, you can check that the general solution is correct by substituting back
into the original equations. (Since y and w are arbitrary, substitute nothing for them, but
check that, as in Example 4, they cancel out when we substitute the formulas for x and z.)
+Before we go on... In Examples 4 and 5, you might have noticed an interesting
phenomenon: If at any time in the process, two rows are equal or one is a multiple of the
other, then one of those rows (eventually) becomes all zero. ■

If, instead of a row of zeros, we had obtained, say, [0  0  6] in the last row, we would
immediately have concluded that the system was inconsistent.
The fact that we wound up with a row of zeros indicates that one of the equations
was actually a combination of the other two; you can check that the third equation can
be obtained by multiplying the ﬁrst equation by 13 and adding the result to the second.
Since the third equation therefore tells us nothing that we don’t already know from
the ﬁrst two, we call the system of equations redundant, or dependent (compare
Example 4 in Section 2.1).
+Before we go on... If you now take another look at Example 5, you will ﬁnd that 
we could have started with the following smaller system of two equations in four 
unknowns
x + 3y + 2z −w = 6
2x + 6y + 6z + 3w = 16
and obtained the same general solution as we did with the larger system. Verify this by
solving the smaller system. ■
Up to this point, we have always been given as many equations as there are un-
knowns. However, we shall see in the next section that some applications lead to sys-
tems where the number of equations is not the same as the number of unknowns. As
the following example illustrates, such systems can be handled the same way as any
other.

The preceding examples illustrated that we cannot always reduce a matrix to the
form shown before Example 2, with pivots going all the way down the diagonal. What
we can always do is reduce a matrix to the following form:
2.2 Using Matrices to Solve Systems of Equations
141
quick Examples
You should check in the examples we did that the ﬁnal matrices were all in reduced
row echelon form.
It is an interesting and useful fact, though not easy to prove, that any two people
who start with the same matrix and row-reduce it will reach exactly the same row-
reduced matrix, even if they use different row operations.
The Traditional Gauss-Jordan Method (Optional)
In the version of the Gauss-Jordan method we have presented, we eliminated fractions
and decimals in the ﬁrst step and then worked with integer matrices, partly to make hand
computation easier and partly for mathematical elegance. However, complicated 
fractions and decimals present no difﬁculty when we use technology. The following
example illustrates the more traditional approach to Gauss-Jordan reduction used in
many of the computer programs that solve the huge systems of equations that arise in
practice.16
16 Actually, for reasons of efﬁciency and accuracy, the methods used in commercial programs are close to, but
not exactly, the method presented here. To learn more, consult a text on numerical methods.
Reduced Row Echelon Form
A matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form or to be row-reduced if it satisﬁes
the following properties.
P1. The ﬁrst nonzero entry in each row (called the leading entry of that row) is a 1.
P2. The columns of the leading entries are clear (i.e., they contain zeros in all positions
other than that of the leading entry).
P3. The leading entry in each row is to the right of the leading entry in the row above,
and any rows of zeros are at the bottom.

Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices
Solution We make two changes in our method. First, there is no need to get rid of
decimals (since computers and calculators can handle decimals as easily as they can
integers). Second, after selecting a pivot, divide the pivot row by the pivot value, turning
the pivot into a 1. It is easier to determine the row operations that will clear the pivot
column if the pivot is a 1.

FAQs
Getting Unstuck, Going Round in Circles, and Knowing 
When to Stop
Q: Help! I have been doing row operations on this matrix for half an hour. I have filled two
pages, and I am getting nowhere. What do I do?
A: Here is a way of keeping track of where you are at any stage of the process and also
deciding what to do next.
Starting at the top row of your current matrix:
1. Scan along the row until you get to the leading entry: the first nonzero entry. If there is
none—that is, the row is all zero—go to the next row.
2. Having located the leading entry, scan up and down its column. If its column is not clear
(that is, it contains other nonzero entries), use your leading entry as a pivot to clear its col-
umn as in the examples in this section.
3. Now go to the next row and start again at Step 1.
Q: The solution to Example 7 looked quite easy. Why didn’t we use the traditional method from
the start?
A: It looked easy because we deliberately chose an example with simple numbers. In all but
the most contrived examples, the decimals or fractions involved get very complicated very
quickly.

2.2 Using Matrices to Solve Systems of Equations
143
When you have scanned all the rows and find that all the columns of the leading entries are
clear, it means you are done (except possibly for reordering the rows so that the leading entries
go from left to right as you read down the matrix, and zero rows are at the bottom). ■
Q: No good. I have been following these instructions, but every time I try to clear a column, I
unclear a column I had already cleared. What is going on?
A: Are you using leading entries as pivots? Also, are you using the pivot to clear its column?
That is, are your row operations all of the following form?
aRc ± bRp
↑
↑
Row to change
Pivot row
The instruction next to the row you are changing should involve only that row and the pivot row,
even though you might be tempted to use some other row instead. 
Q: Must I continue until I get a matrix that has 1s down the leading diagonal and 0s above and
below?
A: Not necessarily. You are completely done when your matrix is row-reduced: each leading
entry is a 1, the column of each leading entry is clear, and the leading entries go from left to
right. You are done pivoting when the column of each leading entry is clear. After that, all that
remains is to turn each pivot into a 1 (the "Final Step") and, if necessary, rearrange the rows. ■

2.3 Applications of Systems of Linear Equations
In the examples and the exercises of this section, we consider scenarios that lead to sys-
tems of linear equations in three or more unknowns. Some of these applications will
strike you as a little idealized or even contrived compared with the kinds of problems

Example 1 Blending
The Arctic Juice Company makes three juice blends: PineOrange, using 2 quarts of
pineapple juice and 2 quarts of orange juice per gallon; PineKiwi, using 3 quarts of
pineapple juice and 1 quart of kiwi juice per gallon; and OrangeKiwi, using 3 quarts 
of orange juice and 1 quart of kiwi juice per gallon. Each day the company has 800 quarts
of pineapple juice, 650 quarts of orange juice, and 350 quarts of kiwi juice available.
How many gallons of each blend should it make each day if it wants to use up all of the
supplies?

you might encounter in the real world.17 One reason is that we will not have tools to han-
dle more realistic versions of these applications until we have studied linear program-
ming in Chapter 4.
In each example that follows, we set up the problem as a linear system and then
give the solution. For practice, you should do the row reduction necessary to get the
solution.
Delaware Valley Grantmakers
(DVG) is the regional associate of
grantmakers in the Philadelphia
area. As a professional associa-
tion for people, organizations and
businesses that make charitable
grants in Greater Philadelphia
and neighboring regions, our mis-
sion is to promote and enhance
regional philanthropy by providing our members with oppor-
tunities for networking, knowledge sharing, and professional
development that add critical value to their work.
As the Director of Programs and Member Services I
focus on planning and implementing approximately 40 educa-
tional programs annually including a full-day conference for
both grantmakers and nonprofit organizations, as well as
overseeing all member recruitment and retention activities.
DVG has a membership of over 150 organizations and 600 in-
dividuals within those organizations. In my capacity I need to
provide those individuals and organizations with information
they can use to be more effective in their grantmaking dollars
which fund the arts, health programs, the environment, com-
munity development, etc.
From the outside, it wouldn’t necessarily seem as if math
would be a necessity for someone in my position at an orga-
nization like DVG. However, I quickly learned that there is
virtually no job that doesn’t include using math. In fact I have
always been someone who was intimidated by math and pur-
sued a career which wouldn’t require applying it everyday!
But as a nonprofit organization, we need to understand,
manage, and most importantly stretch a small budget.
Whether planning a daylong conference, publishing a quar-
terly newsletter, or implementing a grant-funded project—an
understanding of multiple budgets as part of a bigger whole is
crucial.
For example, throughout the course of a fiscal year, I
need to assess my budget and make decisions about manag-
ing money for various programs. During our annual confer-
ence (which is the most costly event that we run throughout
the year) we set a budget ahead of time but unforeseen costs
always arise. Consequently, there needs to be consistent

+Before we go on...
Caution
We do not recommend relying on the coincidence that the table we created to organize
the information in Example 1 happened to be the matrix of the system; it is too easy to
set up the table “sideways” and get the wrong matrix. You should always write down the
system of equations and be sure you understand each equation. For example, the equa-
tion 2x + 3y = 800 in Example 1 indicates that the number of quarts of pineapple juice
that will be used (2x + 3y) is equal to the amount available (800 quarts). By thinking of
the reason for each equation, you can check that you have the correct system. If you have
the wrong system of equations to begin with, solving it won’t help you. ■
Q: Just how realistic is the scenario in Example 1?
A: This is a very unrealistic scenario, for several reasons:
1. Isn’t it odd that we happened to end up with exactly the same number of equations as un-
knowns? Real scenarios are rarely so considerate. If there had been four equations, there
Solution We take the same steps to understand the problem that we took in Sec-
tion 2.1. The ﬁrst step is to identify and label the unknowns. Looking at the question
asked in the last sentence, we see that we should label the unknowns like this:
x = number of gallons of PineOrange made each day
y = number of gallons of PineKiwi made each day
z = number of gallons of OrangeKiwi made each day
Next, we can organize the information we are given in a table:
PineOrange (x)
PineKiwi (y)
OrangeKiwi (z)
Total Available
Pineapple Juice (qt)
2
3
0
800
Orange Juice (qt)
2
0
3
650
Kiwi Juice (qt)
0
1
1
350
Notice how we have arranged the table; we have placed headings corresponding to the
unknowns along the top, rather than down the side, and we have added a heading for
the available totals. This gives us a table that is essentially the matrix of the system of
linear equations we are looking for. (However, read the caution in the Before we go 
on . . . section.)
Now we read across each row of the table. The fact that we want to use exactly the
amount of each juice that is available leads to the following three equations:
2x + 3y
= 800
2x
+ 3z = 650
y + z = 350
The solution of this system is (x, y, z) = (100, 200, 150), so Arctic Juice should make
100 gallons of PineOrange, 200 gallons of PineKiwi, and 150 gallons of OrangeKiwi
each day.

would in all likelihood have been no solution at all. However, we need to understand these 
idealized problems before we can tackle the real world.
2. Even if a real-world scenario does give the same number of equations as unknowns, there is
still no guarantee that there will be a unique solution consisting of positive values. What, for
instance, would we have done in this example if x had turned out to be negative?
3. The requirement that we use exactly all the ingredients would be an unreasonable constraint
in real life. When we discuss linear programming, we will be able to substitute the more rea-
sonable constraint that you use no more than is available, and we will add the more reason-
able objective that you maximize profit. ■

Reading across, we get the equations expressing the facts that the airline needs to seat

400x + 300y + 300z = 3200
200x + 160y + 120z = 1600
There is an additional piece of information we have not yet used: the airline wishes to
purchase three times as many 777s as 747s. As we said in Section 2.1, it is easiest to
translate a statement like this into an equation if we ﬁrst reword it using the phrase “the
number of.” Thus, we say: “The number of 777s ordered is three times the number of
747s ordered,” or
y = 3x

found at the companies’websites and in an August 2002 press release announcing a Deutsche Lufthansa order
for ten A330-300s to be delivered in 2004–2005.
Example 2 Aircraft Purchasing
An airline is considering the purchase of aircraft to meet an estimated demand for 3200
seats. The airline has decided to buy Boeing 747s, which seat 400 passengers and are
priced at $200 million each; Boeing 777s, which seat 300 passengers and are priced at
$160 million; and Airbus A330s, which seat 300 passengers and are priced at $120 mil-
lion.* Assuming that the airline wishes to buy three times as many 777s as 747s, how
many of each should it order to meet the demand for seats, given a $1600 million spend-
ing target?
Solution We label the unknowns as follows:
x = number of 747s ordered from Boeing
y = number of 777s ordered from Boeing
z = number of A330s ordered from Airbus
We must now set up the equations. We can organize some (but not all) of the given in-
formation in a table:

Example 3 Traffic Flow
Trafﬁc through downtown Urbanville ﬂows through the one-way system shown in
Figure 7.
Trafﬁc counting devices installed in the road (shown as boxes) count 200 cars en-
tering town from the west each hour, 150 leaving town on the north each hour, and 50
leaving town on the south each hour.
a. From this information, is it possible to determine how many cars drive along Allen,
Baker, and Coal streets every hour?
b. What is the maximum possible trafﬁc ﬂow along Baker Street?
c. What is the minimum possible trafﬁc along Allen Street?
d. What is the maximum possible trafﬁc ﬂow along Coal Street?
Solution
a. Our unknowns are:
x = number of cars per hour on Allen Street
y = number of cars per hour on Baker Street
z = number of cars per hour on Coal Street
Assuming that, at each intersection, cars do not fall into a pit or materialize out of thin
air, the number of cars entering each intersection has to equal the number exiting. For
example, at the intersection of Allen and Baker Streets there are 200 cars entering and
x + y cars exiting:
Trafﬁc In = Trafﬁc Out
200 = x + y
At the intersection of Allen and Coal Streets, we get
Trafﬁc In = Trafﬁc Out
x = z + 150
and at the intersection of Baker and Coal Streets, we get
Trafﬁc In = Trafﬁc Out
y + z = 50
We now have the following system of equations:
x + y
= 200

−z = 150
y + z = 50

We now have a system of three equations in three unknowns:

3x −

= 0
Solving the system, we get the solution (x, y, z) = (2, 6, 2).Thus, the airline should
order two 747s, six 777s, and two A330s.

Chapter 2
Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices
If we solve this system using the methods of the preceding section, we ﬁnd that it has
inﬁnitely many solutions. The general solution is
x = z + 150
y = −z + 50
z is arbitrary
Since we do not have a unique solution, it is not possible to determine how many cars
drive along Allen, Baker and Coal Streets every hour.
b. The trafﬁc ﬂow along Baker Street is measured by y. From the general solution,
y = −z + 50
where z is arbitrary. How arbitrary is z? It makes no sense for any of the variables x,
y, or z to be negative in this scenario, so z ≥0. Therefore, the largest possible value y
can have is
y = −0 + 50 = 50 cars per hour
c. The trafﬁc ﬂow along Allen Street is measured by x. From the general solution,
x = z + 150
where z ≥0, as we saw in part (b). Therefore, the smallest possible value x can have is
x = 0 + 150 = 150 cars per hour
d. The trafﬁc ﬂow along Coal Street is measured by z. Referring to the general solu-
tion, we see that z shows up in the expressions for both x and y:
x = z + 150
y = −z + 50
In the ﬁrst of these equations, there is nothing preventing z from being as big as we
like; the larger we make z, the larger x becomes. However, the second equation places
a limit on how large z can be: if z > 50, then y is negative, which is impossible. There-
fore, the largest value z can take is 50 cars per hour.
From the discussion above, we see that z is not completely arbitrary: we must have
z ≥0 and z ≤50. Thus, z has to satisfy 0 ≤z ≤50 for us to get a realistic answer.
+Before we go on... Here are some questions to think about in Example 3: If you wanted
to nail down x, y, and z to see where the cars are really going, how would you do it with
only one more trafﬁc counter? Would it make sense for z to be fractional? What if you
interpreted x, y, and z as average numbers of cars per hour over a long period of time?
Trafﬁc ﬂow is only one kind of ﬂow in which we might be interested. Water and
electricity ﬂows are others. In each case, to analyze the ﬂow, we use the fact that the
amount entering an intersection must equal the amount leaving it. ■
Example 4 Transportation
A car rental company has four locations in the city: Northside, Eastside, Southside, and
Westside. The Westside location has 20 more cars than it needs, and the Eastside loca-
tion has 15 more cars than it needs. The Northside location needs 10 more cars than it
has, and the Southside location needs 25 more cars than it has. It costs $10 (in salary and
gas) to have an employee drive a car from Westside to Northside. It costs $5 to drive a

2.3 Applications of Systems of Linear Equations
151
car from Eastside to Northside. It costs $20 to drive a car from Westside to Southside,
and it costs $10 to drive a car from Eastside to Southside. If the company will spend a
total of $475 rearranging its cars, how many cars will it drive from each of Westside and
Eastside to each of Northside and Southside?
Solution
Figure 8 shows a diagram of this situation. Each
arrow represents a route along which the rental
company can drive cars. Next to each location is
written the number of extra cars the location has or
the number it needs. Next to each route is written
the cost of driving a car along that route.
The unknowns are the number of cars the
company will drive along each route, so we have
the following four unknowns, as indicated in the
ﬁgure:
x = number of cars driven from Westside to Northside
y = number of cars driven from Eastside to Northside
z = number of cars driven from Westside to Southside
w = number of cars driven from Eastside to Southside
Consider the Northside location. It needs 10 more cars, so the total number of cars being
driven to Northside should be 10. This gives us the equation
x + y = 10
Similarly, the total number of cars being driven to Southside should be 25, so
z + w = 25
Considering the number of cars to be driven out of the Westside and Eastside locations,
we get the following two equations as well:
x + z = 20
y + w = 15
There is one more equation that we should write down, the equation that says that the
company will spend $475:
10x + 5y + 20z + 10w = 475
Thus, we have the following system of ﬁve equations in four unknowns:
x + y
= 10
z +
w = 25
x
+
z
= 20
y
+
w = 15
10x + 5y + 20z + 10w = 475
Solving this system, we ﬁnd that (x, y, z, w) = (5, 5, 15, 10). In words, the company
will drive 5 cars from Westside to Northside, 5 from Eastside to Northside, 15 from
Westside to Southside, and 10 from Eastside to Southside.

+Before we go on... A very reasonable question to ask in Example 4 is, Can the com-
pany rearrange its cars for less than $475? Even better, what is the least possible cost?
In general, a question asking for the optimal cost may require the techniques of linear
programming that we will discuss in Chapter 4. However, in this case we can approach
the problem directly. If we remove the equation that says that the total cost is $475 and
solve the system consisting of the other four equations, we ﬁnd that there are inﬁnitely
many solutions and that the general solution may be written as
x = w −5
y = 15 −w
z = 25 −w
w is arbitrary
This allows us to write the total cost as a function of w:
10x + 5y + 20z + 10w = 10(w −5) + 5(15 −w) + 20(25 −w) + 10w
= 525 −5w
So, the larger we make w, the smaller the total cost will be. The largest we can make w
is 15 (why?), and if we do so we get (x, y, z, w) = (10, 0, 10, 15) and a total cost of
$450. ■

747s seat 400 passengers and are priced at $200 million each,
Boeing 777s seat 300 passengers and are priced at $160 mil-
lion, and the European Airbus A330s seat 300 passengers and
are priced at $120 million. You are the purchasing manager of
an airline company and have a spending goal of $2400 million
for the purchase of new aircraft to seat a total of 5000 passen-
gers. Your company has a policy of supporting U.S. industries,
and you have been instructed to buy twice as many U.S. man-

7. ●SupplyA bagel store orders cream cheese from three suppli-
ers, Cheesy Cream Corp. (CCC), Super Smooth & Sons (SSS),
and Bagel’s Best Friend Co. (BBF). One month, the total order
of cheese came to 100 tons (they do a booming trade). The
costs were $80, $50 and $65 per ton from the three suppliers re-
spectively, with total cost amounting to $5990. Given that the
store ordered the same amount from CCC and BBF, how many
tons of cream cheese were ordered from each supplier?

followers that many a notorious villain has fallen to his awe-
some sword: his total of 560 victims consists of evil sorcerers,
trolls and orcs. These he has slain with a total of 620 mighty
thrusts of his sword; evil sorcerers and trolls each requiring
two thrusts (to the chest) and orcs each requiring one thrust
(to the neck). When asked about the number of trolls he has
slain, he replies, “I, the mighty Conan, despise trolls ﬁve
times as much as I despise evil sorcerers. Accordingly, ﬁve
times as many trolls as evil sorcerers have fallen to my
sword!” How many of each type of villain has he slain?

pany recently had its secret formula divulged. It turned out
that it was using, as the three ingredients, rose oil, oil of fer-
mented prunes, and alcohol. Moreover, each 22-ounce econo-
size bottle contained 4 more ounces of alcohol than oil of
fermented prunes, while the amount of alcohol was equal to
the combined volume of the other two ingredients. How much
of each ingredient did it use in an econo-size bottle?18
11. Music CD Sales In 2000, total revenues from sales of recorded
rock, rap, and classical music amounted to $5.8 billion. Rock
music brought in twice as much revenue as rap music and
900% the revenue of classical music.19 How much revenue was
earned in each of the three categories of recorded music?
12. Music CD Sales In 2000, combined revenues from sales of
“oldies” and soundtracks amounted to $0.23 billion. Country
music brought in 15 times as much revenue as soundtracks,
and revenue from the sale of oldies was 30% above that of
soundtracks.20 How much revenue was earned in each of the
three categories of recorded music?
13. Donations The Enormous State University Good Works Soci-
ety recently raised funds for three worthwhile causes; the Math
Professors’ Benevolent Fund (MPBF), the Society of Com-
puter Nerds (SCN), and the NY Jets. Because the society’s
members are closet jocks, the society donated twice as much to
the NY Jets as to the MPBF, and equal amounts to the ﬁrst two
funds (it is unable to distinguish between mathematicians and
nerds). Further, for every $1 it gave to the MPBF, it decided to
keep $1 for itself; for every $1 it gave to the SCN, it kept $2,
and for every $1 to the Jets, it also kept $2.The treasurer of the
Society, JohnnyTreasure, was required to itemize all donations
for the Dean of Students, but discovered to his consternation
that he had lost the receipts! The only information available to
him was that the society’s bank account had swelled by $4200.
How much did the society donate to each cause?
14. Tenure Professor Walt is up for tenure, and wishes to submit a
portfolio of written student evaluations as evidence of his good
teaching. He begins by grouping all the evaluations into four
categories: good reviews; bad reviews—a typical one being
“GET RID OF WALT! THE MAN CAN’T TEACH!”—
mediocre reviews—such as “I suppose he’s OK, given the gen-
eral quality of teaching here at ______ University,” and reviews
left blank. When he tallies up the piles, Walt gets a little wor-
ried: There are 280 more bad reviews than good ones and only
half as many blank reviews as bad ones. The good reviews and
blank reviews together total 170. On an impulse, he decides to
even up the piles a little by removing 280 of the bad reviews
(including the memorable “GET RID OF WALT” review), and
this leaves him with a total of 400 reviews of all types. How
many of each category of reviews were there originally?

Ex Market Share: Auto Insurance The three market
leaders in auto insurance in Missouri are State Farm, Ameri-
can Family Insurance Group, and Zurich Insurance, Based on
data from 1999 through 2002, two relationships between the
Missouri auto insurance market shares are found to be
x = 0.30 −0.12y −0.70z
z = 0.35 −0.53w
where x, y, z, and w are, respectively, the fractions of the mar-
ket held by State Farm, American Family, Zurich Insurance,
and Other.27 Given that the four groups account for the entire
market, obtain a third equation relating x, y, z, andw, and solve
the associated system of three linear equations to show how the
market shares of State Farm, American Family and Zurich In-
surance depend on the share held by Other. (Round all coefﬁ-
cients to two decimal places.) Which of the three companies’
market share is most impacted by the share held by Other?

from its warehouses in Brooklyn and Queens to its stores, one
on Long Island and one in Manhattan. Its warehouse in
Brooklyn has 1000 books and its warehouse in Queens has
2000. Each store orders 1500 books. It costs $1 to ship each
book from Brooklyn to Manhattan and $2 to ship each book
from Queens to Manhattan. It costs $5 to ship each book from
Brooklyn to Long Island and $4 to ship each book from
Queens to Long Island.
a. IfBig Red hasa transportation budgetof $9000 and is willing
to spend all of it, how many books should Big Red ship from
each warehouse to each store in order to ﬁll all the orders?
b. Is there a way of doing this for less money? hint [see

26. ●Inventory Control The Tubular Ride Boogie Board Com-
pany has manufacturing plants in Tucson, AZ and Toronto,
Ontario. You have been given the job of coordinating distrib-
ution of the latest model, the Gladiator, to outlets in Honolulu
and Venice Beach. The Tucson plant, when operating at full
capacity, can manufacture 620 Gladiator boards per week,
while the Toronto plant, beset by labor disputes, can produce
only 410 boards per week. The outlet in Honolulu orders 500
Gladiator boards per week, while Venice Beach orders 530
boards per week. Transportation costs are as follows:
Tucson to Honolulu: $10 per board; Tucson to Venice
Beach: $5 per board;
Toronto to Honolulu: $20 per board; Toronto to Venice
Beach: $10 per board.
a. Assuming that you wish to ﬁll all orders and assure full
capacity production at both plants, is it possible to meet a
total transportation budget of $10,200? If so, how many
Gladiator boards are shipped from each manufacturing
plant to each distribution outlet?

33. Trafﬁc Management The Outer Village Town Council has de-
cided to convert its (rather quiet) main street, Broadway, to a
one-way street, but is not sure of the direction of most of the
trafﬁc. The accompanying diagram illustrates the downtown
area of Outer Village, as well as the net trafﬁc ﬂow along the
intersecting streets (in vehicles per day). (There are no one-
way streets; a net trafﬁc ﬂow in a certain direction is deﬁned
as the trafﬁc ﬂow in that direction minus the ﬂow in the oppo-
site direction.)
a. Is the given information sufﬁcient to determine the net
trafﬁc ﬂow along the three portions of Broadway shown?
If your answer is yes, give the trafﬁc ﬂow along each
stretch. If your answer is no, what additional information
would sufﬁce? [Hint: For the direction of net trafﬁc
ﬂow, choose either east or west. If a corresponding
value is negative, it indicates net ﬂow in the opposite
direction.]

CAT Scans CAT (Computerized Axial Tomographic) scans are
used to map the exact location of interior features of the human
body. CAT scan technology is based on the following principles:
(1) different components of the human body (water, gray matter,
bone, etc.) absorb X-rays to different extents; and (2) to measure
the X-ray absorption by a speciﬁc region of, say, the brain, it suf-
ﬁces to pass a number of line-shaped pencil beams of X-rays
through the brain at different angles and measure the total ab-
sorption for each beam, which is the sum of the absorptions of the
regions through which it passes. The accompanying diagram il-
lustrates a simple example. (The number in each region shows its
absorption, and the number on each X-ray beam shows the total
absorption for that beam.)33

33 Based on a COMAP article Geometry, New Tools for New Technologies,
by J. Malkevitch, Video Applications Library, COMAP, 1992. The absorp-
tions are actually calibrated on a logarithmic scale. In real applications,
the size of the regions is very small, and very large numbers of beams
must be used.

an $8 million return on investments totaling $65 million last
year. After a few frantic telephone calls to sources in Colossal,
he learned that Colossal had made investments in four compa-
nies last year: X,Y, Z and W. (For reasons of conﬁdentiality, we
are withholding their names.) Investments in company X earned
15% last year, investments inY depreciated by 20% last year, in-
vestments in Z neither appreciated nor depreciated last year,
while investments in W earned 20% last year. Smiley was also

curate Accounting, Inc.! Colossal Conglomerate Corp’s tax
return is due tomorrow and the accountant Todd Smiley
seems to have no idea how Colossal earned a return of $8 mil-
lion on a $65 million investment last year. It appears that, al-
though the returns from companies X, Y, Z and W were as
listed in Exercise 45, the rest of the information there was
wrong. What Smiley is now being told is that Colossal only
invested in companies X, Y and Z and that the investment in
X amounted to $30 million. His sources in Colossal still
maintain that twice as much was invested in company X as in
company Z. What should Smiley do?

shark can consume 1 goldﬁsh, 2 angelﬁsh and 2 butterﬂy ﬁsh
per day; each piranha can consume 1 goldﬁsh and 3 butterﬂy
ﬁsh per day (the piranhas are rather large as a result of their
diet) while each squid can consume 1 goldﬁsh and 1 angelﬁsh
per day. After a trip to the local pet store, he was able to feed
his creatures to capacity, and noticed that 21 goldﬁsh, 21 an-
gelﬁsh and 35 butterﬂy ﬁsh were eaten. How many of each
type of creature does he have?

bined website trafﬁc at the three sites is estimated at 10,000
hits per day. Only 10% of the hits at OHaganBooks.com result
in orders, whereas JungleBooks.com and FarmerBooks.com
report that 20% of the hits at their sites result in book orders.
Together, the three sites process 1500 book orders per day.
FarmerBooks.com appears to be the most successful of the
three, and gets as many book orders as the other two com-
bined. What is the trafﬁc (in hits per day) at each of the sites?

CAS E  STU DY :  The Impact of Regulating Sulfur Emissions
Your consulting company has been hired by the EPA.
The EPA is considering regulations requiring a
15 million-ton rollback in sulfur emissions in an ef-
fort to curb the effects of acid rain on the ecosystem.
The EPA would like to have an estimate of the cost to
the major utility companies and the effect on jobs in
the coal mining industry. The following data are
available:35

age of books are as follows:

Is it possible to ﬁll both orders and clear the Illinois ware-
house at a cost of $22,000? If so, how many packages should

Your assignment is to use these data to give projections of the annual cost to utilities and
the cost in jobs if the regulations were to be enacted.
You decide to consider the annual cost C to utilities and the job loss J separately.
After giving the situation some thought, you decide to have two equations, one giving C
in terms of the rollback tonnage t and the other giving J in terms of t. Your ﬁrst inclina-
tion is to try linear equations—that is, an equation of the form
C = at + b
(a and b constants)
and a similar one for J, but you quickly discover that the data simply won’t ﬁt, no mat-
ter what the choice of the constants. The reason for this can be seen graphically by plot-
ting C and J versus t (Figure 9). In neither case do the three points lie on a straight line.
In fact, the job data are not even close to being linear. Thus, you will need curves to
model these data.
35 SOURCE: Congress of the United States, Congressional Budget Ofﬁce, Curbing Acid Rain: Cost, Budget, and
Coal Market Effects (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Ofﬁce, 1986): xx, xxii, 23, 80.
* The reason that job losses drop when the rollback is increased to 12 million tons is that a rollback of this
magnitude requires that expensive scrubbers be installed to ﬁlter emissions, even if a utility company has
switched from coal to other energy sources. Once the scrubbers are installed, it pays the utility companies to
switch back to (cheaper) coal as a primary source of energy. A 10-million-ton reduction, on the other hand, re-
sults in a massive move away from coal—this being cheaper than installing scrubbers—and hence a dramatic
job loss in the coal mining industry.

After giving the matter further thought, you remember something your mathemat-
ics instructor once said: the simplest curve passing through any three points not all on
the same line is a parabola. Since you are looking for a simple model of the data, you de-
cide to try a parabola. A general parabola has the equation
C = at2 + bt + c
where a, b and c are constants. The problem now is: what are a, b, and c? You decide to
try substituting the values of C and t into the general equation, and you get the following.
t = 8, C = 20.4
gives
20.4 = 64a + 8b + c
t = 10, C = 34.5
gives
34.5 = 100a + 10b + c
t = 12, C = 93.6
gives
93.6 = 144a + 12b + c
Now you notice that you have three linear equations in three unknowns! You solve the
system:
a = 5.625, b = −94.2, c = 414
Thus your cost equation becomes
C = 5.625t2 −94.2t + 414
You now substitute t = 15 to get C = 266.625. In other words, you are able to predict
an annual cost to the utility industry of $266.625 billion.
Forging ahead, you turn to the jobs equation, and write
J = at2 + bt + c
Substituting the data from the second column of the chart, you obtain
14,100 = 64a + 8b + c
21,900 = 100a + 10b + c
13,400 = 144a + 12b + c
You solve this system and ﬁnd that
a = −2,037.5, b = 40,575, c = −180,100
Thus, your jobs equation is
J = −2,037.5t2 + 40,575t −180,100
Substituting t = 15, you get J = −29,912.5. Uh-oh! A negative number! Just what does
this mean? Well, if there were to be −29,913 jobs lost, then there would be 29,913 new
jobs created!36 Figure 10 shows the parabolas superimposed on the data points.
You thus submit the following projection: a 15-million-ton rollback will result in an
annual cost of approximately $266.6 billion to the utility industry, but will also result in
the creation of approximately 29,900 new jobs in the coal mining industry.

36 The logic is this: Since the stringent new emission standards would require that even more scrubbers be
installed, the utility industry might as well increase its use of coal (which tends to be far cheaper than other
energy sources), thus creating a boom for the coal industry.

Ex You submit your projections on the cost of regulating sulfur emissions, and
the EPA tells you, “Thank you very much, but we made a small mistake: a 15-million-
ton rollback has in fact already been in effect for the past year, and has resulted in a
cost of $250 billion to the utilities and the creation of 8,000 jobs in the coal mining
industry.” (Apparently, utilities have been switching back to coal at a greater rate than
anticipated.) In view of this, the EPA is now considering a 20-million-ton rollback.
You are to come up with projections by tomorrow. [Hint: Since you now have four
data points on each graph, try a general cubic instead: C = at3 + bt2 + ct + d.]

Example 1 Find all solutions (x, y) of the following sys-
tem of two equations:
x + y = 3
x −y = 1
Solution with Technology You can use a graphing calcu-
lator to draw the graphs of the two equations on the same
set of axes and to check the solution. First, solve the equa-
tions for y, obtaining y = −x + 3 and y = x −1. On the
TI-83/84:
1. Set
Y1=-X+3
Y2=X-1
2. Decide on the range of x-values you want to use. As in
Figure 1, let us choose the range [−4, 4].38
3. In the

You can now zoom in for a more accurate view by choos-
ing a smaller x-range that includes the point of intersec-
tion, like [1.5, 2.5], and using Zoomﬁt again. You can
also use the trace feature to see the coordinates of points
near the point of intersection.
38 How did we come up with this interval? Trial and error. You might need
to try several intervals before ﬁnding one that gives a graph showing the
point of intersection clearly.

and Y2; they should each be 1.
Q: Is it always possible to find the exact answer using a

this solution in decimal form, we get repeating decimals:
( −0.0769 230769230 . . . , 0.384615384615 . . .). Since the
graphing calculator gives the coordinates of points only to sev-
eral decimal places, it can show only an approximate answer. ■
Q: How accurate is the answer shown using the trace feature?
A: That depends. We can increase the accuracy up to a point 
by zooming in on the point of intersection of the two graphs. 
But there is a limit to this: Most graphing calculators are 
capable of giving an answer correct to about 13 decimal 
places. This means, for instance, that, in the eyes of the TI-83/84,
2.000 000 000 000 1 is exactly the same as 2 (subtracting them
yields 0). It follows that if you attempt to use a window so 
narrow that you need approximately 13 significant digits to 
distinguish the left and right edges, you will run into accuracy
problems.■

2. Copy the formulas in B3 and C3 down to row 4 to obtain the corresponding values of y.

Excel will show an array formula enclosed in “curly braces.” (Note that you must also use Control-Shift-Enter to delete
any array you create: select the block you wish to delete and press Delete followed by Control-Shift-Enter.)

Introduction
We used matrices in Chapter 2 simply to organize our work. It is time we examined them
as interesting objects in their own right. There is much that we can do with matrices
besides row operations: We can add, subtract, multiply, and even, in a sense, “divide”
matrices. We use these operations to study game theory and input-output models in this
chapter, and Markov chains in a later chapter.
Many calculators, electronic spreadsheets, and other computer programs can do
these matrix operations, which is a big help in doing calculations. However, we need to
know how these operations are deﬁned to see why they are useful and to understand
which to use in any particular application.

There is a systematic way of referring to particular entries in a matrix. If i and j are num-
bers, then the entry in the ith row and jth column of the matrix A is called the i jth entry
of A. We usually write this entry as ai j or Ai j. (If the matrix was called B, we would
write its i jth entry as bi j or Bi j.) Notice that this follows the “RC” convention: The row
number is speciﬁed ﬁrst and the column number second.

We say that two matrices A and B are equal if they have the same dimensions and
the corresponding entries are equal. Note that a 3 × 4 matrix can never equal a 3 × 5
matrix because they do not have the same dimensions.

Matrix Addition and Subtraction
The ﬁrst matrix operations we discuss are matrix addition and subtraction. The rules for
these operations are simple.

quick Examples
Matrix Addition and Subtraction 
Two matrices can be added (or subtracted) if and only if they have the same dimensions.
To add (or subtract) two matrices of the same dimensions, we add (or subtract) the cor-
responding entries. More formally, if A and B are m × n matrices, then A + B and
A −B are the m × n matrices whose entries are given by:
(A + B)i j = Ai j + Bi j
i jth entry of the sum = sum of the i jth entries
(A −B)i j = Ai j −Bi j
i jth entry of the difference = difference of the i jth entries

Scalar Multiplication
A matrix A can be added to itself because the expression A + A is the sum of two ma-
trices that have the same dimensions. When we compute A + A, we end up doubling
every entry in A. So we can think of the expression 2A as telling us to multiply every
element in A by 2. 
In general, to multiply a matrix by a number, multiply every entry in the matrix by
that number. For example,

It is traditional when talking about matrices to call individual numbers scalars. For this
reason, we call the operation of multiplying a matrix by a number scalar multiplication.

Use matrix arithmetic to calculate the change in sales of each product in each store from

Scalar Multiplication
If A is an m × n matrix and c is a real number, then cA is the m × n matrix obtained by
multiplying all the entries of A by c. (We usually use lowercase letters c, d, e, . . . to
denote scalars.) Thus, the i jth entry of cA is given by
(cA)i j = c(Ai j)

In words, this rule is: To get the i jth entry of cA, multiply the i jth entry of A by c.

Addition and scalar multiplication of matrices have nice properties, reminiscent of
the properties of addition and multiplication of real numbers. Before we state them, we
need to introduce some more notation.
If A is any matrix, then −A is the matrix (−1)A. In other words, −A is A multiplied
by the scalar −1. This amounts to changing the signs of all the entries in A. For example,

Properties of Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication
If A, B, and C are any m × n matrices and if O is the zero m × n matrix, then the fol-
lowing hold:
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
Associative law
A + B = B + A
Commutative law
A + O = O + A = A
Additive identity law
A + (−A) = O = (−A) + A
Additive inverse law
c(A + B) = cA + cB
Distributive law
(c + d)A = cA + d A
Distributive law
1A = A
Scalar unit
0A = O
Scalar zero
These properties would be obvious if we were talking about addition and multiplication
of numbers, but here we are talking about addition and multiplication of matrices. We
are using “+” to mean something new: matrix addition. There is no reason why matrix
addition has to obey all the properties of addition of numbers. It happens that it does
obey many of them, which is why it is convenient to call it addition in the ﬁrst place.
This means that we can manipulate equations involving matrices in much the same way
that we manipulate equations involving numbers. One word of caution: We haven’t yet
discussed how to multiply matrices, and it probably isn’t what you think. It will turn out
that multiplication of matrices does not obey all the same properties as multiplication of
numbers.

Transposition
We mention one more operation on matrices:
180
Chapter 3
Matrix Algebra and Applications
quick Examples
Transposition
If A is an m × n matrix, then its transpose is the n × m matrix obtained by writing its
rows as columns, so that the ith row of the original matrix becomes the ith column of the
transpose. We denote the transpose of the matrix A by AT.
Visualizing Transposition
Properties of Transposition
If A and B are m × n matrices, then the following hold: 
(A + B)T = AT + BT
(cA)T = c(AT )
(AT )T = A
To see why the laws of transposition are true, let us consider the ﬁrst one: (A + B)T =
AT + BT. The left-hand side is the transpose of A + B, and so is obtained by ﬁrst adding
A and B, and then writing the rows as columns. This is the same as ﬁrst writing the rows
of A and B individually as columns before adding, which gives the right-hand side.
Similar arguments can be used to establish the other laws of transposition.

3.2 Matrix Multiplication
Suppose we buy 2 CDs at $3 each and 4 Zip disks at $5 each. We calculate our total cost
by computing the products’ price × quantity and adding:

Let us instead put the prices in a row vector
P = [3

Q: Why a row and a column?
A: It’s rather a long story, but mathematicians found that it works best this way . . .
Because P represents the prices of the items we are purchasing and Q represents the quantities,
it would be useful if the product P Q represented the total cost, a single number (which we can
think of as a 1 × 1 matrix). For this to work, P Q should be calculated the same way we calcu-
lated the total cost:
PQ = [ 3
5 ]
 2


= [3 × 2 + 5 × 4] = [26]
Notice that we obtain the answer by multiplying each entry in P (going from left to right) by the
corresponding entry in Q (going from top to bottom) and then adding the results. ■
quick Examples
The Product Row × Column
The product AB of a row matrix A and a column matrix B is a 1 × 1 matrix. The length
of the row in A must match the length of the column in B for the product to be deﬁned.
To ﬁnd the product, multiply each entry in A (going from left to right) by the corre-
sponding entry in B (going from top to bottom) and then add the results.

Example 1 Revenue
The A-Plus auto parts store mentioned in examples in the previous section had the fol-
lowing sales in its Vancouver store:
The store sells wiper blades for $7.00 each, cleaning ﬂuid for $3.00 per bottle, and ﬂoor
mats for $12.00 each. Use matrix multiplication to ﬁnd the total revenue generated by
sales of these items.
Solution We need to multiply each sales ﬁgure by the corresponding price and then
add the resulting revenue ﬁgures. We represent the sales by a column vector, as sug-
gested by the table.
Q =



We put the selling prices in a row vector.
P = [ 7.00

We can now compute the total revenue as the product
R = PQ = [7.00



= [140.00 + 30.00 + 96.00] = [266.00]
So, the sale of these items generated a total revenue of $266.00.

b. Represent the linear equation 3x + y −z + 2w = 8 as a matrix equation.

Thus the equation may be rewritten as
[2x −4y + z] = [5]

In general for matrices A and B, we can take the product AB only if the number of
columns of A equals the number of rows of B (so that we can multiply the rows of A by the

The fact that the number of columns in the left-hand matrix equals the number of rows
in the right-hand matrix amounts to saying that the middle two numbers must match as
above. If we “cancel” the middle matching numbers, we are left with the dimensions of
the product.
Before continuing with examples, we state the rule for matrix multiplication
formally.

Note In part (a) we cannot multiply the matrices in the opposite order—the dimensions
do not match. We say simply that the product in the opposite order is not deﬁned. In part
(b) we can multiply the matrices in the opposite order, but we would get a 1 × 1 matrix
if we did so. Thus, order is important when multiplying matrices. In general, if AB is de-
ﬁned, then B A need not even be deﬁned. If B A is also deﬁned, it may not have the same
dimensions as AB. And even if AB and B A have the same dimensions, they may have
different entries (see the next example). ■

same dimensions. (There are instances when AB = B A for particular matrices A and B,
but this is an exception, not the rule.)

The usual selling prices for these items are $7.00 each for wiper blades, $3.00 per bottle
for cleaning ﬂuid, and $12.00 each for ﬂoor mats. The discount prices for A-Plus Club
members are $6.00 each for wiper blades, $2.00 per bottle for cleaning ﬂuid, and $10.00

assuming ﬁrst that all items were sold at the usual prices, and then that they were all sold
at the discount prices.

+Before we go on... In Example 5 we were able to calculate PQ because the dimensions
matched correctly: (2 × 3)(3 × 2) →2 × 2. We could also have multiplied them in the
opposite order and gotten a 3 × 3 matrix. Would the product QP be meaningful? In an

application like this, not only do the dimensions have to match, but also the labels have
to match for the result to be meaningful. The labels on the three columns of P are the
parts that were sold, and these are also the labels on the three rows of Q. Therefore, we
can “cancel labels” at the same time that we cancel the dimensions in the product. How-
ever, the labels on the two columns of Q do not match the labels on the two rows of P,
and there is no useful interpretation of the product QP in this situation. ■

if I is the 2 × 2 identity matrix and A is any 3 × 2 matrix (try one). In fact, if I is any iden-
tity matrix, then AI = A whenever the product is deﬁned, and I A = A whenever this
product is deﬁned. ■
Properties of Matrix Addition and Multiplication
If A, B and C are matrices, if O is a zero matrix, and if I is an identity matrix, then the
following hold:
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
Additive associative law
A + B = B + A
Additive commutative law
A + O = O + A = A
Additive identity law
A + (−A) = O = (−A) + A
Additive inverse law
c(A + B) = cA + cB
Distributive law
(c + d)A = cA + d A

how to get an identity matrix

In the online Matrix Algebra 
Tool at

 Matrix Algebra Tool
use I in a formula to refer to the
identity matrix of any dimension.
The program will choose the cor-
rect dimension in the context of
the formula. For example, if A is
a 3 x 3 matrix, then the expres-
sion I-A uses the 3 x 3 identity
matrix for I.

Note that we have not included a multiplicative commutative law for matrices, because
the equation AB = B A does not hold in general. In other words, matrix multiplication
is not exactly like multiplication of numbers. (You have to be a little careful because it
is easy to apply the commutative law without realizing it.)
We should also say a bit more about transposition. Transposition and multiplication
have an interesting relationship. We write down the properties of transposition again,
adding one new one.

These properties give you a glimpse of the ﬁeld of mathematics known as abstract
algebra. Algebraists study operations like these that resemble the operations on num-
bers but differ in some way, such as the lack of commutativity for multiplication seen
here.
We end this section with more on the relationship between linear equations and
matrix equations, which is one of the important applications of matrix multiplication.

Because these two matrices are equal, their corresponding entries must be equal.
x −2y + 3z = 3

−z = −1
−3x + y + z = 0
In other words, the matrix equation AX = B is equivalent to this system of linear
equations. Notice that the coefﬁcients of the left-hand sides of these equations are the
entries of the matrix A. We call A the coefﬁcient matrix of the system of equations.
The entries of X are the unknowns and the entries of B are the right-hand sides 3, −1,
and 0.
b. As we saw in part (a), the coefﬁcient matrix A has entries equal to the coefﬁcients of
the left-hand sides of the equations. Thus,
A =

and

The system of equations can be rewritten as the matrix equation AX = B with this A, X,
and B.
This translation of systems of linear equations into matrix equations is really the
ﬁrst step in the method of solving linear equations discussed in Chapter 2. There we
worked with the augmented matrix of the system, which is simply A with B adjoined
as an extra column.

Q: When we write a system of equations as AX = B, couldn’t we solve for the unknown X by di-
viding both sides by A ?
A: If we interpret division as multiplication by the inverse (for example, 2 ÷ 3 = 2 × 3−1), we
shall see in the next section that certain systems of the form AX = B can be solved in this way,
by multiplying both sides by A−1. We first need to discuss what we mean by A−1 and how to cal-
culate it. ■

memory chips, and 40 vacuum tubes. There are two compa-
nies that can supply these parts: Motorel can supply them at
$100 per processor chip, $50 per memory chip, and $10 per
vacuum tube, while Intola can supply them at $150 per
processor chip, $40 per memory chip, and $15 per vacuum

show how matrix multiplication allows you to compute the

tube. Use matrix operations to ﬁnd the total proﬁt Motorel

Matrix Inversion
Now that we’ve discussed matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication, you may well
be wondering about matrix division. In the realm of real numbers, division can be
thought of as a form of multiplication: Dividing 3 by 7 is the same as multiplying 3 by
1/7, the inverse of 7. In symbols, 3 ÷ 7 = 3 × (1/7), or 3 × 7−1. In order to imitate
division of real numbers in the realm of matrices, we need to discuss the multiplicative
inverse, A−1, of a matrix A.
Note Because multiplication of real numbers is commutative, we can write, for exam-
ple, 3
7 as either 3 × 7−1 or 7−1 × 3. In the realm of matrices, multiplication is not com-
mutative, so from now on we shall never talk about “division” of matrices (by “ B
A”
should we mean A−1B or B A−1?). ■
Before we try to ﬁnd the inverse of a matrix, we must ﬁrst know exactly what we
mean by the inverse. Recall that the inverse of a number a is the number, often written
a−1, with the property that a−1 · a = a · a−1 = 1. For example, the inverse of 76 is the
number 76−1 = 1/76, because (1/76) · 76 = 76 · (1/76) = 1. This is the number
calculated by the x−1 button found on most calculators. Not all numbers have an inverse.

For example—and this is the only example—the number 0 has no inverse, because you
cannot get 1 by multiplying 0 by anything.
The inverse of a matrix is deﬁned similarly. To make life easier, we shall restrict
attention to square matrices, matrices that have the same number of rows as 
columns.15
3.3 Matrix Inversion

quick Examples
Inverse of a Matrix
The inverse of an n × n matrix A is that n × n matrix A−1 which, when multiplied by A
on either side, yields the n × n identity matrix I. Thus,
AA−1 = A−1A = I
If A has an inverse, it is said to be invertible. Otherwise, it is said to be singular.
1. The inverse of the 1 × 1 matrix [3] is [1/3], because [3][1/3] = [1] = [1/3][3].
2. The inverse of the n × n identity matrix I is I itself, because I × I = I.Thus, I −1 = I.

Notes
1. It is possible to show that if A and B are square matrices with AB = I , then it must
also be true that B A = I . In other words, once we have checked that AB = I , we
know that B is the inverse of A. The second check, that B A = I , is unnecessary.
2. If B is the inverse of A, then we can also say that A is the inverse of B (why?). Thus,
we sometimes refer to such a pair of matrices as an inverse pair of matrices. ■
15 Nonsquare matrices cannot have inverses in the sense that we are talking about here. This is not a trivial fact
to prove.
Example 1 Singular Matrix
Can A =



have an inverse?
Solution No. To see why not, notice that both entries in the second row of AB will be
0, no matter what B is. So AB cannot equal I, no matter what B is. Hence, A is singular.
+Before we go on... If you think about it, you can write down many similar examples of
singular matrices. There is only one number with no multiplicative inverse (0), but there
are many matrices having no inverses. ■

Inverting an n × n Matrix
In order to determine whether an n × n matrix A is invertible or not, and to ﬁnd A−1 if
it does exist, follow this procedure:
1. Write down the n × 2n matrix [A| I] (this is A with the n × n identity matrix set next
to it).
2. Row-reduce [A| I].
3. If the reduced form is [I | B] (i.e., has the identity matrix in the left part), then A is in-
vertible and B = A−1. If you cannot obtain I in the left part, then A is singular. (See
Example 3 below.)

Although there is a general formula for the inverse of a matrix, it is not a simple one. In
fact, using the formula for anything larger than a 3 × 3 matrix is so inefﬁcient that the
row-reduction procedure is the method of choice even for computers. However, the gen-
eral formula is very simple for the special case of 2 × 2 matrices:

reduction. (See the Communication and Reasoning Exercises at the end of the section.)

We stopped here, even though the reduction is incomplete, because there is no hope of
getting the identity on the left-hand side. Completing the row reduction will not change
the three zeros in the bottom row. So what is wrong? Nothing. As in Example 1, we have
here a singular matrix. Any square matrix that, after row reduction, winds up with a row
of zeros is singular (see Exercise 77).

3.3 Matrix Inversion
203
+Before we go on... In practice, deciding whether a given matrix is invertible or singu-
lar is easy: simply try to ﬁnd its inverse. If the process works, then the matrix is invert-
ible, and we get its inverse. If the process fails, then the matrix is singular. If you try to
invert a singular matrix using a spreadsheet, calculator, or computer program, you
should get an error. Sometimes, instead of an error, you will get a spurious answer due
to round-off errors in the device. ■
Using the Inverse to Solve a System of n Linear 
Equations in n Unknowns
Having used systems of equations and row reduction to ﬁnd matrix inverses, we will
now use matrix inverses to solve systems of equations. Recall that, at the end of the pre-
vious section, we saw that a system of linear equations could be written in the form
AX = B
where A is the coefﬁcient matrix, X is the column matrix of unknowns, and B is the
column matrix of right-hand sides. Now suppose that there are as many unknowns as
equations, so that A is a square matrix, and suppose that A is invertible. The object is to
solve for the matrix X of unknowns, so we multiply both sides of the equation by the in-
verse A−1 of A, getting
A−1AX = A−1B
Notice that we put A−1 on the left on both sides of the equation. Order matters when
multiplying matrices, so we have to be careful to do the same thing to both sides of the
equation. But now A−1A = I , so we can rewrite the last equation as
I X = A−1B
Also, I X = X (I being the identity matrix), so we really have
X = A−1B
and we have solved for X!
Moreover, we have shown that, if A is invertible and AX = B, then the only possible
solution is X = A−1B. We should check that A−1B is actually a solution by substituting
back into the original equation.
AX = A(A−1B) = (AA−1)B = I B = B
Thus, X = A−1B is a solution and is the only solution. Therefore, if A is invertible,
AX = B has exactly one solution.
On the other hand, if AX = B has no solutions or has inﬁnitely many solutions, we
can conclude that A is not invertible (why?). To summarize:
quick Example
Solving the Matrix Equation AX = B
If A is an invertible matrix, then the matrix equation AX = B has the unique solution
X = A−1B
The system of linear equations
2x

so that (x, y, z) = (3, 3, 3) is the (unique) solution to the system.

Solve the following three systems of equations.
a. 2x
+ z = 1
2x + y −z = 1
3x + y −z = 1
b. 2x
+ z = 0
2x + y −z = 1
3x + y −z = 2
c. 2x
+ z = 0
2x + y −z = 0
3x + y −z = 0
Solution We could go ahead and row-reduce all three augmented matrices as we did in
Chapter 2, but this would require a lot of work. Notice that the coefﬁcients are the same
in all three systems. In other words, we can write the three systems in matrix form as 
a. AX = B
b. AX = C
c. AX = D
where the matrix A is the same in all three cases:
A =
	 2
0

Now the solutions to these systems are
a. X = A−1B
b. X = A−1C

noted (Quick Example above) is

using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter to see
how to do these calculations
using a TI-83/84 or Excel. If,
instead, you use the online
Matrix Algebra Tool, you can
use the formulas A^-1*B,
A^-1*C, and A^-1*D to
compute these products after
entering the matrices A, B and
C as usual (See p. 175.)

3.3 Matrix Inversion
205
+Before we go on... We have been speaking of the inverse of a matrix A. Is there only
one? It is not hard to prove that a matrix A cannot have more than one inverse: If B and
C were both inverses of A, then
B = BI
Property of the identity
= B(AC)
Since C is an inverse of A
= (B A)C
Associative law
= IC
Since B is an inverse of A
= C
Property of the identity
In other words, if B and C were both inverses of A, then B and C would have to be equal. ■
FAQs
Which Method to Use in Solving a System
Q: Now we have two methods to solve a system of linear equations AX = B:
(1) Compute
X = A−1B, or (2) row-reduce the augmented matrix. Which is the better method?
A: Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. Method (1), as we have seen, is very 
efficient when you must solve several systems of equations with the same coefficients, but it
works only when the coefficient matrix is square (meaning that you have the same number of
equations as unknowns) and invertible (meaning that there is a unique solution). The row-
reduction method will work for all systems. Moreover, for all but the smallest systems, the
most efficient way to find A−1 is to use row reduction. Thus, in practice, the two methods are
essentially the same when both apply. ■

It frequently happens that you are faced with making a decision or choosing a best strat-
egy from several possible choices. For instance, you might need to decide whether to in-
vest in stocks or bonds, whether to cut prices of the product you sell, or what offensive
play to use in a football game. In these examples, the result depends on something you
cannot control. In the ﬁrst case, your success depends on the future behavior of the econ-
omy. In the second case, it depends in part on whether your competitors also cut prices,
and in the third case, it depends on the defensive strategy chosen by the opposing team.
We can model situations like these using game theory. We represent the various
options and payoffs in a matrix and can then calculate the best single strategy or combi-
nation of strategies using matrix algebra and other techniques. 
Game theory is very new compared with most of the mathematics you learn. It was
invented in the 1920s by the noted mathematicians Emile Borel (1871–1956) and John
von Neumann (1903–1957). Game theory’s connection with linear programming was
discovered even more recently, in 1947, by von Neumann, and further advances were
made by the mathematician John Nash21 (1928–), for which he received the 1994 Nobel
Prize for Economics.
The Payoff Matrix and Expected Value of a Game
We have probably all played the simple game “Paper, Scissors, Rock” at some time in
our lives. It goes as follows: There are two players—let us call them A and B—and at
each turn, both players produce, by a gesture of the hand, either paper, a pair of scissors,
or a rock. Rock beats scissors (since a rock can crush scissors), but is beaten by paper
(since a rock can be covered by paper), while scissors beat paper (since scissors can cut
paper). The round is a draw if both A and B show the same item. We could turn this into
a betting game if, at each turn, we require the loser to pay the winner 1¢. For instance, if
A shows a rock and B shows paper, then A pays B 1¢.
Paper, Scissors, Rock is an example of a two-person zero-sum game. It is called a
zero-sum game because each player’s loss is equal to the other player’s gain.22 We can
represent this game by a matrix, called the payoff matrix.

if we choose to omit the labels. In the payoff matrix, Player A’s options, or moves, are
listed on the left, while Player B’s options are listed on top. We think of A as playing the
rows and B as playing the columns. Positive numbers indicate a win for the row player,
21 Nash’s turbulent life is the subject of the biography “A Beautiful Mind” by Sylvia Nasar (Simon & Schuster,
1998). The 2001 Academy Award-winning movie of the same title is a somewhat ﬁctionalized account.
22 An example of a nonzero sum game would be one in which the government taxed the earnings of the winner.
In that case the winner’s gain would be less than the loser’s loss.

while negative numbers indicate a loss for the row player. Thus, for example, the p, s
entry represents the outcome if A plays p (paper) and B plays s (scissors). In this event,
B wins, and the –1 entry there indicates that A loses 1¢. (If that entry were –2 instead, it
would have meant that A loses 2¢.)

Chapter 3
Matrix Algebra and Applications
Two-Person Zero-Sum Game
A two-person zero-sum game is one in which one player’s loss equals the other’s gain.
We assume that the outcome is determined by each player’s choice from among a ﬁxed,
ﬁnite set of moves. If Player A has m moves to choose from and Player B has n, we can
represent the game using the payoff matrix, the m × n matrix showing the result of
each possible pair of choices of moves.
In each round of the game, the way a player chooses a move is called a strategy.
A player using a pure strategy makes the same move each round of the game. For ex-
ample, if a player in the above game chooses to play scissors at each turn, then that
player is using the pure strategy s. A player using a mixed strategy chooses each move
a certain percentage of the time in a random fashion; for instance, Player A might
choose to play p 50% of the time, and each of s and r 25% of the time.
Ourultimategoalistobeabletodeterminewhichstrategyisbestforeachplayertouse.
To do that, we need to know how to evaluate strategies. The fundamental calculation we
need is that of the expected value of a pair of strategies. Let’s look at a simple example.
Example 1 Expected Value
Consider the following game:
B
a
b
A p
q

3
−1
−2


Player A decides to pick moves at random, choosing to play p 75% of the time and
q 25% of the time. Player B also picks moves at random, choosing a 20% of the time and
b 80% of the time. On average, how much does A expect to win or lose?
Solution Suppose they play the game 100 times. Each time they play there are four
possible outcomes:
Case 1: A plays p, B plays a.
Because A plays p only 75% of the time and B plays a only 20% of the time, we expect
this case to occur 0.75 × 0.20 = 0.15, or 15% of the time, or 15 times out of 100. Each
time this happens, A gains 3 points, so we get a contribution of 15 × 3 = 45 points to
A’s total winnings.
Case 2: A plays p, B plays b.
Because A plays p only 75% of the time and B plays b only 80% of the time, we expect
this case to occur 0.75 × 0.80 = 0.60, or 60 times out of 100. Each time this happens,
A loses 1 point, so we get a contribution of: 60 × −1 = −60 to A’s total winnings.
Case 3: A plays q, B plays a.
This case occurs 0.25 × 0.20 = 0.05, or 5 out of 100 times, with a loss of 2 points to A
each time, giving a contribution of 5 × −2 = −10 to A’s total winnings.

211
The Expected Value of a Game for Mixed Strategies R and C
The expected value of a game for given mixed strategies is the average payoff that
occurs if the game is played a large number of times with the row and column players
using the given strategies.
To compute the expected value of a game:
1. Write the row player’s mixed strategy as a row matrix R.
2. Write the column player’s mixed strategy as a column matrix C.
3. Calculate the product RPC, where P is the payoff matrix. This product is a 1 × 1 matrix
whose entry is the expected value e.
Case 4: A plays q, B plays b.
This case occurs 0.25 × 0.80 = 0.20, or 20 out of 100 times, with a gain of 3 points to
A each time, giving a contribution of 20 × 3 = 60 to A’s total winnings.
Summing to get A’s total winnings and then dividing by the number of times the game is
played gives the average value of
(45 −60 −10 + 60)/100 = 0.35
so that A can expect to win an average of 0.35 points per play of the game. We call 0.35
the expected value of the game when A and B use these particular strategies.
This calculation was somewhat tedious and it would only get worse if A and B had
many moves to choose from. There is a far more convenient way of doing exactly the
same calculation, using matrix multiplication: We start by representing the player’s
strategies as matrices. For reasons to become clear in a moment, we record A’s strategy
as a row matrix:
R = [0.75
0.25]
We record B’s strategy as a column matrix:
C =

0.20
0.80

(We will sometimes write column vectors using transpose notation, writing, for example,
[0.20
0.80]T for the column above, to save space.) Now: the expected value is the ma-
trix product RPC where P is the payoff matrix!
Expected value = RPC = [0.75


= [0.35]
Why does this work? Write out the arithmetic involved in the matrix product RPC to see
what we calculated:
[0.75 × 3 + 0.25 × (−2)] × 0.20 + [0.75 × (−1) + 0.25 × 3] × 0.80
= 0.75 × 3 × 0.20 + 0.25 × (−2) × 0.20 + 0.75 × (−1) × 0.80 + 0.25 × 3 × 0.80

So, the matrix product does all at once the various cases we considered above.

Example 2 Television Ratings Wars
Commercial TV station RTV and cultural station CTV are competing for viewers in the
Tuesday prime-time 9–10 PM time slot. RTV is trying to decide whether to show a sit-
com, a docudrama, a reality show, or a movie, while CTV is thinking about either a
nature documentary, a symphony concert, a ballet, or an opera. A television rating com-
pany estimates the payoffs for the various alternatives as follows. (Each point indicates
a shift of 1000 viewers from one channel to the other; thus, for instance, –2 indicates a
shift of 2000 viewers from RTV to CTV.)

would it gain if it followed this strategy?
b. If, on the other hand, CTV notices that RTV is showing docudramas half the time
and reality shows the other half, what would CTV’s best strategy be, and how many
viewers would it gain or lose if it followed this strategy?

3.4 Game Theory
213
Solution
a. We are given the matrix of the game, P, in the table above, and we are given CTV’s
strategy C = [0.50 0.50 0 0]T . We are not given RTV’s strategy R. To say that RTV
is looking for its best strategy is to say that it wants the expected value e = RPC to
be as large as possible. So, we take R = [x y z t] and look for values for x, y, z, and
t that make RPC as large as possible. First, we calculate e in terms of these unknowns:
e = RPC = [x
y
z
t]



= 1.5x −z + 2t
Now, the unknowns x, y, z, and t must be nonnegative and add up to 1 (why?). Because
t has the largest coefﬁcient, 2, we’ll get the best result by making it as large as possible,
namely, t = 1, leaving x = y = z = 0. Thus, RTV’s best strategy is R = [0 0 0 1].
In other words, RTV should use the pure strategy of showing a movie every Tuesday
evening. If it does so, the expected value will be 
e = 1.5(0) −0 + 2(1) = 2
so RTV can expect to gain 2000 viewers.
b. Here, we are given R = [0 0.50 0.50 0] and are not given CTV’s strategy C, so this
time we take C = [x y z t]T and calculate e:
e = RPC = [0

= −1.5x + 0.5y −0.5z + 1.5t
Now, CTV wants e to be as small as possible (why?). Because x has the largest nega-
tive coefﬁcient, CTV would like it to be as large as possible: x = 1, so the rest of the
unknowns must be zero Thus, CTV’s best strategy is C = [1 0 0 0]T , that is, show
a nature documentary every night. If it does so, the expected value will be 
e = −1.5(1) + 0.5(0) −0.5(0) + 1.5(0) = −1.5
so CTV can expect to gain 1500 viewers.
This example illustrates the fact that, no matter what mixed strategy one player
selects, the other player can choose an appropriate pure counterstrategy in order to max-
imize its gain. How does this affect what decisions you should make as one of the play-
ers? If you were on the board of directors of RTV, you might reason as follows: Since for
every mixed strategy you try, CTV can ﬁnd a best counterstrategy (as in part (b)) it is in
your company’s best interest to select a mixed strategy that minimizes the effect of
CTV’s best counterstrategy. This is called the minimax criterion.

This principle is not always followed by every player. For example, one of the play-
ers may be nature and may choose its move at random, with no particular purpose in
mind. In such a case, criteria other than the minimax criterion may be more appropriate.
For example, there is the “maximax” criterion, which maximizes the maximum possible
payoff (also known as the “reckless” strategy), or the criterion that seeks to minimize
“regret” (the difference between the payoff you get and the payoff you would have got-
ten if you had known beforehand what was going to happen).23 But, we shall assume here
the fundamental principle and try to ﬁnd optimal strategies under the minimax criterion.
Finding the optimal strategy is called solving the game. In general, solving a game
can be done using linear programming, as we shall see in the next chapter. However, we
can solve 2 × 2 games “by hand” as we shall see in the next example. First, we notice
that some large games can be reduced to smaller games.
Consider the game in the preceding example, which had the following matrix:
P =




Compare the second and third columns through the eyes of the column player, CTV.
Every payoff in the third column is as good as or better, from CTV’s point of view, than
the corresponding entry in the second column. Thus, no matter what RTV does, CTV
will do better showing a ballet (third column) than a symphony (second column). We say
that the third column dominates the second column. As far as CTV is concerned, we
might as well forget about symphonies entirely, so we remove the second column. Sim-
ilarly, the third column dominates the fourth, so we can remove the fourth column, too.
This gives us a smaller game to work with:

Matrix Algebra and Applications
Minimax Criterion
A player using the minimax criterion chooses a strategy that, among all possible strate-
gies, minimizes the effect of the other player’s best counterstrategy. That is, an optimal
(best) strategy according to the minimax criterion is one that minimizes the maximum
damage the opponent can cause.
Fundamental Principle of Game Theory
Each player tries to use its best possible strategy, and assumes that the other player is
doing the same.
This criterion assumes that your opponent is determined to win. More precisely, it
assumes the following.
23 See Location in Space: Theoretical Perspectives in Economic Geography, 3rd Edition, by Peter Dicken and
Peter E. Lloyd, HarperCollins Publishers, 1990, pp. 276 ff.

Now compare the ﬁrst and last rows. Every payoff in the last row is larger than the cor-
responding payoff in the ﬁrst row, so the last row is always better to RTV. Again, we say
that the last row dominates the ﬁrst row, and we can discard the ﬁrst row. Similarly, the
last row dominates the second row, so we discard the second row as well. This reduces
us to the following game:
P =

−2
0
3
−1

In this matrix, neither row dominates the other and neither column dominates the
other. So, this is as far as we can go with this line of argument. We call this reduction
by dominance.
3.4 Game Theory
215
Reduction by Dominance
One row dominates another if every entry in the former is greater than or equal to the
corresponding entry in the latter. Put another way, one row dominates another if it is
always at least as good for the row player.
One column dominates another if every entry in the former is less than or equal to the
corresponding entry in the latter. Put another way, one column dominates another if it is
always at least as good for the column player.
Procedure for Reducing by Dominance:
1. Check whether there is any row in the (remaining) matrix that is dominated by an-
other row. Remove all dominated rows.
2. Check whether there is any column in the (remaining) matrix that is dominated by
another column. Remove all dominated columns.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no dominated rows or columns.
Let us now go back to the “television ratings wars” example and see how we can
solve a game using the minimax criterion once we are down to a 2 × 2 payoff matrix.
Example 3 Solving a 2 × 2 Game
Continuing the preceding example:
a. Find the optimal strategy for RTV.
b. Find the optimal strategy for CTV.
c. Find the expected value of the game if RTV and CTV use their optimal 
strategies.
Solution As in the text, we begin by reducing the game by dominance, which brings
us down to the following 2 × 2 game:
CTV
Nature Doc.
Ballet

RTV
Reality Show

a. Now let’s ﬁnd RTV’s optimal strategy. Because we don’t yet know what it is, we
write down a general strategy:
R = [x
y]
Because x + y = 1, we can replace y by 1 −x:
R = [x
1 −x]
We know that CTV’s best counterstrategy to R will be a pure strategy (see the discus-
sion after Example 2), so let’s compute the expected value of the game for each of
CTV’s possible pure strategies:
e = [x
1 −x]




1 −x]

−2
0
3
−1

0
1

= 0x −(1 −x) = x −1
Because both e and f depend on x, we can graph them as in Figure 1.
If, for instance, RTV happened to choose x = 0.5, then the expected values for
CTV’s two pure strategies are e = −5(1/2) + 3 = 1/2 and f = 1/2 −1 = −1/2.The
worst outcome for RTV is the lower of the two, f, and this will be true wherever the graph
of f is below the graph of e. On the other hand, if RTV chose x = 1, the graph of e would
be lower and the worst possible expected value would be e = −5(1) + 3 = −2. Since
RTV can choose x to be any value between 0 and 1, the worst possible outcomes are
those shown by the orange portion of the graph in Figure 2.
Because RTV is trying to make the worst possible outcome as large as possible
(that is, to minimize damages), it is seeking the point on the orange portion of the
graph that is highest. This is the intersection point of the two lines. To calculate its
coordinates, it’s easiest to equate the two functions of x:
−5x + 3 = x −1,
−6x = −4,
or
x = 2
3
The e (or f ) coordinate is then obtained by substituting x = 2/3 into the expression
for e (or f ) giving:
e = −5
	2
3

+ 3
= −1
3
We conclude that RTV’s best strategy is to take x = 2/3, giving an expected value of
–1/3. In other words, RTV’s optimal mixed strategy is:
R =
 2
3
1
3

Going back to the original game, RTV should show reality shows 2/3 of the time and
movies 1/3 of the time. It should not bother showing any sitcoms or docudramas. It
expects to lose, on average, 333 viewers to CTV, but all of its other options are worse.

unknown strategy as follows.

As with the row player, we know that the column player’s best strategy will corre-
spond to the intersection of the graphs of e and f (Figure 3).
(Why is the upper edge orange, rather than the lower edge?) The graphs intersect
when
−2x = 4x −1
or
x = 1
6
The corresponding value of e (or f ) is
e = −2

Thus CTV’s optimal mixed strategy is

T and the expected value is –1/3.
So, CTV should show nature documentaries 1/6 of the time and ballets 5/6 of the
time. It should not bother to show symphonies or operas. It expects to gain, on average,
333 viewers from RTV.
c. We can now calculate the expected value of the game as usual, using the optimal
strategies we found in parts (a) and (b).

+Before we go on... In Example 3, it is no accident that the expected value with the op-
timal strategies equals the expected values we found in (a) and (b). If we call the ex-
pected value with the optimal strategies the expected value of the game, the row
player’s optimal strategy guarantees an average payoff no smaller than the expected
value, while the column player’s optimal strategy guarantees an average payoff no larger.
Together they force the average value to be the expected value of the game. ■

Q: What about games that don’t reduce to 2 × 2 matrices? Are these solved in a similar 
way?
A: The method illustrated in the above example cannot easily be generalized to solve bigger
games (i.e., games that cannot be reduced to 2 × 2 matrices); solving even a 2 × 3 game
using this approach would require us to consider graphs in three dimensions. To be able to
solve games of arbitrary size, we need to wait until the next chapter (Section 4.5) where we
describe a method for solving a game, using the simplex method, that works for all payoff
matrices. ■

Solution If we look carefully at this matrix, we see that no row dominates another and
no column dominates another, so we can’t reduce it. Nor do we know how to solve a
3 × 3 game, so it looks as if we’re stuck. However, there is a way to understand this par-
ticular game. With the minimax criterion in mind, let’s begin by considering the worst
possible outcomes for the row player for each possible move. We do this by circling the
smallest payoff in each row, the row minima:

The expected value of a game is its expected value when the row and column players
use their optimal (minimax) strategies. By using its optimal strategy, the row player guar-
antees an expected value no lower than the expected value of the game, no matter what
the column player does. Similarly, by using its optimal strategy, the column player guar-
antees an expected value no higher than the expected value of the game, no matter what
the row player does.

We do the same thing for the column player, remembering that smaller payoffs are
better for B and larger payoffs worse. We draw a box around the largest payoff in each
column, the column maxima:
B

A

u

Player B takes the least risk by using move q, which has the smallest column maximum.
Now put the circles and boxes together:

u

Notice that the uq entry is both circled and boxed: it is both a row minimum and a col-
umn maximum. We call such an entry a saddle point.
Now we claim that the optimal strategy for A is to always play u while the optimal
strategy for B is to always play q. By playing u, A guarantees that the payoff will be 0 or
higher, no matter what B does, so the expected value of the game has to be at least 0. On
the other hand, by playing q, B guarantees that the payoff will be 0 or less, so the ex-
pected value of the game has to be no more than 0. That means that the expected value
of the game must be 0, and A and B have no strategies that could do any better for them
than the pure strategies u and q.

Before we go on... You should consider what happens in an example like the television
rating wars game of Example 3. In that game, the largest row minimum is –1 while the
smallest column maximum is 0; there is no saddle point. The row player can force a pay-
off of at least –1 by playing a pure strategy (always showing movies, for example), but
can do better, forcing an average payoff of −1/3, by playing a mixed strategy. Similarly,
the column player can force the payoff to be 0 or less with a pure strategy, but can do bet-
ter, forcing an average payoff of −1/3, with a mixed strategy. Only when there is a sad-
dle point will pure strategies be optimal. ■

Strictly Determined Game
A saddle point is a payoff that is simultaneously a row minimum and a column maxi-
mum (both boxed and circled in our approach). If a game has a saddle point, the corre-
sponding row and column strategies are the optimal ones, and we say that the game is
strictly determined.

Solving a Game
Q: We’ve seen several ways of trying to solve a game. What should I do and in what order?
A: Here are the steps you should take when trying to solve a game:
1. Reduce by dominance. This should always be your first step.
2. If you were able to reduce to a 1 × 1 game, you’re done. The optimal strategies are the corre-
sponding pure strategies, as they dominate all the others.
3. Look for a saddle point in the reduced game. If it has one, the game is strictly determined,
and the corresponding pure strategies are optimal.
4. If your reduced game is 2 × 2 and has no saddle point, use the method of Example 3 to find
the optimal mixed strategies.
5. If your reduced game is larger than 2 × 2 and has no saddle point, you have to use linear pro-
gramming to solve it, but that will have to wait until the following chapter. ■

Set up the payoff matrix in each of Exercises 25–32.
25. ●Games to Pass the Time You and your friend have come up
with the following simple game to pass the time: at each
round, you simultaneously call “heads” or “tails.” If you have
both called the same thing, your friend wins one point; if your
calls differ, you win one point. 
26. ●Games to Pass the Time Bored with the game in Exercise
25, you decide to use the following variation instead: If you
both call “heads” your friend wins two points; if you both call
“tails” your friend wins 1 point; if your calls differ, then you
win two points if you called “heads,” and one point if you
called “tails.” 
27. ●War Games You are deciding whether to invade France,
Sweden or Norway, and your opponent is simultaneously
deciding which of these three countries to defend. If you invade
a country that your opponent is defending, you will be defeated
(payoff: −1), but if you invade a country your opponent is
not defending, you will be successful (payoff: +1).
28. ●War Games You must decide whether to attack your oppo-
nent by sea or air, and your opponent must simultaneously de-
cide whether to mount an all-out air defense, an all-out coastal
defense (against an attack from the sea) or a combined air and
coastal defense. If there is no defense for your mode of attack,
you win 100 points. If your attack is met by a shared air and
coastal defense, you win 50 points. If your attack is met by an
all-out defense, you lose 200 points.
29. Marketing Your fast-food outlet, Burger Queen, has obtained
a license to open branches in three closely situated South
African cities: Brakpan, Nigel, and Springs. Your market sur-
veys show that Brakpan and Nigel each provide a potential
market of 2000 burgers a day, while Springs provides a poten-
tial market of 1000 burgers per day. Your company can only
ﬁnance an outlet in one of those cities at the present time.
Your main competitor, Burger Princess, has also obtained li-
censes for these cities, and is similarly planning to open only
one outlet. If you both happen to locate at the same city, you
will share the total business from all three cities equally, but if
you locate in different cities, you will each get all the business
in the cities in which you have located, plus half the business
in the third city. The payoff is the number of burgers you will
sell per day minus the number of burgers your competitor will
sell per day. 
30. Marketing Repeat Exercise 29, given that the potential sales
markets in the three cities are: Brakpan, 2500 per day; Nigel,
1500 per day; Springs, 1200 per day. 
31. Betting When you bet on a racehorse with odds of m–n, you
stand to win m dollars for every bet of n dollars if your horse
wins; for instance, if the horse you bet is running at 5–2 and
wins, you will win $5 for every $2 you bet. (Thus a $2 bet
will return $7.). Here are some actual odds from a 1992 race
at Belmont Park, NY.24 The favorite at 5–2 was Pleasant Tap.
The second choice was Thunder Rumble at 7–2, while the
third choice was Strike the Gold at 4–1. Assume you are mak-
ing a $10 bet on one of these horses. The payoffs are your
winnings. (If your horse does not win, you lose your entire
bet. Of course, it is possible for none of your horses to win.)
32. Betting Referring to Exercise 31, suppose that just before the
race, there has been frantic betting on Thunder Rumble, with
the result that the odds have dropped to 2–5. The odds on the
other two horses remain unchanged. 
33. ●PriceWars Computer Electronics, Inc. (CE) and the Gigantic
Computer Store (GCS) are planning to discount the price they
charge for the HAL Laptop Computer, of which they are the
only distributors. Because Computer Electronics provides a
free warranty service, they can generally afford to charge
more. A market survey provides the following data on the

that the Japanese were planning to move a troop and supply
convoy from the port of Rabaul at the Eastern tip of New
Britain to Lae, which lies just west of New Britain on New
Guinea. It could either travel via a northern route which was
plagued by poor visibility, or by a southern route, where the
visibility was clear. General Kenney, who was the commander
of the Allied Air Forces in the area, had the choice of concen-
trating reconnaissance aircraft on one route or the other, and
bombing the Japanese convoy once it was sighted. Kenney’s

a. Use reduction by dominance to determine how much each

b. CE is aware that GCS is planning to use reduction of dom-
inance to determine its pricing policy, and wants its market
share to be as large as possible. What effect, if any, would
the information about GCS have on CE’s best strategy?
34. ● More Price Wars (Refer to Exercise 33) A new market sur-
vey results in the following revised data:
a. Use reduction by dominance to determine how much each
company should charge. What is the effect on CE’s mar-
ket share?
b. In general, why do price wars tend to force prices down?
35. ● Wrestling Tournaments City Community College (CCC)
plans to host Midtown Military Academy (MMA) for a
wrestling tournament. Each school has three wrestlers in the
190 lb. weight class: CCC has Pablo, Sal, and Edison, while
MMA has Carlos, Marcus and Noto. Pablo can beat Carlos and
Marcus, Marcus can beat Edison and Sal, Noto can beat Edi-
son, while the other combinations will result in an even match.
Set up a payoff matrix, and use reduction by dominance to de-
cide which wrestler each team should choose as their cham-
pion. Does one school have an advantage over the other?
36. ● Wrestling Tournaments (Refer to Exercise 35) One day be-
fore the wrestling tournament discussed in Exercise 35,
Pablo sustains a hamstring injury, and is replaced by Hans,
who (unfortunately for CCC) can be beaten by both Carlos
and Marcus. Set up the payoff matrix, and use reduction by
dominance to decide which wrestler each team should
choose as their champion. Does one school have an advan-
tage over the other?

40. More Prisoners’ Dilemmas Jane Good and Prudence Brown
have been arrested for robbery, but the police lack sufﬁcient
evidence for a conviction, and so decide to interrogate them
separately in the hope of extracting a confession. Both Jane
and Prudence are told the following: if they both confess,
they will each receive a ﬁve-year sentence; if neither con-
fesses, they will be released; if one confesses, she will
receive a suspended sentence, while the other will receive a
ten-year sentence. What should Jane do? 
41. Campaign Strategies27 Florida and Ohio are “swing states”
that have a large bounty of electoral votes and are therefore
highly valued by presidential campaign strategists. Suppose
it is now the weekend before Election Day 2004, and each
candidate (Bush and Kerry) can visit only one more state.
Further, to win the election, Bush needs to win both of these
states. Currently Bush has a 40% chance of winning Ohio
and a 60% chance of winning Florida. Therefore, he has a
0.40 × 0.60 = 0.24, or 24% chance of winning the election.
Assume that each candidate can increase his probability of
winning a state by 10% if he, and not his opponent, visits that
state. If both candidates visit the same state, there is no effect.
a. Set up a payoff matrix with Bush as the row player and
Kerry as the column player, where the payoff for a spe-
ciﬁc set of circumstances is the probability (expressed as
a percentage) that Bush will win both states.
b. Where should each candidate visit under the circum-
stances?  
42. Campaign Strategies Repeat Exercise 41, this time assuming
that Bush has an 80% chance of winning Ohio and a 90%
chance of winning Florida.

crom A is about to launch either a 30% off everything sale or

a line of torn gym shirts and a more daring line of “empty

veal that there is a 20% chance that Abercrom A will opt for
the empty shirt option. The following payoff matrix gives the

45. ● Factory Location28 A manufacturer of electrical machin-
ery is located in a cramped, though low-rent, factory close to
the center of a large city. The ﬁrm needs to expand, and it
could do so in one of three ways: (1) remain where it is and
install new equipment, (2) move to a suburban site in the
same city, or (3) relocate in a different part of the country
where labor is cheaper. Its decision will be inﬂuenced by the
fact that one of the following will happen: (I) the government
may introduce a program of equipment grants, (II) a new sub-
urban highway may be built, or (III) the government may in-
stitute a policy of ﬁnancial help to companies who move into
regions of high unemployment. The value to the company of
each combination is given in the following payoff matrix.

47. ● Study Techniques Your mathematics test is tomorrow, and
will cover the following topics: game theory, linear program-
ming, and matrix algebra. You have decided to do an “all-
nighter” and must determine how to allocate your eight hours
of study time among the three topics. If you were to spend the
entire eight hours on any one of these topics (thus using a
pure strategy) you feel conﬁdent that you would earn a 90%
score on that portion of the test, but would not do so well on
the other topics. You have come up with the following table,
where the entries are your expected scores. (The fact that lin-
ear programming and matrix algebra are used in game theory
is reﬂected in these numbers).

You have been told that the test will be weighted as fol-
lows: game theory: 25%; linear programming: 50%; matrix
algebra: 25%.

49. Staff Cutbacks Frank Tempest manages a large snowplow ser-
vice in Manhattan, Kansas, and is alarmed by the recent
weather trends; there have been no signiﬁcant snowfalls since
1993. He is therefore contemplating laying off some of his
workers, but is unsure about whether to lay off 5, 10 or 15 of
his 50 workers. Being very methodical, he estimates his an-
nual net proﬁts based on four possible annual snowfall ﬁg-
ures: 0 inches, 20 inches, 40 inches and 60 inches. (He takes
into account the fact that, if he is running a small operation in
the face of a large annual snowfall, he will lose business to his
competitors because he will be unable to discount on volume.)

48. ● Study Techniques Your friend Joe has been spending all of
his time in fraternity activities, and thus knows absolutely
nothing about any of the three topics on tomorrow’s math
test. (See Exercise 47.) Because you are recognized as an ex-
pert on the use of game theory to solve study problems, he
has turned to you for advice as to how to spend his “all-
nighter.” As the following table shows, his situation is not so
rosy. (Since he knows no linear programming or matrix alge-
bra, the table shows, for instance, that studying game theory
all night will not be much use in preparing him for this topic.)
a. During the past 10 years, the region has had 0 inches
twice, 20 inches twice, 40 inches 3 times, and 60 inches
3 times. Based on this information, how many workers
should Tempest lay off, and how much would it cost 
him?
b. There is a 50% chance that Tempest will lay off 5 workers
and a 50% chance that he will lay off 15 workers. What is
the worst thing Nature can do to him in terms of snow-
fall? How much would it cost him?

Tempest, being somewhat paranoid, suspects it too. What

50. Textbook WritingYou are writing a college-level textbook on
ﬁnite mathematics, and are trying to come up with the best
combination of word problems. Over the years, you have ac-
cumulated a collection of amusing problems, serious applica-
tions, long complicated problems, and “generic” problems.30
Before your book is published, it must be scrutinized by sev-
eral reviewers who, it seems, are never satisﬁed with the mix
you use. You estimate that there are three kinds of reviewers:
the “no-nonsense” types who prefer applications and generic
problems, the “dead serious” types, who feel that a college-
level text should be contain little or no humor and lots of long
complicated problems, and the “laid-back” types, who be-
lieve that learning best takes place in a light-hearted atmos-
phere bordering on anarchy. You have drawn up the following
chart, where the payoffs represent the reactions of reviewers
on a scale of −10 (ballistic) to +10 (ecstatic):

other hand, it devoted its entire budget to WASH ads, it would
neither increase nor decrease revenues in the event that
Splish was running all its ads on the more popular WISH, and
would in fact lose $20,000 in revenues if Splish ran its ads on
WASH. What should Softex do, and what effect will this have
on revenues? 
52. ● Labor NegotiationsThe management team of the Abstract
Concrete Company is negotiating a three-year contract with
the labor unions at one of its plants, and is trying to decide on
its offer for a salary increase. If it offers a 5% increase and
the unions accept the offer, Abstract Concrete will gain $20
million in projected proﬁts in the coming year, but if labor re-
jects the offer, the management team predicts that it will be
forced to increase the offer to the union demand of 15%, thus
halving the projected proﬁts. If Abstract Concrete offers a
15% increase, the company will earn $10 million in proﬁts
over the coming year if the unions accept. If the unions reject,
they will probably go out on strike (because management has
set 15% as its upper limit) and management has decided that
it can then in fact gain $12 million in proﬁts by selling out the
defunct plant in retaliation. What intermediate percentage
should the company offer, and what proﬁt should it project?

Input-Output Models
In this section we look at an application of matrix algebra developed by Wassily Leontief
(1906–1999) in the middle of the twentieth century. In 1973, he won the Nobel Prize in
Economics for this work. The application involves analyzing national and regional
economies by looking at how various parts of the economy interrelate. We’ll work out
some of the details by looking at a simple scenario.
First, we can think of the economy of a country or a region as being composed of
various sectors, or groups of one or more industries. Typical sectors are the manufactur-
ing sector, the utilities sector, and the agricultural sector. To introduce the basic concepts,
we shall consider two speciﬁc sectors: the coal-mining sector (Sector 1) and the electric
utilities sector (Sector 2). Both produce a commodity: the coal-mining sector produces
coal, and the electric utilities sector produces electricity. We measure these products by
their dollar value. By one unit of a product, we mean $1 worth of that product.
Here is the scenario.
1. To produce one unit ($1 worth) of coal, assume that the coal-mining sector uses 50¢
worth of coal (to power mining machinery, say) and 10¢ worth of electricity.
2. To produce one unit ($1 worth) of electricity, assume that the electric utilities sector
uses 25¢ worth of coal and 25¢ worth of electricity.
These are internal usage ﬁgures. In addition to this, assume that there is an external de-
mand (from the rest of the economy) of 7000 units ($7,000 worth) of coal and 14,000
units ($14,000 worth) of electricity over a speciﬁc time period (one year, say). Our basic
question is: How much should each of the two sectors supply in order to meet both in-
ternal and external demand?
The key to answering this question is to set up equations of the form:
Total supply = Total demand
The unknowns, the values we are seeking, are
x1 = the total supply (in units) from Sector 1 (coal) and
x2 = the total supply (in units) from Sector 2 (electricity)

Our equations then take the following form:
Total supply from Sector 1 = Total demand for Sector 1 products
x1 = 0.50x1

0.25x2

This is a system of two linear equations in two unknowns:
x1 = 0.50x1 + 0.25x2 + 7000
x2 = 0.10x1 + 0.25x2 + 14,000
We can rewrite this system of equations in matrix form as follows:

is called the technology matrix. The entries of the technology matrix have the follow-
ing meanings:
a11 = units of Sector 1 needed to produce one unit of Sector 1
a12 = units of Sector 1 needed to produce one unit of Sector 2
a21 = units of Sector 2 needed to produce one unit of Sector 1
a22 = units of Sector 2 needed to produce one unit of Sector 2
You can remember this order by the slogan “In the side, out the top.”
Now that we have the matrix equation
X = AX + D
3.5 Input-Output Models
227

we can solve it as follows. First, subtract AX from both sides:
X −AX = D
Because X = I X, where I is the 2 × 2 identity matrix, we can rewrite this as
I X −AX = D
Now factor out X:
(I −A)X = D
If we multiply both sides by the inverse of (I −A), we get the solution
X = (I −A)−1D

Input-Output Model
In an input-output model, an economy (or part of one) is divided into n sectors. We then
record the n × n technology matrix A, whose ijth entry is the number of units from
Sector i used in producing one unit from Sector j (“in the side, out the top”). To meet
an external demand of D, the economy must produce X, where X is the production
vector. These are related by the equations
X = AX + D

X = (I −A)−1D

In other words, to meet the demand, the economy must produce $25,000 worth of coal
and $22,000 worth of electricity.
The next example uses actual data from the U.S. economy (we have rounded the
ﬁgures to make the computations less complicated). It is rare to ﬁnd input-output data
already packaged for you as a technology matrix. Instead, the data commonly found in
statistical sources come in the form of “input-output tables,” from which we will have to
construct the technology matrix.

Example 1 Petroleum and Natural Gas
Consider two sectors of the U.S. economy: crude petroleum and natural gas (crude)
and petroleum refining and related industries (refining). According to government
figures,* in 1998 the crude sector used $27,000 million worth of its own products and
$750 million worth of the products of the reﬁning sector to produce $87,000 million
worth of goods (crude oil and natural gas). The reﬁning sector in the same year used
$59,000 million worth of the products of the crude sector and $15,000 million worth of
its own products to produce $140,000 million worth of goods (reﬁned oil and the like).
What was the technology matrix for these two sectors? What was left over from each of
these sectors for use by other parts of the economy or for export?
Solution First, for convenience, we record the given data in the form of a table, called
the input-output table. (All ﬁgures are in millions of dollars.)
* The data have been rounded to two signiﬁcant digits. SOURCE: Survey of Current Business, December, 2001,
U.S. Department of Commerce. The Survey of Current Business and the input-output tables themselves are avail-
able at the website of the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.bea.gov.

The entries in the top portion are arranged in the same way as those of the technology
matrix: The ijth entry represents the number of units of Sector i that went to Sector j.
Thus, for instance, the 59,000 million entry in the 1, 2 position represents the number of
units of Sector 1, crude, that were used by Sector 2, reﬁning. (“In the side, out the top”.)
We now construct the technology matrix. The technology matrix has entries
ai j = units of Sector i used to produce one unit of Sector j. Thus,
a11 = units of crude to produce one unit of crude. We are told that 27,000
million units of crude were used to produce 87,000 million units of crude.
Thus, to produce one unit of crude, 27,000/87,000 ≈0.31 units of crude
were used, and so a11 ≈0.31. (We have rounded this value to two signiﬁcant
digits; further digits are not reliable due to rounding of the original data.)
a12 = units of crude to produce one unit of reﬁned: 
a12 = 59,000/140,000 ≈0.42
a21 = units of reﬁned to produce one unit of crude: 
a21 = 750/87,000 ≈0.0086
a22 = units of reﬁned to produce one unit of reﬁned: 
a22 = 15,000/140,000 ≈0.11
This gives the technology matrix

In short we obtained the technology matrix from the input-output table by dividing the
Sector 1 column by the Sector 1 total, and the Sector 2 column by the Sector 2 total.

side economy. To ﬁnd D, we use the equation

We rounded to 2 digits†
The ﬁrst number, $1000 million, is the amount produced by the crude sector that is
available to be used by other parts of the economy or to be exported. (In fact, because
something has to happen to all that crude petroleum and natural gas, this is the amount
actually used or exported, where use can include stockpiling.) The second number,
$124,000 million, represents the amount produced by the reﬁning sector that is avail-
able to be used by other parts of the economy or to be exported. Complete the exam-
ple using a TI-83/84 or Excel.
Note that we could have calculated D more simply from the input-output table. The
internal use of units from the crude sector was the sum of the outputs from that sector:
27,000 + 59,000 = 86,000
Because 87,000 units were actually produced by the sector, that left a surplus of $87,000 –
86,000 = 1000 units for export. We could compute the surplus from the reﬁning sector
similarly. (The two calculations actually come out slightly different, because we
rounded the intermediate results.) The calculation in Example 2 below cannot be done
as trivially, however.

Input-Output Table
National economic data are often given in the form of an input-output table. The ijth
entry in the top portion of the table is the number of units that go from Sector i to Sector j.
The “Total outputs” are the total numbers of units produced by each sector. We obtain
the technology matrix from the input-output table by dividing the Sector 1 column by the
Sector 1 total, the Sector 2 column by the Sector 2 total, and so on.

Suppose that external demand for reﬁned petroleum rises to $200,000 million, but the
demand for crude remains $1000 million (as in Example 1). How do the production levels
of the two sectors considered in Example 1 have to change?
Solution We are being told that now
D =

(As in Example 1, we have rounded all the entries in the answer to two signiﬁcant digits.)
Comparing this vector to the production vector used in Example 1, we see that pro-
duction in the crude sector has to increase from $87,000 million to $140,000 million,
while production in the reﬁning sector has to increase from $140,000 million to
$230,000 million.
* Since A is accurate to two digits, we should use more than two signiﬁcant digits in intermediate calculations
so as not to lose additional accuracy. We must, of course, round the ﬁnal answer to two digits.
Note Using the matrix (I −A)−1, we have a slightly different way of solving Example 2.
We are asking for the effect on production of a change in the ﬁnal demand of 0 for
crude and $200,000 – 124,000 = $76,000 million for reﬁned products. If we multiply
(I −A)−1 by the matrix representing this change, we obtain

(I −A)−1× Change in Demand = Change in Production
We see the changes required in production: an increase of $53,000 million in the crude
sector and an increase of $90,000 million in the reﬁning sector.

Notice that the increase in external demand for the products of the reﬁning sector
requires the crude sector to also increase production, even though there is no increase
in the external demand for its products. The reason is that, in order to increase produc-
tion, the reﬁning sector needs to use more crude oil, so that the internal demand for
crude oil goes up. The inverse matrix (I −A)−1 takes these indirect effects into ac-
count in a nice way.
By replacing the $76,000 by $1 in the computation we just did, we see that a $1 in-
crease in external demand for reﬁned products will require an increase in production of
$0.6880 in the crude sector, as well as an increase in production of $1.130 in the reﬁn-
ing sector. This is how we interpret the entries in (I −A)−1, and this is why it is useful
to look at this matrix inverse rather than just solve (I −A)X = D for X using, say,
Gauss-Jordan reduction. Looking at (I −A)−1, we can also ﬁnd the effects of an in-
crease of $1 in external demand for crude: an increase in production of $1.458 in the
crude sector and an increase of $0.01409 in the reﬁning sector.
Here are some questions to think about: Why are the diagonal entries of (I −A)−1
(slightly) larger than 1? Why is the entry in the lower left so small compared to the 
others? ■

Interpreting (I −A)−1: Indirect Effects
If A is the technology matrix, then the ijth entry of (I −A)−1 is the change in the num-
ber of units Sector i must produce in order to meet a one-unit increase in external de-
mand for Sector j products. To meet a rising external demand, the necessary change in
production for each sector is given by
Change in production = (I −A)−1D+
where D+ is the change in external demand.
Take Sector 1 to be skateboards, and Sector 2 to be wood, and assume that
(I −A)−1 =

1.1
0
0.6
1.1

Then
a11 = 1.1 = number of additional units of skateboards that must be produced
to meet a one-unit increase in the demand for skateboards (Why is this number
larger than 1?)
a12 = 0 = number of additional units of skateboards that must be produced to
meet a one-unit increase in the demand for wood (why is this number 0?)
a21 = 0.6 = number of additional units of wood that must be produced to
meet a one-unit increase in the demand for skateboards
a22 = 1.1 = number of additional units of wood that must be produced to
meet a one-unit increase in the demand for wood
To meet an increase in external demand of 100 skateboards and 400 units of wood, the
necessary change in production is
(I −A)−1D+ =

so 110 additional skateboards and 500 additional units of wood will need to be produced.

In the preceding examples, we used only two sectors of the economy. The data
used in Examples 1 and 2 were taken from an input-output table published by the U.S.
Department of Commerce, in which the whole U.S. economy was broken down into
85 sectors. This in turn was a simpliﬁed version of a model in which the economy was
broken into about 500 sectors. Obviously, computers are required to make a realistic
input-output analysis possible. Many governments collect and publish input-output
data as part of their national planning. The United Nations collects these data and
publishes collections of national statistics. The U.N. also has a useful set of links to
government statistics at the following URL:

Example 3 Kenya Economy
Consider four sectors of the economy of Kenya:* (1) the traditional economy, (2) agri-
culture, (3) manufacture of metal products and machinery, and (4) wholesale and retail
trade. The input-output table for these four sectors for 1976 looks like this (all numbers
are 1000s of K£):
* Figures are rounded. SOURCE: Input-Output Tables for Kenya 1976, Central Bureau of Statistics of the
Ministry of Economic Planning and Community Affairs, Kenya.

Suppose that external demand for agriculture increased by K£50,000,000 and that external
demand for metal products and machinery increased by K£10,000,000. How would pro-
duction in these four sectors have to change to meet this rising demand?
Solution To ﬁnd the change in production necessary to meet the rising demand, we
need to use the formula
Change in production = (I −A)−1D+
where A is the technology matrix and D+ is the change in demand:
D+ =


Looking at this result, we see that the changes in external demand will leave the tradi-
tional economy unaffected, production in agriculture will rise by K£52 million, produc-
tion in the manufacture of metal products and machinery will rise by K£12 million, and
activity in wholesale and retail trade will rise by K£1.5 million.
+Before we go on... Can you see why the traditional economy was unaffected in Exam-
ple 3? Although it takes inputs from other parts of the economy, it is not itself an input
to any other part. In other words, there is no intermediate demand for the products of the
traditional economy coming from any other part of the economy, and so an increase in
production in any other sector of the economy will require no increase from the tradi-
tional economy. On the other hand, the wholesale and retail trade sector does provide
input to the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, so increases in those sectors do re-
quire an increase in the trade sector.
One more point: Notice how small the off-diagonal entries in (I −A)−1 are. This
says that increases in each sector have relatively small effects on the other sectors. We
say that these sectors are loosely coupled. Regional economies, where many products
are destined to be shipped out to the rest of the country, tend to show this phenomenon
even more strongly. Notice in Example 2 that those two sectors are strongly coupled,
because a rise in demand for reﬁned products requires a comparable rise in the pro-
duction of crude.■

rism by faculty members (who seem to have astute memo-
ries), each paper is given to students or used by the clubs only
once (no copies are kept). The number of papers that were

An input-output model divides an
economy into sectors. The technology

July Sales (Projected)
30. Inventory It is now July 15. Based on July sales to date, the
e-commerce manager projects July sales as follows:
Assuming that sales continue at this level for the next few
months, write down a matrix equation showing the inventory
N at each warehouse x months after July 1 (assuming no new
books are ordered during that period).
31. Revenue It is now the end of July and OHaganBooks.com’s e-
commerce manager bursts into the CEO’s ofﬁce. “I thought
you might want to know, John, that our sales ﬁgures are ex-
actly what I projected two weeks ago (see Exercise 30). Is that
good market analysis or what?” OHaganBooks.com has
charged an average of $5 for romance novels, $6 for science
ﬁction novels, and $5.50 for horror novels. Use the projected
sales ﬁgures from Exercise 30 and matrix arithmetic to com-
pute the total revenue OHaganBooks.com earned at each
warehouse in July.
32. Revenue OHaganBooks.com pays an average of $2 for ro-
mance novels, $3.50 for science ﬁction novels, and $1.50 for
horror novels. Use this information together with the informa-
tion in Exercise 31 to compute the proﬁt OHaganBooks.com
earned from sales of these books at each warehouse in July.
OHaganBooks.com has two main competitors: JungleBooks.com
and FarmerBooks.com, and no other competitors of any signiﬁ-
cance on the horizon. Exercises 33–35 are based on the following
table, which shows the movement of customers during July.41
(Thus, for instance, the ﬁrst row tells us that 80 percent of
OHaganBooks.com’s customers remained loyal, 10 percent of
them went to JungleBooks.com, and the remaining 10 percent to
FarmerBooks.com.)
41 By a “customer” of one of the three e-commerce sites, we mean some-
one who purchases more at that site than at any of the two competitors.

At the beginning of July, OHaganBooks.com had an estimated
2000 customers, while its two competitors had 4000 each.
33. Competition Set up the July 1 customer numbers in a row ma-
trix, and use matrix arithmetic to estimate the number of cus-
tomers each company has at the end of July.
29. Inventory Use matrix algebra to compute the inventory at
each warehouse at the end of June.

34. Competition Assuming the July trends continue in August,
predict the number of customers each company will have at
the end of August.
35. Competition Name one or more important factors that the
model we have used in this question does not take into account.
Acting on a “tip” from Marjory Dufﬁn, John O’Hagan decided
that his company should invest a signiﬁcant sum in the stock of
publisher Dufﬁn House. Exercises 36 and 37 are based on the fol-
lowing table, which shows what information he pieced together
later, after some of the records had been lost.
39. Competition After a very expensive dinner at an exclusive
restaurant, Marjory suddenly “remembers” that the Jungle-
Books CEO mentioned to her (at a less expensive restaurant)
that there is only a 20 percent chance JungleBooks will
launch a “2 for the price of 1” promotion, and a 40 percent
chance that it will launch a “3 for the price of 2” promotion.
What should you do in view of this new information, and
what will the expected effect be on your customer base?
40. Competition You are about to go with the option chosen in
the preceding exercise when one of your corporate spies
reveals that Marjory Dufﬁn has just been seen at the lavish
Donald Club 8000 in earnest conversation with JungleBooks
CEO François Dubois. All bets are off; you can assume now
that JungleBooks knows what options you’re considering
and knows the payoff matrix above. Now what should you 
do, and how many customers should you expect to gain or
lose?
Some of the books sold by OHaganBooks.com are printed at
Bruno Mills, Inc., a combined paper mill and printing company.
Exercises 41–44 are based on the following typical monthly
input-output table for Bruno Mills’ paper and book printing
sectors.

Over the three months shown, the company invested a total of
$50,000 in Dufﬁn stock, and, on August 15, was paid dividends of
10¢ per share, for a total of $300.
36. Investments Use matrix inversion to determine how many
shares OHaganBooks.com purchased on each of the three
dates shown.
37. Investments (Refer to Exercise 36.) On October 1, the shares
purchased on July 1 were sold at $3 per share. The remaining
shares were sold one month later at $1 per share. Use matrix
algebra to determine the total loss (taking into account the
dividends paid on August 15) incurred as a result of the Duf-
ﬁn stock ﬁasco.
Publisher Marjory Dufﬁn reveals that JungleBooks may be
launching a promotional scheme in which it will offer either two
books for the price of one, or three books for the price of two
(Marjory can’t quite seem to remember which, and is not certain
whether they will go with the scheme at all). Your marketing ad-
visers Floody and O’Lara seem to have different ideas as to how
to respond. Floody suggests you counter by offering three books
for the price of one, while O’Lara suggests that you instead offer
a free copy of the “Finite Mathematics Student Solutions
Manual” with every purchase. After a careful analysis, you come
up with the following payoff matrix, where the payoffs represent
the number of customers, in thousands, you expect to gain from
JungleBooks.

CAS E  STU DY :  The Japanese Economy
A senator walks into your cubicle in the Congressional
Budget Ofﬁce. “Look here,” she says, “I don’t see why
the Japanese trade representative is getting so upset
with my proposal to cut down on our use of Japanese
ﬁnance and insurance. He claims that it’ll hurt Japan’s
mining operations. But just look at Japan’s input-
output table. The ﬁnance sector doesn’t use any input
from the mining sector. How can our cutting back on
ﬁnance and insurance hurt mining?” Indeed, the
senator is right about the input-output table, which
you have hanging on your wall. Here is what it looks like (all ﬁgures are in 100 mil-
lion yen):42

The total output from each sector is given in the following table:

Chapter 3
Matrix Algebra and Applications
“If I look at just the mining and ﬁnance sectors,” says the senator, “I’m looking at this
input-output table.”
“That gives me
A =

0.0025
0
0.0442
0.0973

and so
(I −A)−1 =

1.0025
0
0.0491
1.1078

That last column tells me that any change in demand for ﬁnance will have no effect on
demand for mining.”
Now you have to explain to the senator a point that we fudged a bit in Section 3.5.
What she said assumes that changing the external demand for ﬁnance (that is, the de-
mand from outside of these two sectors) will not change the external demand for min-
ing. But in fact, that is unlikely to be true. Changing the demand for ﬁnance will change
the demand for other sectors in the economy directly (the manufacturing sector, for ex-
ample), which in turn may change the demand for mining. To see these indirect effects
properly, you tell the senator that she must look at the whole Japanese economy. The
technology matrix A is then

You tell the senator to look at the 7th column to see the effects of a change in demand
for ﬁnance. There is indeed an effect on mining: Every 1 yen increase in demand for ﬁ-
nance produces a 0.002844 yen increase in demand for mining. This also means that
every 1 yen decrease in demand for ﬁnance produces a 0.002844 yen decrease in de-
mand for mining. So the Japanese trade representative is right to complain that the sen-
ator’s plan will hurt their mining companies.
Exercises
1. What does the (2, 7) entry in the matrix A tell you?
2. What does the (2, 7) entry in the matrix (I −A)−1 tell you?
3. Why are none of the entries of (I −A)−1 negative?
4. Why are the diagonal entries of (I −A)−1 close to, and larger than, 1?
5. An increase in demand for the products of which sector of the Japanese economy
would have the least impact on the mining sector?
6. An increase in demand for the products of which sector of the Japanese economy
would have the most impact on the mining sector?
7. Which sector of the Japanese economy has the greatest percentage of its total output
available for external consumption?
8. Referring to the conclusion of this section, try to account for most of the 0.002844
yen by looking at the technology matrix A. For example, a 1 yen increase in demand
for ﬁnance produces directly a 0.036648 yen increase in demand for manufacturing,
which in turn produces a (0.036648)(0.016851) = 0.000618 yen increase in demand
for mining. What other two-step effects are there? Do they account for all of the
0.002844 yen?
9. Explain why A2 gives you the total two-step effects of increases in each sector on the
others. What about three-step effects? How do you see all of the direct and indirect
effects?

Solution with Technology On the TI-83/84, the format for
multiplying matrices is the same as for multiplying numbers:
[A][B] or [A] * [B] will give the product. Because we can’t
use P and Q as names of matrices on the TI-83/84, we’ll

What was the technology matrix for these two sectors?
What was left over from each of these sectors for use by
other parts of the economy or for export?
Solution with Technology There are several ways to use
these data to create the technology matrix in your TI-83/84.
For small matrices like this, the most straightforward is to
use the matrix editor, where you can give each entry as the
appropriate quotient:

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
and so on. Once we have the technology matrix [A] and
the production vector [B] (remember that we can’t use [X]
as a matrix name), we can calculate the external demand
vector:
Of course, when interpreting these numbers, we must re-
member to round to two signiﬁcant digits, because our
original data were accurate to only that many digits.
Here is an alternative way to calculate the technology
matrix that may be better for examples with more sectors. 
1. Begin by entering the columns of the input-output table
as lists in the list editor (
EDIT).
2. We now want to divide each column by the total output
of its sector and assemble the results into a matrix. We
can do this using the List
matr function (under the
MATH menu) as follows:
Example 3 Consider four sectors of the economy of
Kenya:43 (1) the traditional economy, (2) agriculture, (3)
manufacture of metal products and machinery, and (4)

Suppose that external demand for agriculture increased by
K£50,000,000 and that external demand for metal products
and machinery increased by K£10,000,000. How would
production in these four sectors have to change to meet this
rising demand?
Solution with Technology
1. Enter the technology matrix [A] using one of the tech-
niques above. 
2. Enter the matrix D+ as [D].
3. You can then compute the change in production with the
following formula:

Section 3.1
To enter a matrix in a spreadsheet, we put its entries in
any convenient block of cells. For example, the matrix A
in the ﬁrst Quick Example of this section might look like
this:
Excel refers to such blocks of data as arrays, which it can
handle in much the same way as it handles single cells of
data. For instance, when typing a formula, just as clicking
on a cell creates a reference to that cell, selecting a whole
array of cells will create a reference to that array. An array
is referred to using an array range consisting of the top-
left and bottom-right cell coordinates, separated by a
colon. For example, the array range A1:C2 refers to the
2 × 3 matrix above, with top-left corner A1 and bottom-
right corner C2.
Example 2 The A-Plus auto parts store chain has two out-
lets, one in Vancouver and one in Quebec. Among other
things, it sells wiper blades, windshield cleaning ﬂuid, and
ﬂoor mats. The monthly sales of these items at the two stores
for two months are given in the following tables:
Solution with Technology
1. To add or subtract two matrices in Excel, ﬁrst input their

2. Select (highlight) a block of the same size (3 × 2 in this
case) where you would like the answer, F −J, to appear,
enter the formula =B9:C11-B3:C5, and then type
Control+Shift+Enter. The easiest way to do this is as
follows:
• Highlight cells B15:C17.
Where you want the 
answer to appear
• Type “=”.
• Highlight the matrix F.
Cells B9 through C11
• Type “-”.
• Highlight the matrix J.
Cells B3 through C5
• Type Control+Shift+Enter.
Not just Enter
Use matrix arithmetic to calculate the change in sales of
each product in each store from January to February.

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
Typing Control+Shift+Enter (instead of Enter) tells Excel
that your formula is an array formula, one that returns a
matrix rather than a single number.44 Once entered, the for-
mula bar will show the formula you entered enclosed in
“curly braces,” indicating that it is an array formula. Note
that you must use Control+Shift+Enter to delete any array
you create: select the block you wish to delete and press
Delete followed by Control+Shift+Enter.
Example 3 The revenue generated by sales in the Van-
couver and Quebec branches of the A-Plus auto parts store
was as follows:
shown below.) Then type the formula =TRANSPOSE
(A1:C2) (use the array range appropriate for the matrix
you want to transpose) in the formula bar and press Control+
Shift+Enter. The easiest way to do this is as follows:
1. Highlight Cells A4:B6. The 3 × 2 block for the answer
2. Type “=TRANSPOSE(”.
3. Highlight the matrix you want to transpose.

January Sales in Canadian Dollars
If the Canadian dollar was worth $0.65U.S. at the time,
compute the revenue in U.S. dollars.
Solution with Technology Scalar multiplication is done in
Excel in much the same way we did matrix addition above:
As with matrix addition, we use Control+Shift+Enter to
evaluate scalar multiplication (or to evaluate any formula
that uses an array).
Transposition To transpose a matrix in Excel, ﬁrst highlight
the block where you would like the transpose to appear
(shaded in the spreadsheet below). (Note that it should have
the correct dimensions for the transpose: 3 × 2 in the case
44 Note that on a Macintosh, Command-Enter has the same effect as
Control+Shift+Enter.

The store sells wiper blades for $7.00 each, cleaning ﬂuid
for $3.00 per bottle, and ﬂoor mats for $12.00 each. Use
matrix multiplication to ﬁnd the total revenue generated by
sales of these items.
Solution with Technology In Excel, the formula for ma-
trix multiplication is MMULT. (Ordinary multiplication, *,
will not work.)
1. To ﬁnd the product P Q of a row and a column in
Excel, ﬁrst enter the matrices P and Q anywhere in the
spreadsheet.
2. Select the cell where you would like the result to appear
(G1 in the example shown below), and use MMULT as
shown. (Because the product occupies only a single cell,
it is not necessary to press Control+Shift+Enter, but it
won’t hurt.)

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
As usual, you can use the mouse to avoid typing the array ranges:
1. Click on cell G1.
2. Type “=MMULT(”.
3. Highlight the matrix P.

Example 6—Identity Matrix There is no function in Excel that returns an identity matrix. If you need a small identity
matrix, it’s simplest to just enter the 1s and 0s by hand. If you need a large identity matrix, here is one way to get it quickly.
1. Say we want a 4 × 4 identity matrix in the cells B1:E4. Enter the following formula in cell B1:
=IF(ROW(B1)-ROW($B$1)=COLUMN(B1)-COLUMN($B$1),1,0)
2. Press Enter, then copy cell B1 to cells B1:E4. The formula will return 1 along the diagonal of the matrix and 0s else-
where, giving you the identity matrix. Why does this formula work?

1. Enter the matrices A and B from the matrix equation AX = B.
2. Select a 3 × 1 block of cells for the matrix X.
3. The Excel formula we can use to calculate X is

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
(As usual, use the mouse to select the ranges for A and B while typing the formula, and don’t forget to press
Control+Shift+Enter.) Having obtained the solution to part (a), you can now simply modify the entries in Column E to see
the solutions for parts (b) and (c).
Note Your spreadsheet for part (a) may look like this:

What is that strange number doing in cell A6? “E-16”  represents “×10−16”, so the entry is really
1.11022 × 10−16 = 0.000 000 000 000 000 111022 ≈0
Mathematically, it is supposed to be exactly zero (see the solution to part (a) in the text) but Excel made a small error in
computing the inverse of A, resulting in this spurious value. Note, however, that it is accurate (agrees with zero) to 15 dec-
imal places! In practice, when we see numbers arise in matrix calculations that are far smaller than all the other entries,
we can usually assume they are supposed to be zero. ■

Solution with Technology
1. Enter the input-output table in a spreadsheet:

Chapter 3
Matrix Algebra and Applications
2. To obtain the technology matrix, we divide each column by the total output of its sector:
The formula =C3/C$5 is copied into the shaded 2 × 2 block shown \ on the left. (The $ sign in front of the 5 forces the
program to always divide by the total in Row 5 even when the formula is copied from Row 7 to Row 8. The result is the
technology matrix shown on the right.
3. Using the techniques discussed in the second section, we can now compute D = X −AX to ﬁnd the demand vector.

ture of metal products and machinery, and (4) wholesale and retail trade. The input-output table for these four sectors for

spreadsheet as a template for any 4 × 4 input-output table by just changing the entries of the input-output matrix and/or
D+. The rest of the computation will then be done automatically as the spreadsheet is updated. In other words, you can

CA S E  STU DY Airline Scheduling
Fly-by-Night Airlines ﬂies airplanes from ﬁve cities: Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, New York,
and Boston. Due to a strike, the airline has not had sufﬁcient crews to ﬂy its planes, so some
planes have been stranded in Chicago and Atlanta. On the other hand, Los Angeles, New
York, and Boston need more planes than they have. The airline knows how much it costs to
move a plane from one city to another. To get back on schedule at the lowest cost, how should
Fly-by-Night rearrange its planes?

Introduction
In this chapter we begin to look at one of the most important types of problems for busi-
ness and the sciences: ﬁnding the largest or smallest possible value of some quantity
(such as proﬁt or cost) under certain constraints (such as limited resources). We call such
problems optimization problems because we are trying to ﬁnd the best, or optimum,
value. The optimization problems we look at in this chapter involve linear functions only
and are known as linear programming (LP) problems. One of the main purposes of cal-
culus, which you may study later, is to solve nonlinear optimization problems.
Linear programming problems involving only two unknowns can usually be solved
by a graphical method which we discuss in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. When there are three
or more unknowns, we must use an algebraic method, as we had to do for systems of lin-
ear equations. The method we use is called the simplex method. Invented in 1947 by
George B. Dantzig1 (1914–2005), the simplex method is still the most commonly used
technique to solve LP problems in real applications, from ﬁnance to the computation of
trajectories for guided missiles.
The simplex method can be used for hand calculations when the numbers are fairly
small and the unknowns are few. Practical problems often involve large numbers and
many unknowns, however. Problems like routing telephone calls or airplane ﬂights, or
allocating resources in a manufacturing process can involve tens of thousands of un-
knowns. Solving such problems by hand is obviously impractical, and so computers are
regularly used. Although computer programs most often use the simplex method, math-
ematicians are always seeking faster methods. The ﬁrst radically different method of
solving LP problems was the ellipsoid algorithm published in 1979 by the Soviet math-
ematician Leonid G. Khachiyan2 (1952–2005). In 1984, Narendra Karmarkar (1957–),
a researcher at Bell Labs, created a more efﬁcient method now known as Karmarkar’s
algorithm. Although these methods (and others since developed) can be shown to be
faster than the simplex method in the worst cases, it seems to be true that the simplex
method is still the fastest in the applications that arise in practice.
Calculators and spreadsheets are very useful aids in the simplex method. In prac-
tice, software packages do most of the work, so you can think of what we teach you here
as a peek inside a “black box.” What the software cannot do for you is convert a real sit-
uation into a mathematical problem, so the most important lessons to get out of this
chapter are (1) how to recognize and set up a linear programming problem, and (2) how
to interpret the results.

1 Dantzig is the real-life source of the story of the student who, walking in late to a math class, copies down
two problems on the board, thinking they’re homework. After much hard work he hands in the solutions, only
to discover that he’s just solved two famous unsolved problems. This actually happened to Dantzig in gradu-
ate school in 1939. SOURCES: D. J. Albers and C. Reid, “An Interview of George B. Dantzig: The Father of
Linear Programming,” College Math. Journal, v. 17 (1986), pp. 293–314. Quoted and discussed in the context
of the urban legends it inspired at http://www.snopes.com/college/homework/unsolvable.asp.

aries together on May 23, 2005.
Graphing Linear Inequalities
By the end of the next section, we will be solving linear programming (LP) problems
with two unknowns. We use inequalities to describe the constraints in a problem, such as
limitations on resources. Recall the basic notation for inequalities.

There are also the inequalities < and >, called strict inequalities because they do not
permit equality. We do not use them in this chapter.
Following are some of the basic rules for manipulating inequalities. Although we il-
lustrate all of them with the inequality ≤, they apply equally well to inequalities with ≥
and to the strict inequalities < and >.

Rules for Manipulating Inequalities
1. The same quantity can be added to or subtracted 
x ≤y implies x −4 ≤y −4
from both sides of an inequality:
If x ≤y, then x + a ≤y + a for any real number a.
2. Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied
x ≤y implies 3x ≤3y
or divided by a positive constant:
If x ≤y and a is positive, then ax ≤ay.
3. Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied or 
x ≤y implies −3x ≥−3y
divided by a negative constant if the inequality 
is reversed:
If x ≤y and a is negative, then ax ≥ay.
4. The left and right sides of an inequality can be 
3x ≥5y implies 5y ≤3x
switched if the inequality is reversed:
If x ≤y, then y ≥x; if y ≥x, then x ≤y.
Here are the particular kinds of inequalities in which we’re interested:
Linear Inequalities and Solving Inequalities
An inequality in the unknown x is the statement that one expression involving x is less
than or equal to (or greater than or equal to) another. Similarly, we can have an
inequality in x and y, which involves expressions that contain x and y; an inequality in
x, y, and z; and so on. A linear inequality in one or more unknowns is an inequality of
the form
ax ≤b (or ax ≥b),
a and b real constants
ax + by ≤c (or ax + by ≥c),
a, b, and c real constants
ax + by + cz ≤d,
a, b, c, and d real constants
ax + by + cz + dw ≤e,
a, b, c, d, and e real constants
and so on.

Solving Linear Inequalities in Two Variables
Our ﬁrst goal is to solve linear inequalities in two variables—that is, inequalities of the
form ax + by ≤c. As an example, let’s solve
2x + 3y ≤6
We already know how to solve the equation 2x + 3y = 6. As we saw in Chapter 1, the
solution of this equation may be pictured as the set of all points (x, y) on the straight-line
graph of the equation. This straight line has x-intercept 3 (obtained by putting y = 0 in
the equation) and y-intercept 2 (obtained by putting x = 0 in the equation) and is shown
in Figure 1.
Notice that, if (x, y) is any point on the line, then x and y not only satisfy the equa-
tion 2x + 3y = 6, but they also satisfy the inequality 2x + 3y ≤6, because being equal
to 6 qualiﬁes as being less than or equal to 6. 
Q: Do the points on the line give all possible solutions to the inequality?
A: No. For example, try the origin, (0, 0). Since 2(0) + 3(0) = 0 ≤6, the point (0, 0) is a
solution that does not lie on the line. In fact, here is a possibly surprising fact: The solution to
any linear inequality in two unknowns is represented by an entire half plane: the set of all
points on one side of the line (including the line itself). Thus, because (0, 0) is a solution of
2x + 3y ≤6 and is not on the line, every point on the same side of the line as (0, 0) is a solution
as well (the blue region below the line in Figure 2 shows which half plane constitutes the
solution set). ■
To see why the solution set of 2x + 3y ≤6 is the entire half plane shown, start with
any point P on the line 2x + 3y = 6. We already know that P is a solution of
2x + 3y ≤6. If we choose any point Q directly below P, the x-coordinate of Q will be
the same as that of P, and the y-coordinate will be smaller. So the value of 2x + 3y at Q
will be smaller than the value at P, which is 6. Thus, 2x + 3y < 6 at Q, and so Q is an-
other solution of the inequality. (See Figure 3.) In other words, every point beneath the
line is a solution of 2x + 3y ≤6.
On the other hand, any point above the line is directly above a point on the line, and
so 2x + 3y > 6 for such a point. Thus, no point above the line is a solution of
2x + 3y ≤6.
The same kind of argument can be used to show that the solution set of every in-
equality of the form ax + by ≤c or ax + by ≥c consists of the half plane above or
below the line ax + by = c. The “test-point” procedure we describe below gives us an

Linear inequality in x, y, and z
A solution of an inequality in the unknown x is a value for x that makes the inequality true.
For example, 2x + 8 ≥89 has a solution x = 50 because 2(50) + 8 ≥89. Of course, it
has many other solutions as well. Similarly, a solution of an inequality in x and y is a pair of
values (x, y) making the inequality true. For example, (5, 1) is a solution of 3x −2y ≥8
because 3(5) −2(1) ≥8. To solve an inequality is to ﬁnd the set of all solutions.

easy method for deciding whether the solution set includes the region above or below
the corresponding line.
Now we are going to do something that will appear backward at ﬁrst (but makes it
simpler to sketch sets of solutions of systems of linear inequalities). For our standard
drawing of the region of solutions of 2x + 3y ≤6, we are going to shade only the part
that we do not want and leave the solution region blank. Think of covering over or
“blocking out” the unwanted points, leaving those that we do want in full view (but re-
member that the points on the boundary line are also points that we want). The result is
Figure 4. The reason we do this should become clear in Example 2.

Sketching the Region Represented by a Linear Inequality in Two Variables
1. Sketch the straight line obtained by replacing the given inequality with an equality.
2. Choose a test point not on the line; (0, 0) is a good choice if the line does not pass
through the origin. 
3. If the test point satisﬁes the inequality, then the set of solutions is the entire region on
the same side of the line as the test point. Otherwise, it is the region on the other side
of the line. In either case, shade (block out) the side that does not contain the solu-
tions, leaving the solution set unshaded.

using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter to see
how to graph inequalities using a
TI-83/84 or Excel.
Example 1 Graphing Single Inequalities
Sketch the regions determined by each of the following inequalities:
a. 3x −2y ≤6
b. 6x ≤12 + 4y
c. x ≤−1
d. y ≥0
e. x ≥3y
Solution
a. The boundary line 3x −2y = 6 has x-intercept 2 and y-intercept −3 (Figure 5). We
use (0, 0) as a test point (because it is not on the line). Because 3(0) −2(0) ≤6, the
inequality is satisﬁed by the test point (0, 0), and so it lies inside the solution set. The
solution set is shown in Figure 5.
b. The given inequality, 6x ≤12 + 4y, can be rewritten in the form ax + by ≤c by
subtracting 4y from both sides:
6x −4y ≤12
x
y
3x  2y  6
(0, 0)
Solution set
Figure 5

Dividing both sides by 2 gives the inequality 3x −2y ≤6, which we considered in
part (a). Now, applying the rules for manipulating inequalities does not affect the set
of solutions. Thus, the inequality 6x ≤12 + 4y has the same set of solutions as
3x −2y ≤6 (see Figure 5).
c. The region x ≤−1 has as boundary the vertical line x = −1. The test point (0, 0) is
not in the solution set, as shown in Figure 6.
d. The region y ≥0 has as boundary the horizontal line y = 0 (that is, the x-axis). We
cannot use (0, 0) for the test point because it lies on the boundary line. Instead, we
choose a convenient point not on the line y = 0—say, (0, 1). Because 1 ≥0, this
point is in the solution set, giving us the region shown in Figure 7.
e. The line x ≥3y has as boundary the line x = 3y or, solving for y,
y = 1
3x
This line passes through the origin with slope 1/3, so again we cannot choose the ori-
gin as a test point. Instead, we choose (0, 1). Substituting these coordinates in x ≥3y
gives 0 ≥3(1), which is false, so (0, 1) is not in the solution set, as shown in Figure 8.

Example 2 Graphing Simultaneous Inequalities
Sketch the region of points that satisfy both inequalities:
2x −5y ≤10
x + 2y ≤8
Solution Each inequality has a solution set that is a half plane. If a point is to satisfy
both inequalities, it must lie in both sets of solutions. Put another way, if we cover the
points that are not solutions to 2x −5y ≤10 and then also cover the points that are not
solutions to x + 2y ≤8, the points that remain uncovered must be the points we want,
those that are solutions to both inequalities. The result is shown in Figure 9, where the
unshaded region is the set of solutions.*
As a check, we can look at points in various regions in Figure 9. For example, our
graph shows that (0, 0) should satisfy both inequalities, and it does;
2(0) −5(0) = 0 ≤10
0 + 2(0) = 0 ≤8
On the other hand, (0, 5) should fail to satisfy one of the inequalities.
2(0) −5(5) = −25 ≤10
0 + 2(5) = 10 > 8
One more: (5, −1) should fail one of the inequalities:
2(5) −5(−1) = 15 > 10
5 + 2(−1) = 3 ≤8
* Technology Note Although these graphs are quite easy to do by hand, the more lines we have to graph the
more difﬁcult it becomes to get everything in the right place, and this is where graphing technology can be-
come important. This is especially true when, for instance, three or more lines intersect in points that are very
close together and hard to distinguish in hand-drawn graphs.

Here, we have solved each system of equations in the middle column to get the point on
the right, using the techniques of Chapter 2. You should do this for practice.*
As a partial check that we have drawn the correct region, let us choose any point in
its interior—say, (0, 0). We can easily check that (0, 0) satisﬁes all three given inequali-
ties. It follows that all of the points in the triangular region containing (0, 0) are also
solutions.
* Technology Note Using the trace feature makes it easy to locate corner points graphically. Remember to
zoom in for additional accuracy when appropriate. Of course, you can also use technology to help solve the
systems of equations, as we discussed in Chapter 2.
Example 3 Corner Points
Sketch the region of solutions of the following system of inequalities and list the coor-
dinates of all the corner points.
3x −2y ≤6
x + y ≥−5
y ≤4
Solution Shading the regions that we do not want leaves us with the triangle shown in
Figure 10. We label the corner points A, B, and C as shown.
Each of these corner points lies at the intersection of two of the bounding lines. So,
to ﬁnd the coordinates of each corner point, we need to solve the system of equations
given by the two lines. To do this systematically, we make the following table:

Take another look at the regions of solutions in Examples 2 and 3 (Figure 11).

Notice that the solution set in Figure 11(a) extends inﬁnitely far to the left, whereas
the one in Figure 11(b) is completely enclosed by a boundary. Sets that are completely
enclosed are called bounded, and sets that extend inﬁnitely in one or more directions
are unbounded. For example, all the solution sets in Example 1 are unbounded.

Example 4 Resource Allocation
Socaccio Pistachio Inc. makes two types of pistachio nuts: Dazzling Red and Organic.
Pistachio nuts require food color and salt, and the following table shows the amount of
food color and salt required for a 1-kilogram batch of pistachios, as well as the total
amount of these ingredients available each day.
Use a graph to show the possible numbers of batches of each type of pistachio So-
caccio can produce each day. This region (the solution set of a system of inequalities) is
called the feasible region.
Solution As we did in Chapter 2, we start by identifying the unknowns: Let x be the
number of batches of Dazzling Red manufactured per day and let y be the number of
batches of Organic manufactured each day.
Now, because of our experience with systems of linear equations, we are tempted to
say: for food color 2x + y = 20 and for salt, 10x + 20y = 220. However, no one is say-
ing that Socaccio has to use all available ingredients; the company might choose to use
fewer than the total available amounts if this proves more proﬁtable. Thus, 2x + y can
be anything up to a total of 20. In other words,
2x + y ≤20
Similarly,
10x + 20y ≤220
There are two more restrictions not explicitly mentioned: Neither x nor y can be nega-
tive (the company cannot produce a negative number of batches of nuts). Therefore, we
have the additional restrictions
x ≥0
y ≥0
These two inequalities tell us that the feasible region (solution set) is restricted to the
ﬁrst quadrant, because in the other quadrants, either x or y or both x and y are negative.
So instead of shading out all other quadrants, we can simply restrict our drawing to the
ﬁrst quadrant.
The (bounded) feasible region shown in Figure 12 is a graphical representation of
the limitations the company faces.

+Before we go on... Every point in the feasible region in Example 4 represents a value
for x and a value for y that do not violate any of the company’s restrictions. For example,
the point (5, 6) lies well inside the region, so the company can produce 5 batches of Daz-
zling Red nuts and 6 batches of Organic without exceeding the limitations on ingredi-
ents [that is, 2(5) + 6 = 16 ≤20 and 10(5) + 20(6) = 170 ≤220]. The corner points
A, B, C, and D are signiﬁcant if the company wishes to realize the greatest proﬁt, as we
will see in Section 4.2. We can ﬁnd the corners as in the following table:

International Flavors and Fra-
grances is a leading creator and
manufacturer of fragrances and
flavors.  Our mission is to develop
new fragrance and flavor mole-
cules for a variety of everyday
products such as cosmetics, de-
tergents, food, and beverages.
Several different departments at
my company work together to create these flavors and fra-
grances, including expert perfumers and flavorists blending a
variety of unique molecules together to create different types
of tastes and scents. But as a toxicologist my goal is to per-
form a safety evaluation of each new molecule before it can
be sold to the public.  This safety evaluation includes testing
the product to determine a safe use level and using scientific
models to predict how the material will act on the human
body and the environment.
How does mathematics play a part in my daily tasks? As
an IFF toxicologist (a.k.a. Regulatory Compliance Specialist),
I incorporate mathematics into my job by using a chemical
program called “Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic Pro-
filer.”  PBT uses the structure of the chemical and mathemat-
ical equations to determine if that chemical structure may
pose a hazard to the environment.
For example, when a chemist in another department de-
velops a new fragrance chemical she sends it to me. I will
then input the structure of that chemical in to the PBT Profile
and it will calculate various physical and chemical properties
of the new chemical. PBT and I calculate how long a material
will persist in the environment, whether or not it is likely to
bioaccumulate in the body, and how toxic the material will be
to aquatic species. Based on these predictions, I determine
what type of further information is necessary in order to eval-
uate the safety of the new chemical and whether or not it
may be hazardous to people and the environment.
So, as you can see, mathematics helps toxicologists de-
termine the safe use level of everyday products in order to
protect the consumer and the environment from harm. You
may consider this when you read this chapter and take your
first bite of your dinner tonight!

Recognizing Whether to Use a Linear Inequality 
or a Linear Equation
Q: How do I know whether to model a situation by a linear inequality like y: 3x + 2y ≤10 or by
a linear equation like 3x + 2y = 10?
A: Here are some key phrases to look for: at most, up to, no more than, at least, or more, ex-
actly. Suppose, for instance, that nuts cost 3¢, bolts cost 2¢, x is the number of nuts you can
buy, and y is the number of bolts you can buy.
• If you have up to 10¢ to spend, then 3x + 2y ≤10.
• If you must spend exactly 10¢, then 3x + 2y = 10.
• If you plan to spend at least 10¢, then 3x + 2y ≥10.
The use of inequalities to model a situation is often more realistic than the use of equations; for
instance, one cannot always expect to exactly fill all orders, spend the exact amount of one’s
budget, or keep a plant operating at exactly 100% capacity. ■

Solving Linear Programming
Problems Graphically
As we saw in Example 4 in Section 4.1, in some scenarios the possibilities are restricted
by a system of linear inequalities. In that example, it would be natural to ask which of
the various possibilities gives the company the largest proﬁt. This is a kind of problem
known as a linear programming problem (commonly referred to as an LP problem).
quick Example
Linear Programming (LP) Problems
A linear programming problem in two unknowns x and y is one in which we are to ﬁnd
the maximum or minimum value of a linear expression
ax + by
called the objective function, subject to a number of linear constraints of the form
cx + dy ≤e
or
cx + dy ≥e
The largest or smallest value of the objective function is called the optimal value, and
a pair of values of x and y that gives the optimal value constitutes an optimal solution.
Maximize
p = x + y
Objective function
subject to
x + 2y ≤12
2x + y ≤12
x ≥0, y ≥0

Constraints
See Example 1 for a method of solving this LP problem (that is, ﬁnding an optimal so-
lution and value).
The set of points (x, y) satisfying all the constraints is the feasible region for the
problem. Our methods of solving LP problems rely on the following facts:
Fundamental Theorem of Linear Programming
• If an LP problem has optimal solutions, then at least one of these solutions occurs at
a corner point of the feasible region.
• Linear programming problems with bounded, nonempty feasible regions always have
optimal solutions.
Let’s see how we can use this to solve an LP problem, and then we’ll discuss why
it’s true.

Maximize
p = x + y

x + 2y ≤12

2x + y = 12
Solution We begin by drawing the feasible region for the problem. We do this using
the techniques of Section 4.1, and we get Figure 13.
Each feasible point (point in the feasible region) gives an x and a y satisfying the
constraints. The question now is, which of these points gives the largest value of the ob-
jective function p = x + y? The Fundamental Theorem of Linear Programming tells us
that the largest value must occur at one (or more) of the corners of the feasible region.
In the following table, we list the coordinates of each corner point and we compute the
value of the objective function at each corner.

Figure 13
Now we simply pick the one that gives the largest value for p, which is D. Therefore, the
optimal value of p is 8, and an optimal solution is (4, 4).
Now we owe you an explanation of why one of the corner points should be an
optimal solution. The question is, which point in the feasible region gives the largest
possible value of p = x + y?
Consider ﬁrst an easier question: Which points result in a particular value of p? For
example, which points result in p = 2? These would be the points on the line x + y = 2,
which is the line labeled p = 2 in Figure 14.
Now suppose we want to know which points make p = 4: These would be the
points on the line x + y = 4, which is the line labeled p = 4 in Figure 14. Notice that
this line is parallel to but higher than the line p = 2. (If p represented proﬁt in an appli-
cation, we would call these isoproﬁt lines, or constant-proﬁt lines.) Imagine moving
this line up or down in the picture. As we move the line down, we see smaller values of
p, and as we move it up, we see larger values. Several more of these lines are drawn in
Figure 14. Look, in particular, at the line labeled p = 10. This line does not meet the
feasible region, meaning that no feasible point makes p as large as 10. Starting with
the line p = 2, as we move the line up, increasing p, there will be a last line that meets
the feasible region. In the ﬁgure it is clear that this is the line p = 8, and this meets the
feasible region in only one point, which is the corner point D. Therefore D gives the
greatest value of p of all feasible points.
If we had been asked to maximize some other objective function, such as
p = x + 3y, then the optimal solution might be different. Figure 15 shows some of
the isoproﬁt lines for this objective function. This time, the last point that is hit as p
increases is C, not D. This tells us that the optimal solution is (0, 6), giving the optimal
value p = 18.
This discussion should convince you that the optimal value in an LP problem will
always occur at one of the corner points. By the way, it is possible for the optimal value
to occur at two corner points and at all points along an edge connecting them. (Do you
see why?) We will see this in Example 3(b).
Here is a summary of the method we have just been using.

Graphical Method for Solving Linear Programming Problems 
in Two Unknowns (Bounded Feasible Regions)
1. Graph the feasible region and check that it is bounded.
2. Compute the coordinates of the corner points.
3. Substitute the coordinates of the corner points into the objective function to see
which gives the maximum (or minimum) value of the objective function.
4. Any such corner point is an optimal solution.
Note If the feasible region is unbounded, this method will work only if there are opti-
mal solutions; otherwise, it will not work. We will show you a method for deciding this
on p. 275. ■
Applications
Example 2 Resource Allocation
Acme Babyfoods mixes two strengths of apple juice. One quart of Beginner’s juice is
made from 30 ﬂuid ounces of water and 2 ﬂuid ounces of apple juice concentrate. One
quart of Advanced juice is made from 20 ﬂuid ounces of water and 12 ﬂuid ounces of
concentrate. Every day Acme has available 30,000 ﬂuid ounces of water and 3600 ﬂuid
ounces of concentrate. Acme makes a proﬁt of 20¢ on each quart of Beginner’s juice and
30¢ on each quart of Advanced juice. How many quarts of each should Acme make each
day to get the largest proﬁt? How would this change if Acme made a proﬁt of 40¢ on
Beginner’s juice and 20¢ on Advanced juice?
Solution Looking at the question that we are asked, we see that our unknown quanti-
ties are
x = number of quarts of Beginner’s juice made each day
y = number of quarts of Advanced juice made each day
(In this context, x and y are often called the decision variables, because we must decide
what their values should be in order to get the largest proﬁt.) We can write down the data
given in the form of a table (the numbers in the ﬁrst two columns are amounts per quart
of juice):
Beginner’s, x
Advanced, y
Available
Water (ounces)
30
20
30,000
Concentrate (ounces)
2
12
3600
Proﬁt (¢)
20
30
Because nothing in the problem says that Acme must use up all the water or concentrate,
just that it can use no more than what is available, the ﬁrst two rows of the table give us
two inequalities:
30x + 20y ≤30,000
2x + 12y ≤3600

3x + 2y = 3000
(900, 150)
39,000
x + 6y = 1800
We are seeking to maximize the objective function p, so we look for corner points that
give the maximum value for p. Because the maximum occurs at the point D, we con-
clude that the (only) optimal solution occurs at D. Thus, the company should make 900
quarts of Beginner’s juice and 150 quarts of Advanced juice, for a largest possible proﬁt
of 22,500¢, or $225.
If, instead, the company made a proﬁt of 40¢ on each quart of Beginner’s juice and
20¢ on each quart of Advanced juice, then we would have p = 40x + 20y. This gives
the following table:

Dividing the ﬁrst inequality by 10 and the second by 2 gives
3x + 2y ≤3000
x + 6y ≤1800
We also have that x ≥0 and y ≥0 because Acme can’t make a negative amount of
juice. To ﬁnish setting up the problem, we are asked to maximize the proﬁt, which is
p = 20x + 30y
Expressed in ¢
This gives us our LP problem:
Maximize
p = 20x + 30y
subject to
3x + 2y ≤3000
x + 6y ≤1800
x ≥0, y ≥0
The (bounded) feasible region is shown in Figure 16.
The corners and the values of the objective function are listed in the following table:
We can see that, in this case, Acme should make 1000 quarts of Beginner’s juice and no
Advanced juice, for a largest possible proﬁt of 40,000¢, or $400.

+Before we go on… Notice that, in the ﬁrst version of the problem in Example 2, the
company used all the water and juice concentrate:
Water:
30(900) + 20(150) = 30,000
Concentrate:
2(900) + 12(150) = 3600
In the second version, it used all the water but not all the concentrate:
Water:
30(100) + 20(0) = 30,000
Concentrate:
2(100) + 12(0) = 200 < 3600 ■
Example 3 Investments
The Solid Trust Savings & Loan Company has set aside $25 million for loans to home
buyers. Its policy is to allocate at least $10 million annually for luxury condominiums.
A government housing development grant it receives requires, however, that at least
one-third of its total loans be allocated to low-income housing.
a. Solid Trust’s return on condominiums is 12% and its return on low-income housing is
10%. How much should the company allocate for each type of housing to maximize
its total return?
b. Redo part (a), assuming that the return is 12% on both condominiums and low-
income housing.
Solution
a. We ﬁrst identify the unknowns: Let x be the annual amount (in millions of dollars)
allocated to luxury condominiums and let y be the annual amount allocated to low-
income housing.
We now look at the constraints. The ﬁrst constraint is mentioned in the ﬁrst sen-
tence: The total the company can invest is $25 million. Thus,
x + y ≤25
(The company is not required to invest all of the $25 million; rather, it can invest up
to $25 million.) Next, the company has allocated at least $10 million to condos.
Rephrasing this in terms of the unknowns, we get
The amount allocated to condos is at least $10 million.
The phrase “is at least” means ≥. Thus, we obtain a second constraint:
x ≥10
The third constraint is that at least one-third of the total ﬁnancing must be for low-
income housing. Rephrasing this, we say:
The amount allocated to low-income housing is at least one-third of the total.
Because the total investment will be x + y, we get
y ≥1
3(x + y)
We put this in the standard form of a linear inequality as follows:
3y ≥x + y
−x + 2y ≥0
Multiply both sides by 3.
Subtract x + y from both sides.

Now, what about the return on these investments? According to the data, the an-
nual return is given by
p = 0.12x + 0.10y

From the table, we see that the values of x and y that maximize the return are
x = 50/3 and y = 25/3, which give a total return of $2.833 million. In other words,
the most proﬁtable course of action is to invest $16.667 million in loans for condo-
miniums and $8.333 million in loans for low-income housing, giving a maximum an-
nual return of $2.833 million.

the annual return. In fact, any point along the line segment AB will yield an annual
return of $3 million. For example, the point (12, 13) lies on the line segment AB and
also yields an annual revenue of $3 million. This happens because the “isoreturn”
lines are parallel to that edge.

The preceding examples all had bounded feasible regions. If the feasible region is
unbounded, then, provided there are optimal solutions, the fundamental theorem of lin-
ear programming guarantees that the above method will work. The following procedure
determines whether or not optimal solutions exist and ﬁnds them when they do.

Solving Linear Programming Problems in Two Unknowns 
(Unbounded Feasible Regions)
If the feasible region of an LP problem is unbounded, proceed as follows:
1. Draw a rectangle large enough so that all the corner points are inside the rectangle
(and not on its boundary):
Corner points: A, B, C
Corner points inside the rectangle
2. Shade the outside of the rectangle so as to deﬁne a new bounded feasible region,
and locate the new corner points:
New corner points: D, E, and F
3. Obtain the optimal solutions using this bounded feasible region.
4. If any optimal solutions occur at one of the original corner points (A, B, and C in the
ﬁgure), then the LP problem has that corner point as an optimal solution. Other-
wise, the LP problem has no optimal solutions. When the latter occurs, we say that
the objective function is unbounded, because it can assume arbitrarily large (posi-
tive or negative) values.

In the next two examples, we work with unbounded feasible regions.
Example 4 Cost
You are the manager of a small store that specializes in hats, sunglasses, and other ac-
cessories. You are considering a sales promotion of a new line of hats and sunglasses.
You will offer the sunglasses only to those who purchase two or more hats, so you will
sell at least twice as many hats as pairs of sunglasses. Moreover, your supplier tells you
that, due to seasonal demand, your order of sunglasses cannot exceed 100 pairs. To en-
sure that the sale items ﬁll out the large display you have set aside, you estimate that you
should order at least 210 items in all.
a. Assume that you will lose $3 on every hat and $2 on every pair of sunglasses sold.
Given the constraints above, how many hats and pairs of sunglasses should you order
to lose the least amount of money in the sales promotion?
b. Suppose instead that you lose $1 on every hat sold but make a proﬁt of $5 on every
pair of sunglasses sold. How many hats and pairs of sunglasses should you order to
make the largest proﬁt in the sales promotion?
c. Now suppose that you make a proﬁt of $1 on every hat sold but lose $5 on every pair
of sunglasses sold. How many hats and pairs of sunglasses should you order to make
the largest proﬁt in the sales promotion?
Solution
a. The unknowns are:
x = number of hats you order
y = number of pairs of sunglasses you order
The objective is to minimize the total loss:
c = 3x + 2y
Now for the constraints. The requirement that you will sell at least twice as many
hats as sunglasses can be rephrased as:
The number of hats is at least twice the number of pairs of sunglasses
or
x ≥2y
which, in standard form, is
x −2y ≥0
Next, your order of sunglasses cannot exceed 100 pairs, so
y ≤100
Finally, you would like to sell at least 210 items in all, giving
x + y ≥210
Thus, the LP problem is the following:
Minimize
c = 3x + 2y
subject to
x −2y ≥0
y ≤100
x +
y ≥210
x ≥0, y ≥0

The corner point that gives the minimum value of the objective function c is B. Be-
cause B is one of the corner points of the original feasible region, we conclude that
our linear programming problem has an optimal solution at B. Thus, the combination
that gives the smallest loss is 140 hats and 70 pairs of sunglasses.
b. The LP problem is the following:
Maximize p = −x + 5y
subject to
x −2y ≥0
y ≤100
x +
y ≥210
x ≥0, y ≥0
Because most of the work is already done for us in part (a), all we need to do is change
the objective function in the table that lists the corner points:
The feasible region is shown in Figure 18.
This region is unbounded, so there is no guarantee that there are any optimal so-
lutions. Following the procedure described above, we enclose the corner points in a
rectangle as shown in Figure 19. (There are many inﬁnitely many possible rectangles
we could have used. We chose one that gives convenient coordinates for the new
corners.)
We now list all the corners of this bounded region along with the corresponding
values of the objective function c:
The corner point that gives the maximum value of the objective function p is C. Be-
cause C is one of the corner points of the original feasible region, we conclude that
our LP problem has an optimal solution at C. Thus, the combination that gives the
largest proﬁt ($300) is 200 hats and 100 pairs of sunglasses.

* Whether or not these musicians are capable of singing decent soprano notes will be left to chance. You rea-
son that a few bad notes will add character to the ballade.
c. The objective function is now p = x −5y, which is the negative of the objective
function used in part (b). Thus, the table of values of p is the same as in part (b), ex-
cept that it has opposite signs in the p column. This time we ﬁnd that the maximum
value of p occurs at E. However, E is not a corner point of the original feasible region,
so the LP problem has no optimal solution. Referring to Figure 18, we can make the
objective p as large as we like by choosing a point far to the right in the unbounded
feasible region. Thus, the objective function is unbounded; that is, it is possible to
make an arbitrarily large proﬁt.
Example 5 Resource Allocation
You are composing a very avant-garde ballade for violins and bassoons. In your ballade,
each violinist plays a total of two notes and each bassoonist only one note. To make your
ballade long enough, you decide that it should contain at least 200 instrumental notes.
Furthermore, after playing the requisite two notes, each violinist will sing one soprano
note, while each bassoonist will sing three soprano notes.* To make the ballade sufﬁ-
ciently interesting, you have decided on a minimum of 300 soprano notes. To give your
composition a sense of balance, you wish to have no more than three times as many bas-
soonists as violinists. Violinists charge $200 per performance and bassoonists $400 per
performance. How many of each should your ballade call for in order to minimize per-
sonnel costs?
Solution First, the unknowns are x = number of violinists and y = number of bas-
soonists. The constraint on the number of instrumental notes implies that
2x + y ≥200
because the total number is to be at least 200. Similarly, the constraint on the number of
soprano notes is
x + 3y ≥300
The next one is a little tricky. As usual, we reword it in terms of the quantities x and y.
The number of bassoonists should be no more than three times the number of violinists.
Thus,
y ≤3x
or
3x −y ≥0
Finally, the total cost per performance will be
c = 200x + 400y
We wish to minimize total cost. So, our linear programming problem is as follows:
Minimize
c = 200x + 400y
subject to
2x +
y ≥200
x + 3y ≥300

x ≥0, y ≥0

* Here is an example where graphing technology would help in determining the corner points. Unless you are
very conﬁdent in the accuracy of your sketch, how do you know that the line y = 3x falls to the left of the
point B, for example? If it were to fall to the right, then B would not be a corner point and the solution would
be different. You could (and should) check that B satisﬁes the inequality 3x −y ≥0, so that the line falls to
the left of B as shown. However, if you use a graphing calculator or computer, you can be fairly conﬁdent of
the picture produced without doing further calculations.

FAQs
Recognizing a Linear Programming Problem, Setting Up
Inequalities, and Dealing with Unbounded Regions
Q: How do I recognize when an application leads to an LP problem as opposed to a system of
linear equations?
A: Here are some cues that suggest an LP problem:
• Key phrases suggesting inequalities rather than equalities, like at most, up to, no more than, at
least, and or more.
• A quantity that is being maximized or minimized (this will be the objective). Key phrases are
maximum, minimum, most, least, largest, greatest, smallest, as large as possible, and as small
as possible. ■
Q: How do I deal with tricky phrases like “there should be no more than twice as many nuts as
bolts” or “at least 50% of the total should be bolts”?
A: The easiest way to deal with phrases like this is to use the technique we discussed in
Chapter 2: reword the phrases using “the number of . . . ”, as in
The number of nuts (x) is no more than twice the number of bolts (y)
x ≤2y
The number of bolts is at least 50% of the total                            y ≥0.50(x + y) ■
From the table we see that the minimum cost occurs at B, a corner point of the original
feasible region. The linear programming problem thus has an optimal solution, and the
minimum cost is $44,000 per performance, employing 60 violinists and 80 bassoonists.
(Quite a wasteful ballade, one might say.)

Q: Do I always have to add a rectangle to deal with unbounded regions?
A: Under some circumstances, you can tell right away whether optimal solutions exist, even
when the feasible region is unbounded.
Note that the following apply only when we have the constraints x ≥0 and y ≥0.
1. If you are minimizing c = ax + by with a and b nonnegative, then optimal solutions always
exist. (Examples 4(a) and 5 are of this type.)
2. If you are maximizing p = ax + by with a and b nonnegative (and not both zero), then there
is no optimal solution unless the feasible region is bounded.
Do you see why statements (1) and (2) are true? ■

39. Planning My friends: I, the mighty Brutus, have decided to
prepare for retirement by instructing young warriors in the
arts of battle and diplomacy. For each hour spent in battle
instruction, I have decided to charge 50 ducats. For each hour
in diplomacy instruction I shall charge 40 ducats. Due to my
advancing years, I can spend no more than 50 hours per week
instructing the youths, although the great Jove knows that
they are sorely in need of instruction! Due to my fondness for
physical pursuits, I have decided to spend no more than one-
third of the total time in diplomatic instruction. However, the
present border crisis with the Gauls is a sore indication of our
poor abilities as diplomats. As a result, I have decided to
spend at least 10 hours per week instructing in diplomacy.
Finally, to complicate things further, there is the matter of
Scarlet Brew: I have estimated that each hour of battle
instruction will require 10 gallons of Scarlet Brew to quench
my students’ thirst, and that each hour of diplomacy instruc-
tion, being less physically demanding, requires half that
amount. Because my harvest of red berries has far exceeded
my expectations, I estimate that I’ll have to use at least 400
gallons per week in order to avoid storing the ﬁne brew at
great expense. Given all these restrictions, how many hours
per week should I spend in each type of instruction to maxi-
mize my income?
40. Planning Repeat the preceding exercise with the following
changes: I would like to spend no more than half the total time
in diplomatic instruction, and I must use at least 600 gallons
of Scarlet Brew.

began, “I have a quandary: As you well know, I possess great
expertise in sleep spells and shock spells, but unfortunately,
these are proving to be a drain on my aural energy resources;
each sleep spell costs me 500 pico-shirleys of aural energy,
while each shock spell requires 750 pico-shirleys. Clearly, I
would like to hold my overall expenditure of aural energy to a
minimum, and still meet my commitments in protecting the
Sisterhood from the ever-present threat of trolls. Speciﬁcally,
I have estimated that each sleep spell keeps us safe for an av-
erage of two minutes, while every shock spell protects us for
about three minutes. We certainly require enough protection
to last 24 hours of each day, and possibly more, just to be safe.
At the same time, I have noticed that each of my sleep spells
can immobilize three trolls at once, while one of my typical
shock spells (having a narrower range) can immobilize only
two trolls at once. We are faced, my sisters, with an onslaught
of 1200 trolls per day! Finally, as you are no doubt aware, the

being blackmailed by numerous individuals and is having a
very difﬁcult time keeping his blackmailers from going pub-
lic. He has been keeping them at bay with two kinds of payoff:
gold bars from the Royal Treasury and political favors.
Through bitter experience, he has learned that each payoff in
gold gives him peace for an average of about 1 month, while
each political favor seems to earn him about a month and a
half of reprieve. To maintain his ﬂawless reputation in the
Court, he feels he cannot afford any revelations about his
tainted past to come to light within the next year. Thus it is im-
perative that his blackmailers be kept at bay for 12 months.
Furthermore, he would like to keep the number of gold pay-
offs at no more than one-quarter of the combined number of
payoffs because the outward ﬂow of gold bars might arouse
suspicion on the part of the Royal Treasurer. The Grand Vizier
feels that he can do no more than seven political favors per
year without arousing undue suspicion in the Court. The gold
payoffs tend to deplete his travel budget. (The treasury has
been subsidizing his numerous trips to the Himalayas.) He es-
timates that each gold bar removed from the treasury will cost
him four trips. On the other hand because the administering of
political favors tends to cost him valuable travel time, he sus-
pects that each political favor will cost him about two trips.
Now, he would obviously like to keep his blackmailers si-
lenced and lose as few trips as possible. What is he to do?
How many trips will he lose in the next year?

velop a model to allocate service technicians’ time between
new customers (those still covered by service contracts) and
old customers (whose service contracts have expired). To en-
sure that new customers are satisﬁed with your company’s
service, the sales department has instituted a policy that at
least 100 hours per week be allocated to servicing new cus-
tomers. At the same time, your superiors have informed you
that the company expects your department to generate at least
$1200 per week in revenues. Technical service time for new
customers generates an average of $10 per hour (because
much of the service is still under warranty) and for old cus-
tomers generates $30 per hour. How many hours per week

different fabrics on eight dobby looms which operate 24
hours per day and are scheduled for 30 days in the coming
month. The Scottsville Textile Mill will produce only Fabric 1
and Fabric 2 during the coming month. Each dobby loom can
turn out 4.63 yards of either fabric per hour. Assume that there
is a monthly demand of 16,000 yards of Fabric 1 and 12,000
yards of Fabric 2. Proﬁts are calculated as 33¢ per yard for
each fabric produced on the dobby looms.
a. Will it be possible to satisfy total demand?
b. In the event that total demand is not satisﬁed, the
Scottsville Textile Mill will need to purchase the fabrics
from another mill to make up the shortfall. Its proﬁts on
resold fabrics ordered from another mill amount to 20¢
per yard for Fabric 1 and 16¢ per yard for Fabric 2. How
many yards of each fabric should it produce to maximize
proﬁts?

The Simplex Method: Solving Standard
Maximization Problems
The method discussed in Section 4.2 works quite well for LP problems in two unknowns,
but what about three or more unknowns? Because we need an axis for each unknown,
wewouldneedtodrawgraphsinthreedimensions(wherewehave x-,y-andz-coordinates)
to deal with problems in three unknowns, and we would have to draw in hyperspace to
answer questions involving four or more unknowns. Given the state of technology as
this book is being written, we can’t easily do this. So we need another method for solving
LP problems that will work for any number of unknowns. One such method, called the
simplex method, has been the method of choice since it was invented by George Dantzig
in 1947. To illustrate it best, we ﬁrst use it to solve only so-called standard maximization
problems.
Standard Maximization Problem
A standard maximization problem in n unknowns is an LP problem in which we are
required to maximize (not minimize) an objective function of the form*
p = ax + by + cz + · · · (n terms)
where a, b, c, . . . are numbers, subject to the constraints
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0, . . .
* As in the chapter on linear equations we will seldom use the traditional subscripted variables x1, x2, . . . .
These are very useful names when you start running out of letters of the alphabet, but we should not ﬁnd our-
selves in that predicament.

286
Chapter 4
Linear Programming
The idea behind the simplex method is this: In any linear programming problem,
there is a feasible region. If there are only two unknowns, we can draw the region; if
there are three unknowns, it is a solid region in space; and if there are four or more un-
knowns, it is an abstract higher-dimensional region. But it is a faceted region with cor-
ners (think of a diamond), and it is at one of these corners that we will ﬁnd the optimal
solution. Geometrically, what the simplex method does is to start at the corner where all
the unknowns are 0 (possible because we are talking of standard maximization prob-
lems) and then walk around the region, from corner to adjacent corner, always increas-
ing the value of the objective function, until the best corner is found. In practice, we will
visit only a small number of the corners before ﬁnding the right one. Algebraically, as
we are about to see, this walking around is accomplished by matrix manipulations of the
same sort as those used in the chapter on systems of linear equations.
We describe the method while working through an example.
quick Examples
and further constraints of the form
Ax + By + Cz + · · · ≤N
where A, B, C, . . . , N are numbers with N nonnegative. Note that the inequality here
must be ≤, not = or ≥.

2. Maximize
p = 2x −3y + 3z
subject to
2x
+ z ≥7
−x + 3y −6z ≤6
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0
The inequality 2x + z ≥7 cannot be written in the required form. If we reverse the in-
equality by multiplying both sides by –1, we get −2x −z ≤−7, but a negative value on
the right side is not allowed.
This is a standard maximization problem.
This is not a standard maximization problem.
Example 1 Introducing the Simplex Method
Maximize
p = 3x + 2y + z
subject to
2x + 2y + z ≤10
x + 2y + 3z ≤15
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0
Solution
Step 1 Convert to a system of linear equations. The inequalities 2x + 2y + z ≤10 and
x + 2y + 3z ≤15 are less convenient than equations. Look at the ﬁrst inequality. It says
that the left-hand side, 2x + 2y + z, must have some positive number (or zero) added to
it if it is to equal 10. Because we don’t yet know what x, y, and z are, we are not yet sure

4.3 The Simplex Method: Solving Standard Maximization Problems
287
what number to add to the left-hand side. So we invent a new unknown, s ≥0, called a
slack variable, to “take up the slack,” so that 
2x + 2y + z + s = 10
Turning to the next inequality, x + 2y + 3z ≤15, we now add a slack variable to its left-
hand side, to get it up to the value of the right-hand side. We might have to add a differ-
ent number than we did the last time, so we use a new slack variable, t ≥0, and obtain
x + 2y + 3z + t = 15
Use a different slack variable for each constraint.
Now we write the system of equations we have (including the one that deﬁnes the ob-
jective function) in standard form.
2x + 2y + z + s
= 10
x + 2y + 3z
+ t
= 15
−3x −2y −z
+ p = 0
Note three things: First, all the variables are neatly aligned in columns, as they were in
Chapter 2. Second, in rewriting the objective function p = 3x + 2y + z, we have left
the coefﬁcient of p as +1 and brought the other variables over to the same side of the
equation as p. This will be our standard procedure from now on. Don’t write
3x + 2y + z −p = 0 (even though it means the same thing) because the negative coef-
ﬁcients will be important in later steps. Third, the above system of equations has fewer
equations than unknowns, and hence cannot have a unique solution.
Step 2 Set up the initial tableau. We represent our system of equations by the following
table (which is simply the augmented matrix in disguise), called the initial tableau:
x
y
z
s

The labels along the top keep track of which columns belong to which variables. 
Now notice a peculiar thing. If we rewrite the matrix using the variables s, t, and p
ﬁrst, we get the following matrix

Matrix with s, t, and p columns ﬁrst
which is already in reduced form. We can therefore read off the general solution (see
Section 2.2) to our system of equations as
s = 10 −2x −2y −z
t = 15 −x −2y −3z
p = 0 + 3x + 2y + z
x, y, z arbitrary
Thus, we get a whole family of solutions, one for each choice of x, y, and z. One possi-
ble choice is to set x, y, and z all equal to 0. This gives the particular solution
s = 10, t = 15, p = 0, x = 0, y = 0, z = 0
Set x = y = z = 0 above.

Selecting the Pivot Column
Choose the negative number with the largest magnitude on the left-hand side of the bot-
tom row (that is, don’t consider the last number in the bottom row). Its column is the pivot
column. (If there are two candidates, choose either one.) If all the numbers on the left-hand
side of the bottom row are zero or positive, then we are done, and the basic solution is the
optimal solution.

This solution is called the basic solution associated with the tableau. The variables
s and t are called the active variables, and x, y, and z are the inactive variables. (Other
terms used are basic and nonbasic variables.) 
We can obtain the basic solution directly from the tableau as follows. 
• The active variables correspond to the cleared columns (columns with only one
nonzero entry). 
• The values of the active variables are calculated as shown below.
• All other variables are inactive, and set equal to zero.
As an additional aid to recognizing which variables are active and which are inactive, we
label each row with the name of the corresponding active variable. Thus, the complete
initial tableau looks like this.
* Also see Section 2.2 for a discussion of pivots and pivoting.
This basic solution represents our starting position x = y = z = 0 in the feasible
region in xyz space.
We now need to move to another corner point. To do so, we choose a pivot* in one
of the ﬁrst three columns of the tableau and clear its column. Then we will get a differ-
ent basic solution, which corresponds to another corner point. Thus, in order to move
from corner point to corner point, all we have to do is choose suitable pivots and clear
columns in the usual manner.
The next two steps give the procedure for choosing the pivot.
Step 3 Select the pivot column (the column that contains the pivot we are seeking).
s

p

4.3 The Simplex Method: Solving Standard Maximization Problems

Simple enough. The most negative number in the bottom row is –3, so we choose the x
column as the pivot column:
Q: Why choose the pivot column this way?
A: The variable labeling the pivot column is going to be increased from 0 to something positive.
In the equation p = 3x + 2y + z, the fastest way to increase p is to increase x because p would
increase by 3 units for every 1-unit increase in x. (If we chose to increase y, then p would
increase by only 2 units for every 1-unit increase in y, and if we increased z instead, p would
grow even more slowly.) In short, choosing the pivot column this way makes it likely that we’ll
increase p as much as possible. ■
Step 4 Select the pivot in the pivot column.
Selecting the Pivot
1. The pivot must always be a positive number. (This rules out zeros and negative num-
bers, such as the –3 in the bottom row.)
2. For each positive entry b in the pivot column, compute the ratio a/b, where a is the
number in the rightmost column in that row. We call this a test ratio.
3. Of these ratios, choose the smallest one. The corresponding number b is the pivot.
In our example, the test ratio in the ﬁrst row is 10/2 = 5, and the test ratio in the second
row is 15/1 = 15. Here, 5 is the smallest, so the 2 in the upper left is our pivot.

Q: Why select the pivot this way?
A: The rule given above guarantees that, after pivoting, all variables will be nonnegative in the
basic solution. In other words, it guarantees that we will remain in the feasible region. We will
explain further after finishing this example. ■
Step 5 Use the pivot to clear the column in the normal manner and then relabel the
pivot row with the label from the pivot column. It is important to follow the exact
prescription described in Section 2.2 for formulating the row operations:

All entries in the last column should remain nonnegative after pivoting. Furthermore,
because the x column (and no longer the s column) will be cleared, x will become an ac-
tive variable. In other words, the s on the left of the pivot will be replaced by x. We call
s the departing, or exiting variable and x the entering variable for this step. 
This gives
This is the second tableau.
Step 6 Go to Step 3 But wait! According to Step 3, we are ﬁnished because there are no
negative numbers in the bottom row. Thus, we can read off the answer. Remember,
though, that the solution for x, the ﬁrst active variable, is not just x = 10, but is
x = 10/2 = 5 because the pivot has not been reduced to a 1. Similarly, t = 20/2 = 10
and p = 30/2 = 15. All the other variables are zero because they are inactive. Thus, the
solution is as follows: p has a maximum value of 15, and this occurs when x = 5, y = 0
and z = 0. (The slack variables then have the values s = 0 and t = 10.)
Q: Why can we stop when there are no negative numbers in the bottom row? Why does this
tableau give an optimal solution?
A: The bottom row corresponds to the equation 2y + z + 3s + 2p = 30, or 
p = 15 −y −1
2 z −3
2 s
Think of this as part of the general solution to our original system of equations, with y, z, and s
as the parameters. Because these variables must be nonnegative, the largest possible value of p
in any feasible solution of the system comes when all three of the parameters are 0. Thus, the
current basic solution must be an optimal solution.* ■
* Calculators or spreadsheets could obviously be a big help in the calculations here, just as in Chapter 2. We’ll
say more about that after the next couple of examples.
We owe some further explanation for Step 4 of the simplex method. After Step 3,
we knew that x would be the entering variable, and we needed to choose the departing
variable. In the next basic solution, x was to have some positive value and we wanted this

4.3 The Simplex Method: Solving Standard Maximization Problems
291
value to be as large as possible (to make p as large as possible) without making any other
variables negative. Look again at the equations written in Step 2:
s = 10 −2x −2y −z
t = 15 −x −2y −3z
We needed to make either s or t into an inactive variable and hence zero. Also, y and z
were to remain inactive. If we had made s inactive, then we would have had 0 = 10 −2x,
so x = 10/2 = 5. This would have made t = 15 −5 = 10, which would be ﬁne. On the
other hand, if we had made t inactive, then we would have had 0 = 15 −x, so x = 15,
and this would have made s = 10 −2 · 15 = −20, which would not be ﬁne, because
slack variables must be nonnegative. In other words, we had a choice of making
x = 10/2 = 5 or x = 15/1 = 15, but making x larger than 5 would have made another
variable negative. We were thus compelled to choose the smaller ratio, 5, and make s the
departing variable. Of course, we do not have to think it through this way every time. We
just use the rule stated in Step 4. (For a graphical explanation, see Example 3.)
Example 2 Simplex Method
Find the maximum value of p = 12x + 15y + 5z, subject to the constraints:
2x + 2y + z ≤8
x + 4y −3z ≤12
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0
Solution Following Step 1, we introduce slack variables and rewrite the constraints
and objective function in standard form:
2x + 2y + z + s
= 8
x + 4y −3z
+ t
= 12
−12x −15y −5z
+ p = 0
We now follow with Step 2, setting up the initial tableau:

For Step 3, we select the column over the negative number with the largest magnitude in
the bottom row, which is the y column. For Step 4, ﬁnding the pivot, we see that the test
ratios are 8/2 and 12/4, the smallest being 12/4 = 3. So we select the pivot in the t row
and clear its column:

The departing variable is t and the entering variable is y. This gives the second tableau.
We now go back to Step 3. Because we still have negative numbers in the bottom
row, we choose the one with the largest magnitude (which is –65), and thus our pivot
column is the z column. Because negative numbers can’t be pivots, the only possible
choice for the pivot is the 5. (We need not compute the test ratios because there would
only be one from which to choose.) We now clear this column, remembering to take care
of the departing and entering variables.
This gives
Notice how the value of p keeps climbing: It started at 0 in the ﬁrst tableau, went up to
180/4 = 45 in the second, and is currently at 232/4 = 58. Because there are no more
negative numbers in the bottom row, we are done and can write down the solution: p has
a maximum value of 232
4 = 58, and this occurs when
x = 0
y = 72
20 = 18
5
and
z = 4
5
The slack variables are both zero.
As a partial check on our answer, we can substitute these values into the objective
function and the constraints:
58 = 12(0) + 15(18/5) + 5(4/5)
✔
2(0) + 2(18/5) + (4/5) = 8 ≤8
✔
0 + 4(18/5) −3(4/5) = 12 ≤12
✔

293
We say that this is only a partial check, because it shows only that our solution is feasi-
ble, and that we have correctly calculated p. It does not show that we have the optimal
solution. This check will usually catch any arithmetic mistakes we make, but it is not
foolproof.
Applications
In the next example (further exploits of Acme Baby Foods—compare Example 2 in Sec-
tion 2) we show how the simplex method relates to the graphical method.
Example 3 Resource Allocation
Acme Baby Foods makes two puddings, vanilla and chocolate. Each serving of vanilla
pudding requires 2 teaspoons of sugar and 25 ﬂuid ounces of water, and each serving of
chocolate pudding requires 3 teaspoons of sugar and 15 ﬂuid ounces of water. Acme has
available each day 3600 teaspoons of sugar and 22,500 ﬂuid ounces of water. Acme
makes no more than 600 servings of vanilla pudding because that is all that it can sell
each day. If Acme makes a proﬁt of 10¢ on each serving of vanilla pudding and 7¢ on
each serving of chocolate, how many servings of each should it make to maximize its
proﬁt?
Solution We ﬁrst identify the unknowns. Let
x = the number of servings of vanilla pudding
y = the number of servings of chocolate pudding
The objective function is the proﬁt p = 10x + 7y, which we need to maximize. For the
constraints, we start with the fact that Acme will make no more than 600 servings of
vanilla: x ≤600. We can put the remaining data in a table as follows:
Vanilla
Chocolate
Total Available
Sugar (teaspoons)
2
3
3600
Water (ounces)
25
15
22,500
Because Acme can use no more sugar and water than is available, we get the two con-
straints:
2x + 3y ≤3600
25x + 15y ≤22,500
Note that all the terms are divisible by 5.
Thus our linear programming problem is this:
Maximize
p = 10x + 7y
subject to
x ≤600
2x + 3y ≤3600
5x + 3y ≤4500
We divided 25x + 15y ≤22,500 by 5.
x ≥0, y ≥0

Next, we introduce the slack variables and set up the initial tableau.

= 600
2x + 3y
+ t
= 3600
5x + 3y
+ u
= 4500
−10x −7y
+ p = 0
Note that we have had to introduce a third slack variable, u. There need to be as
many slack variables as there are constraints (other than those of the x ≥0 variety).
Q: What do the slack variables say about Acme puddings ?
A: The first slack variable, s, represents the number you must add to the number of servings of
vanilla pudding actually made to obtain the maximum of 600 servings. The second slack
variable, t, represents the amount of sugar that is left over once the puddings are made, and u
represents the amount of water left over. ■
We now use the simplex method to solve the problem:
Thus, the solution is as follows: The maximum value of p is 90,000/9 = 10,000¢ =
$100, which occurs when x = 900/3 = 300, and y = 9000/9 = 1000. (The slack vari-
ables are s = 900/3 = 300 and t = u = 0.)

4.3 The Simplex Method: Solving Standard Maximization Problems
295
+Before we go on... Because the problem in Example 3 had only two variables, we could
have solved it graphically. It is interesting to think about the relationship between the
two methods. Figure 22 shows the feasible region. Each tableau in the simplex method
corresponds to a corner of the feasible region, given by the corresponding basic solu-
tion. In this example, the sequence of basic solutions is
(x,y) = (0, 0), (600, 0), (600, 500), (300, 1000)
This is the sequence of corners shown in Figure 23. In general, we can think of the sim-
plex method as walking from corner to corner of the feasible region, until it locates the
optimal solution. In problems with many variables and many constraints, the simplex
method usually visits only a small fraction of the total number of corners.
We can also explain again, in a different way, the reason we use the test ratios when
choosing the pivot. For example, when choosing the ﬁrst pivot we had to choose among
the test ratios 600, 1800, and 900 (look at the ﬁrst tableau). In Figure 22, you can see that
those are the three x-intercepts of the lines that bound the feasible region. If we had cho-
sen 1800 or 900, we would have jumped along the x-axis to a point outside of the feasi-
ble region, which we do not want to do. In general, the test ratios measure the distance
from the current corner to the constraint lines, and we must choose the smallest such
distance to avoid crossing any of them into the unfeasible region.
It is also interesting in an application like this to think about the values of the slack
variables. We said above that s is the difference between the maximum 600 servings of
vanilla that might be made and the number that is actually made. In the optimal solution,
s = 300, which says that 300 fewer servings of vanilla were made than the maximum
possible. Similarly, t was the amount of sugar left over. In the optimal solution, t = 0,
which tells us that all of the available sugar is used. Finally, u = 0, so all of the available
water is used as well. ■

Summary: The Simplex Method for Standard Maximization Problems
To solve a standard maximization problem using the simplex method, we take the fol-
lowing steps:
1. Convert to a system of equations by introducing slack variables to turn the con-
straints into equations and by rewriting the objective function in standard form.
2. Write down the initial tableau.
3. Select the pivot column: Choose the negative number with the largest magnitude in
the left-hand side of the bottom row. Its column is the pivot column. (If there are two
or more candidates, choose any of them.) If all the numbers in the left-hand side of
the bottom row are zero or positive, then we are ﬁnished, and the basic solution max-
imizes the objective function. (See below for the basic solution.)
4. Select the pivot in the pivot column: The pivot must always be a positive number. For
each positive entry b in the pivot column, compute the ratio a/b, where a is the num-
ber in the last column in that row. Of these test ratios, choose the smallest one. The
corresponding number b is the pivot.
5. Use the pivot to clear the column in the normal manner (taking care to follow the
exact prescription for formulating the row operations described in Chapter 2) and
then relabel the pivot row with the label from the pivot column. The variable

A: Here, the pivot column is the x column, but there is no suitable entry for a pivot (because
zeros and negative numbers can’t be pivots). This happens when the feasible region is un-
bounded and there is also no optimal solution. In other words, p can be made as large as we like
without violating the constraints. ■
Q: What should we do if there is a negative number in the rightmost column?
A: A negative number will not appear above the bottom row in the rightmost column if we fol-
low the procedure correctly. (The bottom right entry is allowed to be negative if the objective
takes on negative values as in a negative profit, or loss.) Following are the most likely errors
leading to this situation:
• The pivot was chosen incorrectly (don’t forget to choose the smallest test ratio). When this
mistake is made, one or more of the variables will be negative in the corresponding basic
solution.
• The row operation instruction was written backwards or performed backwards (for example,
instead of R2 −R1, it was R1 −R2). This mistake can be corrected by multiplying the row
by –1.
• An arithmetic error occurred. (We all make those annoying errors from time to time.) ■
Q: What about zeros in the rightmost column?
A: Zeros are permissible in the rightmost column. For example, the constraint x −y ≤0 will
lead to a zero in the rightmost column. ■
Q: What happens if we choose a pivot column other than the one with the most negative
number in the bottom row?
A: There is no harm in doing this as long as we choose the pivot in that column using the
smallest test ratio. All it might do is slow the whole calculation by adding extra steps. ■
originally labeling the pivot row is the departing, or exiting, variable, and the vari-
able labeling the column is the entering variable.
6. Go to step 3.
To get the basic solution corresponding to any tableau in the simplex method, set
to zero all variables that do not appear as row labels. The value of a variable that
does appear as a row label (an active variable) is the number in the rightmost col-
umn in that row divided by the number in that row in the column labeled by the same
variable.

120 cups of milk, and 200 cups of cream. You make a proﬁt of
$3 on each batch of Creamy Vanilla, $2 on each batch of Con-
tinental Mocha and $4 on each batch of Succulent Strawberry.
a. How many batches of each ﬂavor should you make to
maximize your proﬁt?
b. In your answer to part (a), have you used all the ingredients?
c. Due to the poor strawberry harvest this year, you cannot
make more than 10 batches of Succulent Strawberry.
Does this affect your maximum proﬁt?
27. ● Agriculture Your small farm encompasses 100 acres, and
you are planning to grow tomatoes, lettuce, and carrots in the
coming planting season. Fertilizer costs per acre are: $5 for
tomatoes, $4 for lettuce, and $2 for carrots. Based on past ex-
perience, you estimate that each acre of tomatoes will require
an average of 4 hours of labor per week, while tending to let-
tuce and carrots will each require an average of 2 hours per
week. You estimate a proﬁt of $2000 for each acre of toma-
toes, $1500 for each acre of lettuce, and $500 for each acre of
carrots. You can afford to spend no more than $400 on fertil-
izer, and your farm laborers can supply up to 500 hours per
week. How many acres of each crop should you plant to max-
imize total proﬁts? In this event, will you be using all 100
acres of your farm?
28. ●Agriculture Your farm encompasses 500 acres, and you are
planning to grow soy beans, corn, and wheat in the coming
planting season. Fertilizer costs per acre are: $5 for soy beans,
$2 for corn, and $1 for wheat.You estimate that each acre of soy
beans will require an average of 5 hours of labor per week,
while tending to corn and wheat will each require an average of
2 hours per week. Based on past yields and current market
prices, you estimate a proﬁt of $3000 for each acre of soy beans,
$2000 for each acre of corn, and $1000 for each acre of wheat.
You can afford to spend no more than $3000 on fertilizer, and
your farm laborers can supply 3000 hours per week. How many
acres of each crop should you plant to maximize total proﬁts?
In this event, will you be using all the available labor?
29. ● Resource Allocation (Note that the following exercise is
almost identical to Exercise 8 in Section 2.3, except for one
important detail. Refer back to your solution of that prob-
lem—if you did it—and then attempt this one.) The Enor-
mous State University Choral Society is planning its annual
Song Festival, when it will serve three kinds of delicacies:
granola treats, nutty granola treats, and nuttiest granola treats.
The following table shows some of the ingredients required
(in ounces) for a single serving of each delicacy, as well as the
total amount of each ingredient available.

The society makes a proﬁt of $6 on each serving of granola,
$8 on each serving of nutty granola, and $3 on each serving
of nuttiest granola. Assuming that the Choral Society can sell
all that they make, how many servings of each will maximize
proﬁts? How much of each ingredient will be left over?
30. ● Resource Allocation Repeat the preceding exercise, but this
time assume that the Choral Society makes a $3 proﬁt on each
of its delicacies.
31. ● Recycling Safety-Kleen operates the world’s largest oil re-
reﬁnery at Elgin, Illinois. You have been hired by the company
to determine how to allocate its intake of up to 50 million gal-
lons of used oil to its three reﬁnery processes: A, B, and C.
You are told that electricity costs for process A amount to
$150,000 per million gallons treated, while for processes B
and C, the costs are respectively $100,000 and $50,000 per
million gallons treated. Process A can recover 60 percent of
the used oil, process B can recover 55 percent, and process C
can recover only 50 percent. Assuming a revenue of $4 mil-
lion per million gallons of recovered oil and an annual electri-
cal budget of $3 million, how much used oil would you allo-
cate to each process in order to maximize total revenues?22
32. ● Recycling Repeat the preceding exercise, but this time assume
that process C can handle only up to 20 million gallons per year.

the table above to obtain a 10-day supply that gives you the
maximum possible amount of creatine, but no more than 1000

35. You are planning to invest up to $10,000 in IBM, HPQ, and
AAPL shares. You desire to maximize your share of the com-
panies’ earnings but, for tax reasons, want to earn no more
than $200 in dividends. Your broker suggests that because
AAPL stocks pay no dividends, you should invest only in
AAPL. Is she right?
36. Repeat Exercise 35 under the assumption that IBM stocks
have climbed to $120 on speculation, but its dividend yield
and EPS (earnings per share) are unchanged.

Ex Loan Planning25 Enormous State University’s em-

Your broker has made the following suggestions:
• At least 50 percent of your total investment should be in
CMBFX.
• No more than 10 percent of your total investment should be
in PNF.
How much should you invest in each fund to maximize your
anticipated returns while following your broker’s advice?
39. Portfolio Management If x dollars is invested in a company
that controls, say, 30 percent of the market with 5 brand-
names, then 0.30x is a measure of market exposure and 5x is
a measure of brand-name exposure. Now suppose you are a
broker at a large securities ﬁrm, and one of your clients would
like to invest up to $100,000 in recording industry stocks. You
decide to recommend a combination of stocks in four of the
world’s largest companies: Warner Music, Universal Music,
Sony, and EMI. (See the table.27)

You would like your client’s brand-name exposure to be as large
as possible but his total market exposure to be $15,000 or less.
(This would reﬂect an average of 15 percent.) Furthermore,

you would like at least 20 percent of the investment to be in
Universal because you feel that its control of the DGG and
Phillips labels is advantageous for its classical music opera-
tions. How much should you advise your client to invest in
each company?
40. Portfolio Management Referring to Exercise 39, suppose
instead that you wanted your client to maximize his total mar-
ket exposure but limit his brand-name exposure to 1.5 million
or less (representing an average of 15 labels or fewer per
company), and still invest at least 20 percent of the total in
Universal. How much should you advise your client to invest
in each company?
41.
Ex Transportation Scheduling (This exercise is almost
identical to Exercise 24 in Section 2.3 but is more realistic;
one cannot always expect to ﬁll all orders exactly, and keep
all plants operating at 100 percent capacity.) The Tubular
Ride Boogie Board Company has manufacturing plants in
Tucson, Arizona, and Toronto, Ontario. You have been given
the job of coordinating distribution of the latest model, the
Gladiator, to their outlets in Honolulu and Venice Beach. The
Tucson plant, when operating at full capacity, can manufac-
ture 620 Gladiator boards per week, while the Toronto plant,
beset by labor disputes, can produce only 410 boards per
week. The outlet in Honolulu orders 500 Gladiator boards
per week, while Venice Beach orders 530 boards per week.
Transportation costs are as follows: Tucson to Honolulu: $10
per board; Tucson to Venice Beach: $5 per board; Toronto to
Honolulu: $20 per board; Toronto to Venice Beach: $10 per
board. Your manager has informed you that the company’s
total transportation budget is $6550. You realize that it may
not be possible to ﬁll all the orders, but you would like the
total number of boogie boards shipped to be as large as pos-
sible. Given this, how many Gladiator boards should you
order shipped from each manufacturing plant to each distrib-
ution outlet?

4.4 The Simplex Method: Solving General
Linear Programming Problems
As we saw in Section 4.2, not all LP problems are standard maximization problems. We
might have constraints like 2x + 3y ≥4 or perhaps 2x + 3y = 4. Or, you might have to
minimize, rather than maximize, the objective function. General problems like this are
almost as easy to deal with as the standard kind: There is a modiﬁcation of the simplex
method that works very nicely. The best way to illustrate it is by means of examples.
First, we discuss nonstandard maximization problems.
Nonstandard Maximization Problems
Example 1 Maximizing with Mixed Constraints
Maximize
p = 4x + 12y + 6z
subject to
x +
y + z ≤100
4x + 10y + 7z ≤480
x +
y + z ≥60
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0
Solution We begin by turning the ﬁrst two inequalities into equations as usual because
they have the standard form. We get
x +
y + z + s
= 100
4x + 10y + 7z
+ t = 480
We are tempted to use a slack variable for the third inequality, x + y + z ≥60, but
adding something positive to the left-hand side will not make it equal to the right: It will
get even bigger. To make it equal to 60, we must subtract some nonnegative number. We
will call this number u (because we have already used s and t) and refer to u as a surplus
variable rather than a slack variable. Thus, we write
x + y + z −u = 60
Continuing with the setup, we have
x +
y + z + s
= 100
4x + 10y + 7z
+ t
= 480
x +
y + z
−u
= 60
−4x −12y −6z
+ p = 0
This leads to the initial tableau:

We put a star next to the third row because the basic solution corresponding to this
tableau is
x = y = z = 0, s = 100, t = 480, u = 60/(−1) = −60

The Simplex Method for General Linear Programming Problems
Star all rows that give a negative value for the associated active variable (except for the
objective variable, which is allowed to be negative). If there are starred rows, you will
need to begin with Phase I.
Phase I: Getting into the Feasible Region (Getting Rid of the Stars)
In the ﬁrst starred row, ﬁnd the largest positive number. Use test ratios as in Section 4.3
to ﬁnd the pivot in that column (exclude the bottom row), and then pivot on that entry. (If
the lowest ratio occurs both in a starred row and an un-starred row, pivot in a starred row
rather than the un-starred one.) Check to see which rows should now be starred. Repeat
until no starred rows remain, and then go on to Phase II.
Phase II: Use the Simplex Method for Standard Maximization Problems
If there are any negative entries on the left side of the bottom row after Phase I, use the
method described in the preceding section.
4.4 The Simplex Method: Solving General Linear Programming Problems
303
Several things are wrong here. First, the values x = y = z = 0 do not satisfy the third
inequality x + y + z ≥60. Thus, this basic solution is not feasible. Second—and this is
really the same problem—the surplus variable u is negative, whereas we said that it
should be nonnegative. The star next to the row labeled u alerts us to the fact that the pre-
sent basic solution is not feasible and that the problem is located in the starred row,
where the active variable u is negative.
Whenever an active variable is negative, we star the corresponding row. 
In setting up the initial tableau, we star those rows coming from ≥inequalities. 
The simplex method as described in the preceding section assumed that we began
in the feasible region, but now we do not. Our ﬁrst task is to get ourselves into the fea-
sible region. In practice, we can think of this as getting rid of the stars on the rows. Once
we get into the feasible region, we go back to the method of the preceding section. 
There are several ways to get into the feasible region. The method we have chosen
is one of the simplest to state and carry out. (We will see why this method works at the
end of the example.)
Because there is a starred row, we need to use Phase I. The largest positive number
in the starred row is 1, which occurs three times. Arbitrarily select the ﬁrst, which is in
the ﬁrst column. In that column, the smallest test ratio happens to be given by the 1 in
the u row, so this is our ﬁrst pivot.

Notice that we removed the star from row 3. To see why, look at the basic solution given
by this tableau:
x = 60, y = 0, z = 0, s = 40, t = 240, u = 0
None of the variables is negative anymore, so there are no rows to star. The basic solu-
tion is therefore feasible—it satisﬁes all the constraints.
Now that there are no more stars, we have completed Phase I, so we proceed to
Phase II, which is just the method of the preceding section.

And we are ﬁnished. Thus the solution is
p = 1680/3 = 560, x = 120/6 = 20, y = 240/6 = 40, z = 0
The slack and surplus variables are
s = 40, t = 0, u = 0
Before we go on... We owe you an explanation of why this method works. When we
perform a pivot in Phase I, one of two things will happen. As in Example 1, we may
pivot in a starred row. In that case, the negative active variable in that row will become
inactive (hence zero) and some other variable will be made active with a positive value
because we are pivoting on a positive entry. Thus, at least one star will be eliminated.
(We will not introduce any new stars because pivoting on the entry with the smallest test
ratio will keep all nonnegative variables nonnegative.)
The second possibility is that we may pivot on some row other than a starred row.
Choosing the pivot via test ratios again guarantees that no new starred rows are created.
A little bit of algebra shows that the value of the negative variable in the ﬁrst starred row
must increase toward zero. (Choosing the largest positive entry in the starred row will
make it a little more likely that we will increase the value of that variable as much as
possible; the rationale for choosing the largest entry is the same as that for choosing the
most negative entry in the bottom row during Phase II.) Repeating this procedure as nec-
essary, the value of the variable must eventually become zero or positive, assuming that
there are feasible solutions to begin with.
So, one way or the other, we can eventually get rid of all of the stars. ■

The basic solution is x = 25, y = 10, s = 0, t = 15, u = 0/(−1) = 0, and v = 0. Be-
cause there are no negative variables left (even u has become 0), we are in the feasible
region, so we can go on to Phase II, shown next. (Filling in the instructions for the row
operations is an exercise.)
The optimal solution is
x = 25, y = 35/2 = 17.5, p = 135/2 = 67.5
(s = 7.5, t = 0, u = 7.5)

Minimization Problems
Now that we know how to deal with nonstandard constraints, we consider minimization
problems, problems in which we have to minimize, rather than maximize, the objective
function. The idea is to convert a minimization problem into a maximization problem,
which we can then solve as usual. 
Suppose, for instance, we want to minimize c = 10x −30y subject to some con-
straints. The technique is as follows: deﬁne a new variable p by taking p to be the nega-
tive of c, so that p = −c. Then, the larger we make p, the smaller c becomes. For
example, if we can make p increase from −10 to −5, then c will decrease from 10 to 5.
So, if we are looking for the smallest value of c, we might as well look for the largest
value of p instead. More concisely,
Minimizing c is the same as maximizing p = −c.
Now because c = 10x −30y, we have p = −10x + 30y, and the requirement that we
“minimize c = 10x −30y” is now replaced by “maximize p = −10x + 30y.”

+Before we go on... Because Example 2 had only two unknowns, we can picture the se-
quence of basic solutions on the graph of the feasible region. This is shown in Figure 24.
You can see that there was no way to jump from (0, 0) in the initial tableau directly
into the feasible region because the ﬁrst jump must be along an axis. (Why?) Also no-
tice that the third jump did not move at all. To which step of the simplex method does
this correspond? ■
quick Example
Example 3 Purchasing
You are in charge of ordering furniture for your company’s new headquarters. You need
to buy at least 200 tables, 500 chairs, and 300 computer desks. Wall-to-Wall Furniture
(WWF) is offering a package of 20 tables, 25 chairs, and 18 computer desks for $2000,
whereas rival Acme Furniture (AF) is offering a package of 10 tables, 50 chairs, and 24
computer desks for $3000. How many packages should you order from each company
to minimize your total cost?
Solution The unknowns here are
x = number of packages ordered from WWF
y = number of packages ordered from AF
Minimization Problems
We convert a minimization problem into a maximization problem by taking the negative
of the objective function. All the constraints remain unchanged.

From this table we get the following LP problem:

subject to
20x + 10y ≥200
25x + 50y ≥500
18x + 24y ≥300
x ≥0, y ≥0
Before we start solving this problem, notice that all inequalities may be simpliﬁed.
The ﬁrst is divisible by 10, the second by 25, and the third by 6. (However, this affects
the meaning of the surplus variables; see Before we go on below.) Dividing gives the fol-
lowing simpler problem:
Minimize c = 2000x + 3000y
subject to
2x + y ≥20
x + 2y ≥20
3x + 4y ≥50
x ≥0, y ≥0
Following the discussion that preceded this example, we convert to a maximization

FAQs
When to Switch to Phase II, Equality Constraints, 
and Troubleshooting
Q: How do I know when to switch to Phase II?
A: After each step, check the basic solution for starred rows. You are not ready to proceed with
Phase II until all the stars are gone. ■
Q: How do I deal with an equality constraint, such as 2x + 7y −z = 90?
A: Although we haven’t given examples of equality constraints, they can be treated by the
following trick: Replace an equality by two inequalities. For example, replace the equality
2x + 7y −z = 90 by the two inequalities 2x + 7y −z ≤90 and 2x + 7y −z ≥90. A little
thought will convince you that these two inequalities amount to the same thing as the original
equality! ■
Q: What happens if it is impossible to choose a pivot using the instructions in Phase I?
A: In that case, the LP problem has no solution. In fact, the feasible region is empty. If it is
impossible to choose a pivot in phase II, then the feasible region is unbounded and there is no
optimal solution. ■

+Before we go on... The surplus variables in the preceding example represent pieces of
furniture over and above the minimum requirements. The order you place will give you
50 extra tables (s = 5, but s was introduced after we divided the ﬁrst inequality by 10,
so the actual surplus is 10 × 5 = 50), the correct number of chairs (t = 0), and the cor-
rect number of computer desks (u = 0). ■
The preceding LP problem is an example of a standard minimization problem—
in a sense the opposite of a standard maximization problem: We are minimizing an ob-
jective function, where all the constraints have the form Ax + By + Cz + · · · ≥N . We
will discuss standard minimization problems more fully in Section 4.5, as well as an-
other method of solving them.

37. Subsidies The Miami Beach City Council has offered to sub-
sidize hotel development in Miami Beach, and it is hoping
for at least two hotels with a total capacity of at least 1400.
Suppose that you are a developer interested in taking advan-
tage of this offer by building a small group of hotels in Miami
Beach. You are thinking of three prototypes: a convention-
style hotel with 500 rooms costing $100 million, a vacation-
style hotel with 200 rooms costing $20 million, and a small
motel with 50 rooms costing $4 million. The City Council
will approve your plans, provided you build at least one con-
vention-style hotel and no more than two small motels. 
a. How many of each type of hotel should you build to sat-
isfy the city council’s wishes and stipulations while mini-
mizing your total cost? 
b. Now assume that the city council will give developers
20 percent of the cost of building new hotels in Miami
Beach, up to $50 million.35 Will the city’s $50 million
subsidy be sufﬁcient to cover 20 percent of your total costs?
38. Subsidies Refer back to the preceding exercise. You are about

a. How many of each type of hotel should you build to sat-

latest model, the Gladiator, to their outlets in Honolulu and
Venice Beach. The Tucson plant can manufacture up to 620
boards per week, while the Toronto plant, beset by labor dis-
putes, can produce no more than 410 Gladiator boards per
week. The outlet in Honolulu orders 500 Gladiator boards per
week, while Venice Beach orders 530 boards per week. Trans-
portation costs are as follows: Tucson to Honolulu:
$10/board; Tucson to Venice Beach: $5/board; Toronto to
Honolulu: $20/board; Toronto to Venice Beach: $10/board.

41. Finance Senator Porkbarrel habitually overdraws his three
bank accounts, at the Congressional Integrity Bank, Citizens’
Trust, and Checks R Us. There are no penalties because the
overdrafts are subsidized by the taxpayer. The Senate Ethics
Committee tends to let slide irregular banking activities as
long as they are not ﬂagrant. At the moment (due to Congress’
preoccupation with a Supreme Court nominee), a total over-
draft of up to $10,000 will be overlooked. Porkbarrel’s con-
science makes him hesitate to overdraw accounts at banks
whose names include expressions like “integrity” and “citi-
zens’ trust.” The effect is that his overdrafts at the ﬁrst two
banks combined amount to no more than one-quarter of the
total. On the other hand, the ﬁnancial ofﬁcers at Integrity
Bank, aware that Senator Porkbarrel is a member of the Sen-
ate Banking Committee, “suggest” that he overdraw at least
$2500 from their bank. Find the amount he should overdraw
from each bank in order to avoid investigation by the Ethics
Committee and overdraw his account at Integrity by as much
as his sense of guilt will allow. 
42. Scheduling Because Joe Slim’s brother was recently elected
to the State Senate, Joe’s ﬁnancial advisement concern, Inside
Information Inc., has been doing a booming trade, even
though the ﬁnancial counseling he offers is quite worthless.
(None of his seasoned clients pays the slightest attention to
his advice.) Slim charges different hourly rates to different
categories of individuals: $5000/hour for private citizens,
$50,000/hour for corporate executives, and $10,000/hour for
presidents of universities. Due to his taste for leisure, he feels
that he can spend no more than 40 hours/week in consultation.
On the other hand, Slim feels that it would be best for his in-
tellect were he to devote at least 10 hours of consultation each
week to university presidents. However, Slim always feels
somewhat uncomfortable dealing with academics, so he
would prefer to spend no more than half his consultation time
with university presidents. Furthermore, he likes to think of
himself as representing the interests of the common citizen,
so he wishes to offer at least 2 more hours of his time each
week to private citizens than to corporate executives and uni-
versity presidents combined. Given all these restrictions, how
many hours each week should he spend with each type of
client in order to maximize his income?

Ex Hospital Stafﬁng As the staff director of a new hos-

specialists, and infectious disease specialists. According to
recent data, each cardiology case averages $12,000 in rev-
enue, each physical rehabilitation case $19,000, and each in-
fectious disease case, $14,000.38You judge that each special-
ist you employ will expand the hospital caseload by about 10
patients per week. You already have 3 cardiologists on staff,
and the hospital is equipped to admit up to 200 patients per
week. Based on past experience, each cardiologist and reha-
bilitation specialist brings in one government research grant
per year, while each infectious disease specialist brings in
three. Your board of directors would like to see a total of at
least 30 grants per year and would like your weekly revenue
to be as large as possible. How many of each kind of special-
ist should you hire? 
46.
Ex Hospital Stafﬁng Referring to Exercise 45, you

that each cardiologist brought in 120 new patients per year,
each rehabilitation specialist brought in 90 per year, and each
infectious disease specialist brought in 70 per year.39 It also
turned out that your hospital could deal with no more than
1960 new patients per year. Repeat the preceding exercise in
the light of this corrected data.

The Simplex Method and Duality (OPTIONAL)
We mentioned standard minimization problems in the last section. These problems
have the following form.
Standard Minimization Problem
A standard minimization problem is an LP problem in which we are required to min-
imize (not maximize) a linear objective function
c = as + bt + cu + · · ·
of the variables s, t, u, . . . (in this section, we will always use the letters s, t, u, . . . for
the unknowns in a standard minimization problem) subject to the constraints
s ≥0, t ≥0, u ≥0, . . .
and further constraints of the form
As + Bt + Cu + · · · ≥N
where A, B, C, . . . and N are numbers with N nonnegative.
A standard linear programming problem is an LP problem that is either a stan-
dard maximization problem or a standard minimization problem. An LP problem satis-
ﬁes the nonnegative objective condition if all the coefﬁcients in the objective function
are nonnegative.

We saw a way of solving minimization problems in Section 4.4, but a mathemati-
cally elegant relationship between maximization and minimization problems gives us
another way of solving minimization problems that satisfy the nonnegative objective
condition. This relationship is called duality.
To describe duality, we must ﬁrst represent an LP problem by a matrix. This matrix
is not the ﬁrst tableau but something simpler: Pretend you forgot all about slack variables
and also forgot to change the signs of the objective function.40 As an example, consider
the following two standard41 problems.
Problem 1
Maximize
p = 20x + 20y + 50z
subject to
2x + y + 3z ≤2000
x + 2y + 4z ≤3000
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0

Notice that the coefﬁcients of the objective function go in the bottom row and we place
a zero in the bottom right corner.

condition.
This is a standard maximization problem

condition.
This is a standard minimization problem
that does not satisfy the nonnegative
objective condition.
40 Forgetting these things is exactly what happens to many students under test conditions!
41 Although duality does not require the problems to be standard, it does require them to be written in so-called
standard form: in the case of a maximization problem all constraints need to be (re)written using ≤, while for
a minimization problem all constraints need to be (re)written using ≥. It is least confusing to stick with stan-
dard problems, which is what we will do in this section.

These two problems are related: the matrix for Problem 1 is the transpose of the ma-
trix for Problem 2. (Recall that the transpose of a matrix is obtained by writing its rows
as columns; see Section 3.1.) When we have a pair of LP problems related in this way,
we say that the two are dual LP problems.

Dual Linear Programming Problems
Two LP problems, one a maximization and one a minimization problem, are dual if the
matrix that represents one is the transpose of the matrix that represents the other.
Finding the Dual of a Given Problem
Given an LP problem, we ﬁnd its dual as follows:
1. Represent the problem as a matrix (see above).
2. Take the transpose of the matrix.
3. Write down the dual, which is the LP problem corresponding to the new matrix. If the
original problem was a maximization problem, its dual will be a minimization prob-
lem, and vice versa.
The original problem is called the primal problem, and its dual is referred to as the
dual problem.

The following theorem justiﬁes what we have been doing, and says that solving the
dual problem of an LP problem is equivalent to solving the original problem.
Fundamental Theorem of Duality
a. If an LP problem has an optimal solution, then so does its dual. Moreover, the pri-
mal problem and the dual problem have the same optimal value for their objective
functions.
b. Contained in the ﬁnal tableau of the simplex method applied to an LP problem is the
solution to its dual problem: It is given by the bottom entries in the columns associ-
ated with the slack variables, divided by the entry under the objective variable.

The theorem42 gives us an alternative way of solving minimization problems that
satisfy the nonnegative objective condition. Let’s illustrate by solving Problem 2 above.

Chapter 4
Linear Programming
42 The proof of the theorem is beyond the scope of this book but can be found in a textbook devoted to linear pro-
gramming, like Linear Programming by Vasˇek Chvátal (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman and Co., 1983,) which has
a particularly well-motivated discussion.

maximization problem, we do not have to worry about Phase I but go straight to Phase II.

Note that the maximum value of the objective function is p = 105,000/3 = 35,000. By
the theorem, this is also the optimal value of c in the primal problem!

Before we go on... Can you now see the reason for using the variable names s, t, u, . . .
in standard minimization problems? ■
Q: Is the theorem also useful for solving problems that do not satisfy the nonnegative objective
condition?
A: Consider a standard minimization problem that does not satisfy the nonnegative objective
condition, such as
Minimize
c = 2s −t
subject to
2s + 3t ≥2
s + 2t ≥2
s ≥0, t ≥0
Its dual would be
Maximize
p = 2x + 2y
subject to
2x + y ≤2
3x + 2y ≤−1
x ≥0, y ≥0
This is not a standard maximization problem because the right-hand side of the second con-
straint is negative. In general, if a problem does not satisfy the nonnegative condition, its dual
is not standard. Therefore, to solve the dual by the simplex method will require using Phase I
as well as Phase II, and we may as well just solve the primal problem that way to begin with.
Thus, duality helps us solve problems only when the primal problem satisfies the nonnegative
objective condition. ■
In many economic applications, the solution to the dual problem also gives us use-
ful information about the primal problem, as we will see in the following example.
4.5 The Simplex Method and Duality (OPTIONAL)

Step 3 Read off the solution to the primal problem by dividing the bottom entries in
the columns associated with the slack variables by the entry in the p column. Here is

(Compare this with the method we used to solve Example 3 in the preceding section.
Which method seems more efﬁcient?) 
Example 2 Shadow Costs
You are trying to decide how many vitamin pills to take. SuperV brand vitamin pills each
contain 2 milligrams of vitamin X, 1 milligram of vitamin Y, and 1 milligram of vita-
min Z. Topper brand vitamin pills each contain 1 milligram of vitamin X, 1 milligram of
+

Chapter 4
Linear Programming
vitamin Y, and 2 milligrams of vitamin Z. You want to take enough pills daily to get at least
12 milligrams of vitamin X, 10 milligrams of vitamin Y, and 12 milligrams of vitamin Z.
However, SuperV pills cost 4¢ each and Toppers cost 3¢ each, and you would like to min-
imize the total cost of your daily dosage. How many of each brand of pill should you take?
How would changing your daily vitamin requirements affect your minimum cost?
Solution This is a straightforward minimization problem. The unknowns are
s = number of SuperV brand pills
t = number of Topper brand pills
The linear programming problem is
Minimize
c = 4s + 3t
subject to
2s + t ≥12
s + t ≥10
s + 2t ≥12
s ≥0, t ≥0
We solve this problem by using the simplex method on its dual, which is
Maximize
p = 12x + 10y + 12z
subject to
2x + y + z ≤4
x + y + 2z ≤3
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0
After pivoting three times, we arrive at the ﬁnal tableau:

Therefore, the answer to the original problem is that you should take 2 SuperV vitamin
pills and 8 Toppers at a cost of 32¢ per day.
Now, the key to answering the last question, which asks you to determine how chang-
ing your daily vitamin requirements would affect your minimum cost, is to look at the
solution to the dual problem. From the tableau we see that x = 1, y = 2, and z = 0. To
see what x, y, and z might tell us about the original problem, let’s look at their units. In the
inequality 2x + y + z ≤4, the coefﬁcient 2 of x has units “mg of vitamin X/SuperV
pill,” and the 4 on the right-hand side has units “¢/SuperV pill.” For 2x to have the same
units as the 4 on the right-hand side, x must have units “¢/mg of vitamin X.” Similarly, y
must have units “¢/mg of vitamin Y” and z must have units “¢/mg of vitamin Z.” One can
show (although we will not do it here) that x gives the amount that would be added to the
minimum cost for each increase* of 1 milligram of vitamin X in our daily requirement.
For example, if we were to increase our requirement from 12 milligrams to 14 mil-
ligrams, an increase of 2 milligrams, the minimum cost would change by 2x = 2¢, from
32¢ to 34¢. (Try it; you’ll end up taking 4 SuperV pills and 6 Toppers.) Similarly, each
increase of 1 milligram of vitamin Y in the requirements would increase the cost by
y = 2¢. These costs are called the marginal costs or the shadow costs of the vitamins.
* To be scrupulously correct, this works only for relatively small changes in the requirements, not necessarily
for very large ones.

Game Theory
We return to a topic we discussed in Section 3.4: solving two-person zero-sum games. In
that section, we described how to solve games that could be reduced to 2 × 2 games or
smaller. It turns out that we can solve larger games using linear programming and duality.
We summarize the procedure, work through an example, and then discuss why it works.
4.5 The Simplex Method and Duality (OPTIONAL)
321
What about z = 0? The shadow cost of vitamin Z is 0¢/mg, meaning that you can
increase your requirement of vitamin Z without changing your cost. In fact, the solution
s = 2 and t = 8 provides you with 18 milligrams of vitamin Z, so you can increase the
required amount of vitamin Z up to 18 milligrams without changing the solution at all.
We can also interpret the shadow costs as the effective cost to you of each milligram of
each vitamin in the optimal solution. You are paying 1¢/milligram of vitamin X, 2¢/
milligram of vitamin Y, and getting the vitamin Z for free. This gives a total cost of
1 × 12 + 2 × 10 + 0 × 12 = 32¢, as we know. Again, if you change your requirements
slightly, these are the amounts you will pay per milligram of each vitamin.
Solving a Matrix Game
Step 1 Reduce the payoff matrix by dominance.
Step 2 Add a ﬁxed number k to each of the entries so that they all become nonnegative
and no column is all zero.
Step 3 Write 1s to the right of and below the matrix, and then write down the associ-
ated standard maximization problem. Solve this primal problem using the sim-
plex method.
Step 4 Find the optimal strategies and the expected value as follows:
Column Strategy
1. Express the solution to the primal problem as a column vector.
2. Normalize by dividing each entry of the solution vector by p (which is also the sum
of all the entries).
3. Insert zeros in positions corresponding to the columns deleted during reduction.
Row Strategy
1. Express the solution to the dual problem as a row vector.
2. Normalize by dividing each entry by p, which will once again be the sum of all the
entries.
3. Insert zeros in positions corresponding to the rows deleted during reduction.
Value of the Game: e = 1
p −k.
Example 3 Restaurant Inspector
You manage two restaurants, Tender Steaks Inn (TSI) and Break for a Steak (BFS). Even
though you run the establishments impeccably, the Department of Health has been send-
ing inspectors to your restaurants on a daily basis and ﬁning you for minor infractions.

Chapter 4
Linear Programming
You’ve found that you can head off a ﬁne if you’re present, but you can cover only one
restaurant at a time. The Department of Health, on the other hand, has two inspectors,
who sometimes visit the same restaurant and sometimes split up, one to each restaurant.
The average ﬁnes you have been getting are shown in the following matrix.

should be negative payoffs. Thus, the payoff matrix is the following:
P =

−8000
0
−2000

−10,000
−4000

We follow the steps above to solve the game using the simplex method.
Step 1 There are no dominated rows or columns, so this game does not reduce. 
Step 2 We add k = 10,000 to each entry so that none are negative, getting the follow-
ing new matrix (with no zero column):

2000

The corresponding standard maximization problem is the following.

Thus, you should visit TSI with probability 5/9 and BFS with probability 4/9.

Before we go on... We owe you an explanation of why the procedure we used in
Example 3 works. The main point is to understand how we turn a game into a linear pro-
gramming problem. It’s not hard to see that adding a ﬁxed number k to all the payoffs will
change only the payoff, increasing it by k, and not change the optimal strategies. So let’s
pick up Example 3 from the point where we were considering the following game:
P =

2000
10,000
8000
10,000
0
6000

We are looking for the optimal strategies R and C for the row and column players, re-
spectively; if e is the value of the game, we will have e = RPC. Let’s concentrate ﬁrst
on the column player’s strategy C = [u v w]T , where u, v, and w are the unknowns we
want to ﬁnd. Because e is the value of the game, if the column player uses the optimal
strategy C and the row player uses any old strategy S, the expected value with these
strategies has to be e or better for the column player, so SPC ≤e. Let’s write that out
for two particular choices of S. First, consider S = [1
0]:

Multiplied out, this gives

Next, do the same thing for S = [0 1]:

4.5 The Simplex Method and Duality (OPTIONAL)

+

It turns out that if these two inequalities are true, then SPC ≤e for any S at all, which
is what the column player wants. These are starting to look like constraints in a linear
programming problem, but the e appearing on the right is in the way. We get around this
by dividing by e, which we know to be positive because all of the payoffs are nonnega-
tive and no column is all zero (so the column player can’t force the value of the game to
be 0; here is where we need these assumptions). We get the following inequalities:
2000
	u
e

+ 10,000
	v
e

+ 8000
	w
e

≤1
10,000
	u
e

+ 6000
	w
e

≤1
Now we’re getting somewhere. To make these look even more like linear constraints, we
replace our unknowns u, v, and w with new unknowns, x = u/e, y = v/e, and z = w/e.
Our inequalities then become:
2000x + 10,000y + 8000z ≤1
10,000x
+ 6000z ≤1
What about an objective function? From the point of view of the column player, the objec-
tive is to ﬁnd a strategy that will minimize the expected value e. In order to write e in terms
of our new variables x, y, and z, we use the fact that our original variables, being the entries
in the column strategy, have to add up to 1: u + v + w = 1. Dividing by e gives
u
e + v
e + w
e = 1
e
or
x + y + z = 1
e
Now we notice that, if we maximize p = x + y + z = 1/e, it will have the effect of mini-
mizing e, which is what we want. So, we get the following linear programming problem:
Maximize
p = x + y + z
subject to
2000x + 10,000y + 8000z ≤1
10,000x
+ 6000z ≤1
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0
Why can we say that x, y, and z should all be nonnegative? Because the unknowns u, v,
w, and e must all be nonnegative.
So now, if we solve this linear programming problem to ﬁnd x, y, z, and p, we can
ﬁnd the column player’s optimal strategy by computing u = xe = x/p, v = y/p, and
w = z/p. Moreover, the value of the game is e = 1/p. (If we added k to all the payoffs,
we should now adjust by subtracting k again to ﬁnd the correct value of the game.)
Turning now to the row player’s strategy, if we repeat the above type of argument
from the row player’s viewpoint, we’ll end up with the following linear programming
problem to solve:
Minimize
c = s + t
subject to
2000s + 10,000t ≥1
10,000s
≥1
8000s +
6000t ≥1
s ≥0, t ≥0
This is, of course, the dual to the problem we solved to ﬁnd the column player’s strategy,
so we know that we can read its solution off of the same ﬁnal tableau. The optimal value

of c will be the same as the value of p, so c = 1/e also. The entries in the optimal row
strategy will be s/c and t/c. ■

FAQs
When to Use Duality 
Q: Given a minimization problem, when should I use duality, and when should I use the two-
phase method in Section 4.4?
A: If the original problem satisfies the nonnegative objective condition (none of the coeffi-
cients in the objective function are negative), then you can use duality to convert the problem to
a standard maximization one, which can be solved with the one-phase method. If the original
problem does not satisfy the nonnegative objective condition, then dualizing results in a non-
standard LP problem, so dualizing may not be worthwhile. ■
Q: When is it absolutely necessary to use duality?
A: Never. Duality gives us an efficient but not necessary alternative for solving standard mini-
mization problems. ■

37. Resource Allocation One day Gillian the Magician summoned
the wisest of her women. “Devoted followers,” she began, “I
have a quandary: As you well know, I possess great expertise in
sleep spells and shock spells, but unfortunately, these are prov-
ing to be a drain on my aural energy resources; each sleep spell
costs me 500 pico-shirleys of aural energy, while each shock
spell requires 750 pico-shirleys. Clearly, I would like to hold
my overall expenditure of aural energy to a minimum, and still
meet my commitments in protecting the Sisterhood from the
ever-present threat of trolls. Speciﬁcally, I have estimated that
each sleep spell keeps us safe for an average of 2 minutes, while
every shock spell protects us for about 3 minutes. We certainly
require enough protection to last 24 hours of each day, and pos-
sibly more, just to be safe. At the same time, I have noticed that
each of my sleep spells can immobilize 3 trolls at once, while
one of my typical shock spells (having a narrower range) can
immobilize only 2 trolls at once. We are faced, my sisters, with
an onslaught of 1200 trolls per day! Finally, as you are no doubt
aware, the bylaws dictate that for a Magician of the Order to re-
main in good standing, the number of shock spells must be be-
tween one-quarter and one-third the number of shock and sleep
spells combined. What do I do, oh Wise Ones?”
38. Risk Management The Grand Vizier of the Kingdom of Um is
being blackmailed by numerous individuals and is having a
very difﬁcult time keeping his blackmailers from going public.
He has been keeping them at bay with two kinds of payoff: gold
bars from the Royal Treasury and political favors. Through bit-
ter experience, he has learned that each payoff in gold gives him
peace for an average of about one month, and each political
favor seems to earn him about a month and a half of reprieve.
To maintain his ﬂawless reputation in the court, he feels he can-
not afford any revelations about his tainted past to come to light
within the next year. Thus, it is imperative that his blackmailers
be kept at bay for 12 months. Furthermore, he would like to
keep the number of gold payoffs at no more than one-quarter of
the combined number of payoffs because the outward ﬂow of
gold bars might arouse suspicion on the part of the Royal Trea-
surer. The gold payoffs tend to deplete the Grand Vizier’s travel
budget. (The treasury has been subsidizing his numerous trips
to the Himalayas.) He estimates that each gold bar removed
from the treasury will cost him four trips. On the other hand, be-
cause the administering of political favors tends to cost him
valuable travel time, he suspects that each political favor will
cost him about two trips. Now, he would obviously like to keep
his blackmailers silenced and lose as few trips as possible.
What is he to do? How many trips will he lose in the next year?

their optimal strategies, what is the expected vote?
40. Game Theory—Marketing Your company’s new portable
phone/music player/PDA/bottle washer, the RunMan, will
compete against the established market leader, the iNod, in a
saturated market. (Thus, for each device you sell, one fewer
iNod is sold.) You are planning to launch the RunMan with a
traveling road show, concentrating on two cities, New York
and Boston. The makers of the iNod will do the same to try to
maintain their sales. If, on a given day, you both go to New
York, you will lose 1000 units in sales to the iNod. If you both
go to Boston, you will lose 750 units in sales. On the other
hand, if you go to New York and your competitor to Boston,
you will gain 1500 units in sales from them. If you go to
Boston and they to New York, you will gain 500 units in sales.
What percentage of time should you spend in New York and
what percentage in Boston, and how do you expect your sales
to be affected?
41. Game Theory—Morra Games A three-ﬁnger Morra game is
a game in which two players simultaneously show one, two, or
three ﬁngers at each round. The outcome depends on a prede-
termined set of rules. Here is an interesting example: If the
number of ﬁngers shown by A and B differ by 1, then A loses
one point. If they differ by more than 1, the round is a draw. If
they show the same number of ﬁngers, A wins an amount
equal to the sum of the ﬁngers shown. Determine the optimal
strategy for each player and the expected value of the game.
42. Game Theory—Morra Games Referring to the preceding ex-
ercise, consider the following rules for a three-ﬁnger Morra
game: If the sum of the ﬁngers shown is odd, then A wins an
amount equal to that sum. If the sum is even, B wins the sum.
Determine the optimal strategy for each player and the ex-
pected value of the game.

Ex Game Theory—Military Strategy Colonel Blotto
is a well-known game in military strategy.45 Here is a version
of this game: Colonel Blotto has four regiments under his
command, while his opponent, Captain Kije, has three. The
armies are to try to occupy two locations, and each comman-
der must decide how many regiments to send to each location.
tech
The army that sends more regiments to a location captures that
location as well as the other army’s regiments. If both armies
send the same number of regiments to a location, then there is
a draw. The payoffs are one point for each location captured
and one point for each regiment captured. Find the optimum
strategy for each commander and also the value of the game.

Ex Game Theory—Military Strategy Referring to
the preceding exercise, consider the version of Colonel Blotto
with the same payoffs given there except that Captain Kije
earns two points for each location captured, while Colonel
Blotto continues to earn only one point. Find the optimum
strategy for each commander and also the value of the game.

Exercises
45. ● Give one possible advantage of using duality to solve a stan-
dard minimization problem.
46. ● Multiple choice: To ensure that the dual of a minimization
problem will result in a standard maximization problem, 
(A) The primal problem should satisfy the nonnegative objec-
tive condition.
(B) The primal problem should be a standard minimization
problem.
(C) The primal problem should not satisfy the nonnegative
objective condition.
47. ● Give an example of a standard minimization problem whose
dual is not a standard maximization problem. How would you
go about solving your problem?
48. ● Give an example of a nonstandard minimization problem
whose dual is a standard maximization problem.
49. Solve the following nonstandard minimization problem using
duality. Recall from a footnote in the text that to ﬁnd the dual
you must ﬁrst rewrite all of the constraints using “≥.” The
Miami Beach City Council has offered to subsidize hotel devel-
opment in Miami Beach, and is hoping for at least two hotels
with a total capacity of at least 1400. Suppose that you are a de-
veloper interested in taking advantage of this offer by building a
small group of hotels in Miami Beach. You are thinking of three
prototypes: a convention-style hotel with 500 rooms costing
$100 million, a vacation-style hotel with 200 rooms costing
$20 million, and a small motel with 50 rooms costing $4 mil-
lion. The city council will approve your plans provided you
build at least one convention-style hotel and no more than two
small motels. How many of each type of hotel should you build
to satisfy the city council’s wishes and stipulations while mini-
mizing your total cost?
50. Given a minimization problem, when would you solve it by
applying the simplex method to its dual, and when would you
apply the simplex method to the minimization problem itself?
51. Create an interesting application that leads to a standard max-
imization problem. Solve it using the simplex method and
note the solution to its dual problem. What does the solution
to the dual tell you about your application?

5 romance novels for $50, and Higgins offers a package of 5
horror and 10 romance novels for $80.
28. How many packages should you purchase from each publisher

following statements are possible:
(A) The cost will stay the same.
(B) The cost will increase.
(C) The cost will decrease. 
(D) It will be impossible to meet all the conditions.
(E) The cost will become unbounded.
30. If you wish to meet all the requirements in the preceding ex-
ercise at minimum cost, how many packages should you pur-
chase from each publisher? What is the minimum cost?
31. You are just about to place your orders when your sales man-
ager reminds you that, in addition to all your commitments
above, you had also assured Sean Higgins that you would
spend at least as much on purchases from Higgins as from
Dufﬁn. Now what should you do?
32. Proﬁt Dufﬁn Press, which has become the largest publisher of
books sold at the OHaganBooks.com site, prints three kinds
of books: paperback, quality paperback, and hardcover. The
amounts of paper, ink, and time on the presses required for
each kind of book are given in this table:
schedule. The latest Bulletin of Suburban State University claims
to have added new ﬂexibility to its course requirements, but it
remains as complicated as ever. It reads as follows:
All candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts at SSU
must take at least 120 credits from the Sciences, Fine Arts,
Liberal Arts and Mathematics combined, including at
least as many Science credits as Fine Arts credits, and at
most twice as many Mathematics credits as Science cred-
its, but with Liberal Arts credits exceeding Mathematics
credits by no more than one-third of the number of Fine
Arts credits. 
Science and fine arts credits cost $300 each, and liberal arts
and mathematics credits cost $200 each. John would like to
have Billy Sean meet all the requirements at a minimum total
cost.
34. Set up (without solving) the associated linear programming
problem.

Ex How many of each type of credit should Billy Sean
take? What will the total cost be?
36. Shipping On the same day that the sales department at
Duffin House received an order for 600 packages from the
OHaganBooks.com Texas headquarters, it received an ad-
ditional order for 200 packages from FantasyBooks.com,
based in California. Dufﬁn House has warehouses in New
York and Illinois. The New York warehouse has 600 pack-
ages in stock, but the Illinois warehouse is closing down and
has only 300 packages in stock. Shipping costs per package
of books are as follows: New York to Texas: $20; New York
to California: $50; Illinois to Texas: $30; Illinois to Califor-
nia: $40. What is the lowest total shipping cost for which
Dufﬁn House can ﬁll the orders? How many packages
should be sent from each warehouse to each online book-
store at a minimum shipping cost?
37. Marketing Marjory Duffin, head of Duffin House, reveals
to John O’Hagan that FantasyBooks.com is considering
several promotional schemes: It may offer two books for
the price of one, three books for the price of two, or possi-
bly a free copy of Brain Surgery for Klutzes with each
order. O’Hagan’s marketing advisers Floody and O’Lara
seem to have different ideas as to how to respond. Floody
suggests offering three books for the price of one, while
O’Lara suggests instead offering a free copy of the Finite
Mathematics Student Solutions Manual with every pur-
chase. After a careful analysis, O’Hagan comes up with the
following payoff matrix, where the payoffs represent the
number of customers, in thousands, O’Hagan expects to
gain from FantasyBooks.

Airline Scheduling
You are the trafﬁc manager for Fly-by-Night Airlines,
which ﬂies airplanes from ﬁve cities: Los Angeles,
Chicago, Atlanta, New York, and Boston. Due to a
strike, you have not had sufﬁcient crews to ﬂy your
planes, so some of your planes have been stranded in
Chicago and in Atlanta. In fact, 15 extra planes are in
Chicago and 30 extra planes are in Atlanta. Los Ange-
les needs at least 10 planes to get back on schedule,
New York needs at least 20, and Boston needs at least
10. It costs $50,000 to ﬂy a plane from Chicago to Los
Angeles, $10,000 to ﬂy from Chicago to New York, and $20,000 to ﬂy from Chicago to
Boston. It costs $70,000 to ﬂy a plane from Atlanta to Los Angeles, $20,000 to ﬂy from
Atlanta to New York, and $50,000 to ﬂy from Atlanta to Boston. How should you re-
arrange your planes to get back on schedule at the lowest cost?
As always, you remember to start by identifying the unknowns. You need to decide
how many planes you will ﬂy from each of Chicago and Atlanta to each of Los Angeles,
New York, and Boston. This gives you six unknowns:
x = number of planes to ﬂy from Chicago to LA
y = number of planes to ﬂy from Chicago to NY
z = number of planes to ﬂy from Chicago to Boston
u = number of planes to ﬂy from Atlanta to LA
v = number of planes to ﬂy from Atlanta to NY
w = number of planes to ﬂy from Atlanta to Boston
Los Angeles needs at least 10 planes, so you know that
x + u ≥10
Similarly, New York and Boston give you the inequalities
y + v ≥20
z + w ≥10
Because Chicago has only 15 extra planes, you have
x + y + z ≤15
Because Atlanta has 30 extra planes,
u + v + w ≤30
Finally, you want to minimize the cost, which is given by
C = 50,000x + 10,000y + 20,000z + 70,000u + 20,000v + 50,000w
Austin Brown/Getty Images

This gives you your LP problem:
Minimize
C = 50,000x + 10,000y + 20,000z + 70,000u + 20,000v + 50,000w
subject to

≥20
z
+ w ≥10
x + y + z
≤15
u + v + w ≤30
x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0, u ≥0, v ≥0, w ≥0
Because you have six unknowns, you know that you will have to use the simplex
method, so you start converting into the proper form. You change the minimization prob-
lem into the problem of maximizing P = −C. At the same time, you notice that it would
actually be enough to maximize
P = −5x −y −2z −7u −2v −5w
(this will keep the numbers small).You subtract the surplus variables p, q, and r from the
left-hand sides of the ﬁrst three inequalities, and you add the slack variables s and t to the
last two. Then it’s time to go to work. Remembering all the rules for pivoting, and using
a computer to help with the calculations, you get the following sequence of tableaux:

Now you see what to do: You should ﬂy 5 planes from Chicago to LA, none from
Chicago to NY, and 10 from Chicago to Boston. You should ﬂy 5 planes from Atlanta to
LA, 20 from Atlanta to NY, and none from Atlanta to Boston. The total cost will be
$1,200,000 to get the airline back on schedule.
Exercises
1.Your boss calls you on the carpet for not ﬂying any planes from Chicago to New York,
which is the cheapest run. Come up with a convincing reason for having made that
choice. Your job may be on the line.
2.Your boss insists that you ﬂy at least 5 planes from Chicago to New York. What is your
best option now?
3. If LA needed 15 planes rather than 10, what would be your best option?
4. If NY needed 25 planes rather than 20, what would be your best option?
5. If Boston needed 15 planes rather than 10, what would be your best option?
6. If there were only 10 planes in Chicago, what would be your best option?

side of a graph, but you need to tell the calculator which
side to shade. For instance, to obtain the solution set of
2x + 3y ≤6 shown in Figure 4:
1. Solve the corresponding equation 2x + 3y = 6 for y and
use the following input:
2. The icon to the left of “Y1” tells the calculator to shade
above the line. You can cycle through the various shad-
ing options by positioning the cursor to the left of Y1and
pressing
until you see the one you want. Here’s
what the graph will look like:

We use the PIVOT program for the TI-83/84 to help with
the simplex method. This program is available at
Chapter 4 →Tools
Because the calculator handles decimals as easily as inte-
gers, there is no need to avoid them, except perhaps to save
limited screen space. If we don’t need to avoid decimals, we
can use the traditional Gauss-Jordan method (see the dis-
cussion at the end of Section 2.2):After selecting your pivot,
and prior to clearing the pivot column, divide the pivot row
by the value of the pivot, thereby turning the pivot into a 1.
The main drawback to using the TI-83/84 is that we
can’t label the rows and columns. We can mentally label
them as we go, but we can do without them entirely if we
wish. We begin by entering the initial tableau as the matrix
[A]. (Another drawback to using the TI-83/84 is that it can’t
show the whole tableau at once. Here and below we show
tableaux across several screens. Use the TI-83/84’s arrow
keys to scroll a matrix left and right so you can see all of it.)
The following is the sequence of tableaux we get while
using the simplex method with the help of the PIVOT
program.

Excel is not a particularly good tool for graphing linear inequalities because it cannot easily shade one side of a line. One
solution is to use the “error bar” feature to indicate which side of the line should be shaded. For example, here is how we
might graph the inequality 2x + 3y ≤6.
1. Create a scatter graph using two points to construct a line segment (as in Chapter 1). (Notice that we had to solve the
equation 2x + 3y = 6 for y.)
2. Double-click on the line-segment, and use the “X-Error Bars” feature to obtain a diagram similar to the one on the left
below, where the error bars indicate the direction of shading.
There are no negative numbers in the bottom row, so we’re
ﬁnished. How do we read off the optimal solutions if we
don’t have labels, though? Look at the columns containing
one 1 and three 0s. They are the x column, the y column, the
s column, and the p column. Think of the 1 that appears in
each of these columns as a pivot whose column has been
cleared. If we had labels, the row containing a pivot would
have the same label as the column containing that pivot. We
can now read off the solution as follows:
x column: The pivot is in the ﬁrst row, so row 1 would
have been labeled with x. We look at the rightmost col-
umn to read off the value x = 300.
y column: The pivot is in row 3, so we look at the
rightmost column to read off the value y = 1000.
s column: The pivot is in row 2, so we look at the
rightmost column to read off the value s = 300.
p column: The pivot is in row 3, so we look at the
rightmost column to read off the value p = 10,000.
Thus, the maximum value of p is 10,000¢ = $100, which
occurs when x = 300 and y = 1000. The values of the
slack variables are s = 300 and t = u = 0. (Look at the t
and u columns to see that they must be inactive.)

Introduction
A knowledge of the mathematics of investments and loans is important not only for
business majors but also for everyone who deals with money, which is all of us. This
chapter is largely about interest: interest paid by an investment, interest paid on a loan,
and variations on these.
We focus on three forms of investment: investments that pay simple interest, invest-
ments in which interest is compounded, and annuities. An investment that pays simple in-
terest periodically gives interest directly to the investor, perhaps in the form of a monthly
check. If instead, the interest is reinvested, the interest is compounded, and the value of
the account grows as the interest is added. An annuity is an investment earning compound
interest into which periodic payments are made or from which periodic withdrawals are
made; in the case of periodic payments, such an investment is more commonly called a
sinking fund. From the point of view of the lender, a loan is a kind of annuity.
We also look at bonds, the primary ﬁnancial instrument used by companies and
governments to raise money. Although bonds nominally pay simple interest, determin-
ing their worth, particularly in the secondary market, requires an annuity calculation.

The Mathematics of Finance
5.1 Simple Interest
You deposit $1000, called the principal or present value, into a savings account. The
bank pays you 5% interest, in the form of a check, each year. How much interest will
you earn each year? Because the bank pays you 5% interest each year, your annual
(or yearly) interest will be 5% of $1000, or 0.05 × 1000 = $50.
Generalizing this calculation, call the present value PV and the interest rate
(expressed as a decimal) r. Then INT, the annual interest paid to you, is given by
INT = PVr
If the investment is made for a period of t years, then the total interest accumulated is
t times this amount, which gives us the following:
quick Example
Simple Interest
The simple interest on an investment (or loan) of PV dollars at an annual interest rate
of r for a period of t years is
INT = PVrt
The simple interest over a period of 4 years on a $5000 investment earning 8% per
year is
INT = PVrt
= (5000)(0.08)(4) = $1600
Note on Multiletter Variables
Multiletter variables like PV and INT are traditional in ﬁnance textbooks, calculators
(like the TI-83/84), and spreadsheets (like Excel). Just watch out for expressions like
PVr, which is the product of two things, PV and r, not three.

Given your $1000 investment at 5% simple interest, how much money will you
have after 2 years? To ﬁnd the answer, we need to add the accumulated interest to the
principal to get the future value (FV ) of your deposit.
FV = PV + INT = $1000 + (1000)(0.05)(2) = $1100
In general, we can compute the future value as follows:
FV = PV + INT = PV + PVrt = PV(1 + rt)
5.1 Simple Interest
343
quick Examples
Future Value for Simple Interest
The future value of an investment of PV dollars at an annual simple interest rate 
of r for a period of t years is
FV = PV(1 + rt)
1. The value, at the end of 4 years, of a $5000 investment earning 8% simple interest per
year is
FV = PV(1 + rt)
= 5000[1 + (0.08)(4)] = $6600
2. Writing the future value in Quick Example 1 as a function of time, we get
FV = 5000(1 + 0.08t)
= 5000 + 400t
which is a linear function of time t. The intercept is PV = $5000, and the slope is the
annual interest, $400 per year.
In general, Simple interest growth is a linear function of time, with intercept given by
the present value and slope given by annual interest.

Example 1 Savings Accounts
In August 2005, the Amex Bank of Canada was paying 2.40% interest on savings
accounts.* If the interest is paid as simple interest, ﬁnd the future value of a $2000 de-
posit in 6 years. What is the total interest paid over the period?
Solution We use the future value formula:
FV = PV(1 + rt)
= 2000[1 + (0.024)(6)] = 2000[1.144] = $2288

One of the primary ways companies and governments raise money is by selling
bonds. At its most straightforward, a corporate bond promises to pay simple interest,
usually twice a year, for a length of time until it matures, at which point it returns the
original investment to the investor (U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds are similar). Things
get more complicated when the selling price is negotiable, as we will see in the follow-
ing sections.
344
Chapter 5
The Mathematics of Finance
+Before we go on... In the preceding example, we could look at the future value as a
function of time:
FV = 2000(1 + 0.024t) = 2000 + 48t
Thus, the future value is growing linearly at a rate of $48 per year. ■
Example 2 Bridge Loans
When “trading up,” homeowners sometimes have to buy a new house before they sell
their old house. One way to cover the costs of the new house until they get the proceeds
from selling the old house is to take out a short-term bridge loan. Suppose a bank
charges 12% simple annual interest on such a loan. How much will be owed at the mat-
uration (the end) of a 90-day bridge loan of $90,000?
Solution We use the future value formula
FV = PV(1 + rt)
with t = 90/365, the fraction of a year represented by 90 days:
FV = 90,000[1 + (0.12)(90/365)]
= $92,663.01
(We will always round our answers to the nearest cent after calculation. Be careful not
to round intermediate results.)
+Before we go on... Many banks use 360 days for this calculation rather than 365, which
makes a “year” for the purposes of the loan slightly shorter than a calendar year. The
effect is to increase the amount owed:
FV = 90,000[1 + (0.12)(90/360)] = $92,700 ■
Example 3 Corporate Bonds
The Megabucks Corporation is issuing 10-year bonds paying an annual rate of 6.5%. If
you buy $10,000 worth of bonds, how much interest will you earn every 6 months, and
how much interest will you earn over the life of the bonds?
The total interest paid is given by the simple interest formula.
INT = PVrt
= (2000)(0.024)(6) = $288
Note To ﬁnd the interest paid, we could also have computed 
INT = FV −PV = 2288 −2000 = $288 ■

5.1 Simple Interest
345
We often want to turn an interest calculation around: Rather than starting with the
present value and ﬁnding the future value, there are times when we know the future
value and need to determine the present value. Solving the future value formula for PV
gives us the following.
quick Example
Present Value for Simple Interest
The present value of an investment at an annual simple interest rate of r for a period of
t years, with future value FV, is
PV =
FV
1 + rt
If an investment earns 5% simple interest and will be worth $1000 in 4 years, then its
present value (its initial value) is
PV =
FV
1 + rt
=
1000
1 + (0.05)(4) = $833.33
Here is a typical example. U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term investments
(up to 1 year) that pay you a set amount after a period of time.
Solution Using the simple interest formula, every 6 months you will receive
INT = PVrt
= (10,000)(0.065)
1
2

= $325
Over the 10-year life of the bonds, you will earn
INT = PVrt
= (10,000)(0.065)(10) = $6500
in interest. So, at the end of 10 years, when your original investment is returned to you,
your $10,000 will have turned into $16,500.
Example 4 Treasury Bills
A U.S. Treasury bill paying $10,000 after 6 months earns 3.67% simple annual interest.*
How much would it cost to buy?
Solution The future value of the T-bill is $10,000; the price we pay is its present value.
We know that
FV = $10,000
r = 0.0367
* Rate on August 12, 2005. SOURCE: Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15: Selected Interest Rates, dated
August 15, 2005, obtained from the White House’s Economics Statistics Brieﬁng Room, www.whitehouse.gov/
fsbr/esbr.html. By the way, because interest rates are often reported to 0.01%, you will sometimes see the term
basis point, which means one one-hundredth of a percent. Thus, for example, 25 basis points is the same as
0.25%, or 0.0025.

346
Chapter 5
The Mathematics of Finance
+Before we go on... The simplest way to ﬁnd the interest earned on the T-bill is by
subtraction:
INT = FV −PV = 10,000 −9819.81 = $180.19 ■
Example 5 Treasury Bills
A T-bill paying $10,000 after 6 months sells at a discount rate of 3.6%.* What does it
cost? What is the annual yield; that is, what simple annual interest rate does it pay?
Solution To say that a 1-year T-bill sells at a discount rate of 3.6% is to say that its
selling price is 3.6% lower than its maturity value of $10,000. The discount rates for
T-bills of other lengths are adjusted to give annual ﬁgures. Thus, the selling price for this
6-month T-bill will be 3.6/2 = 1.8% below its maturity value. This makes the selling
price, or present value,
PV = 10,000 −(10,000)(0.036/2)
= 10,000(1 −0.018) = $9820
Maturity value – Discount
To ﬁnd the annual interest rate, notice that
FV = $10,000
PV = $9820
and
t = 0.5
and we wish to ﬁnd r. Substituting in the future value formula, we get
FV = PV(1 + rt)
10,000 = 9820(1 + 0.5r)
so
1 + 0.5r = 10,000/9820
and
r = (10,000/9820 −1)/0.5 ≈0.0367
Thus, the bond is paying 3.67% simple annual interest.
* Ibid.
and
t = 0.5
Substituting into the present value formula, we have
PV =
10,000
1 + (0.0367)(0.5) = 9819.81
so we will pay $9819.81 for the T-bill.

5.1 Simple Interest
347
+Before we go on... The T-bill in Example 5 is the same one as in Example 4 (with a bit
of rounding). The interest rate and the discount rate are two different ways of telling
what the investment pays. One of the Communication and Reasoning Exercises asks you
to ﬁnd a formula for the interest rate in terms of the discount rate. ■
Fees on loans can also be thought of as a form of interest.
Example 6 Tax Refunds
You are expecting a tax refund of $800. Because it may take up to 6 weeks to get the re-
fund, your tax preparation ﬁrm offers, for a fee of $40, to give you an “interest-free” loan
of $800 to be paid back with the refund check. If we think of the fee as interest, what
simple annual interest rate is the ﬁrm charging?
Solution If we view the $40 as interest, then the future value of the loan (the value of
the loan to the ﬁrm, or the total you will pay the ﬁrm) is $840. Thus, we have
FV = 840
PV = 800
t = 6/52
Using 52 weeks in a year
and we wish to ﬁnd r. Substituting, we get
FV = PV(1 + rt)
840 = 800(1 + 6r/52) = 800 + 4800r
52
so
4800r
52
= 840 −800 = 40
r = 40 × 52
4800
≈0.43
In other words, the ﬁrm is charging you 43% annual interest! Save your money and wait
6 weeks for your refund.

5.2 Compound Interest
You deposit $1000 into a savings account. The bank pays you 5% interest, which it de-
posits into your account, or reinvests, at the end of each year. At the end of 5 years, how
much money will you have accumulated? Let us compute the amount you have at the
end of each year. At the end of the ﬁrst year, the bank will pay you simple interest of 5%
on your $1000, which gives you
PV(1 + rt) = 1000(1 + 0.05)
= $1050
At the end of the second year, the bank will pay you another 5% interest, but this
time computed on the total in your account, which is $1050. Thus, you will have a
total of
1050(1 + 0.05) = $1102.50
If you were being paid simple interest on your original $1000, you would have only
$1100 at the end of the second year. The extra $2.50 is the interest earned on the $50 in-
terest added to your account at the end of the ﬁrst year. Having interest earn interest is
called compounding the interest. We could continue like this until the end of the ﬁfth
year, but notice what we are doing: Each year we are multiplying by 1 + 0.05. So, at the
end of 5 years, you will have
1000(1 + 0.05)5 ≈$1276.28
It is interesting to compare this to the amount you would have if the bank paid you sim-
ple interest:
1000(1 + 0.05 × 5) = $1250.00
The extra $26.28 is again the effect of compounding the interest.
Banks often pay interest more often than once a year. Paying interest quarterly (four
times per year) or monthly is common. If your bank pays interest monthly, how much
will your $1000 deposit be worth after 5 years? The bank will not pay you 5% interest
every month, but will give you 1/12 of that,5 or 5/12% interest each month. Thus, instead
of multiplying by 1 + 0.05 every year, we should multiply by 1 + 0.05/12 each month.
Because there are 5 × 12 = 60 months in 5 years, the total amount you will have at the
end of 5 years is
1000

1 + 0.05
12
60
≈$1283.36
Compare this to the $1276.28 you would get if the bank paid the interest every year. You
earn an extra $7.08 if the interest is paid monthly because interest gets into your account
and starts earning interest earlier. The amount of time between interest payments is
called the compounding period.
5 This is approximate. They will actually give you 31/365 of the 5% at the end of January and so on, but it’s
simpler and reasonably accurate to call it 1/12.

terest reinvested every month, we set PV = 10,000, r = 0.06, m = 12, and t = 5.Thus,

Present Value for Compound Interest
The present value of an investment earning interest at an annual rate of r compounded
m times per year for a period of t years, with future value FV, is
PV =
FV

1 + r
m
mt
or
PV =
FV
(1 + i)n = FV(1 + i)−n
where i = r/m is the interest paid each compounding period and n = mt is the total
number of compounding periods.
To ﬁnd the amount we need to invest in an investment earning 12% per year, com-
pounded annually, so that we will have $1 million in 20 years, use FV = $1,000,000,
r = 0.12, m = 1, and t = 20:
PV =
FV

1 + r
m
mt =
1,000,000
(1 + 0.12)20 ≈$103,666.77
Put another way, $1,000,000 20 years from now is worth only $103,666.77 to us now, if
we have a 12% investment available.
Example 1 illustrates the concept of the time value of money: A given amount of
money received now will usually be worth a different amount to us than the same
amount received some time in the future. In the example above, we can say that $2000
received now is worth the same as $2308.77 received six years from now, because if we
receive $2000 now, we can turn it into $2308.77 by the end of six years.
We often want to know, for some amount of money in the future, what is the equiv-
alent value at present. As we did for simple interest, we can solve the future value for-
mula for the present value and obtain the following formula.

In the preceding section, we mentioned that a bond pays interest until it reaches ma-
turity, at which point it pays you back an amount called its maturity value or par value.
The two parts, the interest and the maturity value, can be separated and sold and traded
by themselves. A zero coupon bond is a form of corporate bond that pays no interest
during its life but, like U.S. Treasury bills, promises to pay you the maturity value when
it reaches maturity. Zero coupon bonds are often created by removing or stripping the
interest coupons from an ordinary bond, so are also known as strips. Zero coupon bonds
sell for less than their maturity value, and the return on your investment is the difference
between what the investor pays and the maturity value. Although no interest is actually
paid, we measure the return on investment by thinking of the interest rate that would
make the selling price (the present value) grow to become the maturity value (the future
value).6
5.2 Compound Interest

Example 2 Zero Coupon Bonds
Megabucks Corporation is issuing 10-year zero coupon bonds. How much would you
pay for bonds with a maturity value of $10,000 if you wish to get a return of 6.5% com-
pounded annually?*
Solution As we said earlier, we think of a zero coupon bond as if it were an account
earning (compound) interest. We are asked to calculate the amount you will pay for the
bond—the present value PV. We have
FV = $10,000
r = 0.065
t = 10
m = 1
We can now use the present value formula:
PV =
FV

1 + r

PV =

1 + 0.065
1
10×1 ≈$5327.26
Thus, you should pay $5327.26 to get a return of 6.5% annually.
* The return investors look for depends on a number of factors, including risk (the chance that the company will
go bankrupt and you will lose your investment); the higher the risk, the higher the return. U.S. Treasuries are
considered risk free because the federal government has never defaulted on its debts. On the other hand,
so-called junk bonds are high-risk investments (below investment grade) and have correspondingly high yields.
using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter for a 
discussion of using a TI-83/84

6 The IRS refers to this kind of interest as original issue discount (OID) and taxes it as if it were interest
actually paid to you each year.
+Before we go on... Particularly in ﬁnancial applications, you will hear the word
“discounted” in place of “compounded” when discussing present value. Thus, the result
of Example 2 might be phrased, “The present value of $10,000 to be received 10 years
from now, with an interest rate of 6.5% discounted annually, is $5,327.26.” ■

There are some other interesting calculations related to compound interest, besides
present and future values.
Time value of money calculations are often done to take into account inﬂation,
which behaves like compound interest. Suppose, for example, that inﬂation is running at
5% per year. Then prices will increase by 5% each year, so if PV represents the price
now, the price one year from now will be 5% higher, or PV(1 + 0.05). The price a year
from then will be 5% higher still, or PV(1 + 0.05)2. Thus, the effects of inﬂation are
compounded just as reinvested interest is.
354
Chapter 5
The Mathematics of Finance
Example 3 Inflation
Inﬂation in East Avalon is 5% per year. TruVision television sets cost $200 today. How
much will a comparable set cost 2 years from now?
Solution To ﬁnd the price of a television set 2 years from now, we compute the future
value of $200 at an inﬂation rate of 5% compounded yearly:
FV = 200(1 + 0.05)2 = $220.50
Example 4 Constant Dollars
Inﬂation in North Avalon is 6% per year. Which is really more expensive, a car costing
$20,000 today or one costing $22,000 in 3 years?
Solution We cannot compare the two costs directly because inﬂation makes $1 today
worth more (it buys more) than a dollar three years from now. We need the two prices
expressed in comparable terms, so we convert to constant dollars. We take the car cost-
ing $22,000 three years from now and ask what it would cost in today’s dollars. In other
words, we convert the future value of $22,000 to its present value:
PV = FV(1 + i)−n
= 22,000(1 + 0.06)−3
≈$18,471.62
Thus, the car costing $22,000 in 3 years actually costs less than the one costing
$20,000 now.
+Before we go on... In the presence of inﬂation, the only way to compare prices at dif-
ferent times is to convert all prices to constant dollars. We pick some ﬁxed time and
compute future or present values as appropriate to determine what things would have
cost at that time. ■
Example 5 Effective Interest Rate
You have just won $1 million in the lottery and are deciding what to do with it during the
next year before you move to the South Paciﬁc. Bank Ten offers 10% interest, com-
pounded annually, while Bank Nine offers 9.8% compounded monthly. In which should
you deposit your money?

5.2 Compound Interest
355
Another way of looking at the calculation in Example 5 is that Bank Nine gave you
a total of 10.25% interest on your investment over the year. We call 10.25% the effective
interest rate of the investment (also referred to as the annual percentage yield, or APY
in the banking industry); the stated 9.8% is called the nominal interest rate. In general,
to best compare two different investments, it is wisest to compare their effective—rather
than nominal—interest rates.
Notice that we got 10.25% by computing

1 + 0.098
12
12
= 1.1025
and then subtracting 1 to get 0.1025, or 10.25%. Generalizing, we get the following
formula.
quick Example
Effective Interest Rate
The effective interest rate reff of an investment paying a nominal interest rate of rnom
compounded m times per year is
reff =

1 + rnom
m
m
−1
To compare rates of investments with different compounding periods, always compare
the effective interest rates rather than the nominal rates.
To calculate the effective interest rate of an investment that pays 8% per year, with in-
terest reinvested monthly, set rnom = 0.08 and m = 12, to obtain
reff =

1 + 0.08
12
12
−1 ≈0.0830,
or
8.30%
Solution Let’s calculate the future value of your $1 million after one year in each of
the banks:
Bank Ten:
FV = 1(1 + 0.10)1 = $1.1 million
Bank Nine:
FV = 1

1 + 0.098
12
12
= $1.1025 million
Bank Nine turns out to be better: It will pay you a total of $102,500 in interest over the
year, whereas Bank Ten will pay only $100,000 in interest.
Example 6 How Long to Invest
You have $5000 to invest at 6% interest compounded monthly. How long will it take for
your investment to grow to $6000?
Solution If we use the future value formula, we already have the values
FV = 6000
PV = 5000
r = 0.06
m = 12

FAQs
Recognizing When to Use Compound Interest and the Meaning 
of Present Value
Q: How do I distinguish a problem that calls for compound interest from one that calls for
simple interest?
A: Study the scenario to ascertain whether the interest is being withdrawn as it is earned or
reinvested (deposited back into the account). If the interest is being withdrawn, the problem is
calling for simple interest because the interest is not itself earning interest. If it is being rein-
vested, the problem is calling for compound interest. ■
Q: How do I distinguish present value from future value in a problem?
A: The present value always refers to the value of an investment before any interest is in-
cluded (or, in the case of a depreciating investment, before any depreciation takes place). As
an example, the future value of a bond is its maturity value. The value of $1 today in constant
1990 dollars is its present value (even though 1990 is in the past). ■

27. Investments When I was considering what to do with my
$10,000 Lottery winnings, my broker suggested I invest half
of it in gold, the value of which was growing by 10% per year,
and the other half in CDs, which were yielding 5% per year,
compounded every 6 months. Assuming that these rates are
sustained, how much will my investment be worth in 10 years?
28. Investments When I was considering what to do with the

Annuities, Loans, and Bonds
A typical deﬁned-contribution pension fund works as follows:13 Every month while you
work, you and your employer deposit a certain amount of money in an account. This
money earns (compound) interest from the time it is deposited. When you retire, the ac-
count continues to earn interest, but you may then start withdrawing money at a rate
calculated to reduce the account to zero after some number of years. This account is an
example of an annuity, an account earning interest into which you make periodic
deposits or from which you make periodic withdrawals. In common usage, the term
“annuity” is used for an account from which you make withdrawals. There are various
terms used for accounts into which you make payments, based on their purpose. Exam-
ples include savings account,pension fund, or sinking fund.A sinking fund is generally
used by businesses or governments to accumulate money to pay off an anticipated debt,
but we’ll use the term to refer to any account into which you make periodic payments.
Sinking Funds
Suppose you make a payment of $100 at the end of every month into an account earn-
ing 3.6% interest per year, compounded monthly. This means that your investment is
earning 3.6%/12 = 0.3% per month. We write i = 0.036/12 = 0.003. What will be the
value of the investment at the end of two years (24 months)?
Think of the deposits separately. Each earns interest from the time it is deposited,
and the total accumulated after two years is the sum of these deposits and the interest
they earn. In other words, the accumulated value is the sum of the future values of the
deposits, taking into account how long each deposit sits in the account. Figure 1 shows
a timeline with the deposits and the contribution of each to the ﬁnal value.
13 Deﬁned-contribution pensions are increasingly common, replacing the deﬁned-beneﬁt pensions that were
once the norm. In a deﬁned-beneﬁt pension, the size of your pension is guaranteed; it is typically a percentage
of your ﬁnal working salary. In a deﬁned-contribution plan the size of your pension depends on how well your
investments do.

For example, the very last deposit (at the end of month 24) has no time to earn interest,
so it contributes only $100. The very ﬁrst deposit, which earns interest for 23 months,
by the future value formula for compound interest contributes $100(1 + 0.003)23to the
total. Adding together all of the future values gives us the total future value:
FV = 100 + 100(1 + 0.003) + 100(1 + 0.003)2 + · · · + 100(1 + 0.003)23
= 100[1 + (1 + 0.003) + (1 + 0.003)2 + · · · + (1 + 0.003)23]
Fortunately, this sort of sum is well-known (to mathematicians, anyway14) and there is a
convenient formula for its value:15
1 + x + x2 + · · · + xn−1 = xn−1
x −1
In our case, with x = 1 + 0.003, this formula allows us to calculate the future value:
FV = 100(1 + 0.003)24 −1
(1 + 0.003) −1 = 100(1.003)24 −1
0.003
≈$2484.65
It is now easy to generalize this calculation.

Future Value of a Sinking Fund
A sinking fund is an account earning compound interest into which you make periodic de-
posits. Suppose that the account has an annual rate of r compounded m times per year, so
that i = r/m is the interest rate per compounding period. If you make a payment of PMT
at the end of each period, then the future value after t years, or n = mt periods, will be
FV = PMT(1 + i)n −1
i
quick Example
At the end of each month you deposit $50 into an account earning 2% annual interest
compounded monthly. To ﬁnd the future value after ﬁve years, we use i = 0.02/12 and
n = 12 × 5 = 60 compounding periods, so
FV = 50(1 + 0.02/12)60 −1
0.02/12
= $3152.37
14 It is called a geometric series.
15 The quickest way to convince yourself that this formula is correct is to multiply out (x −1)(1 + x +
x2 + · · · + xn−1) and see that you get xn −1. You should also try substituting some numbers. For example,
1 + 3 + 32 = 13 = (33 −1)/(3 −1).

Example 1 Retirement Account
Your retirement account has $5000 in it and earns 5% interest per year compounded
monthly. Every month for the next 10 years you will deposit $100 into the account. How
much money will there be in the account at the end of those 10 years?
Solution This is a sinking fund with PMT = $100, r = 0.05, m = 12, so
i = 0.05/12, and n = 12 × 10 = 120. Ignoring for the moment the $5000 already
in the account, your payments have the following future value:
FV = PMT(1 + i)n −1
i
= 100

1 + 0.05
12
120 −1
0.05
12
≈$15,528.23
What about the $5000 that was already in the account? That sits there and earns interest,
so we need to ﬁnd its future value as well, using the compound interest formula:
FV = PV(1 + i)n
= 5000(1 + 0.05/12)120
= $8235.05
Hence, the total amount in the account at the end of 10 years will be
$15,528.23 + 8235.05 = $23,763.28
using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter for a dis-
cussion of using a TI-83/84 or
Excel to compute future values
of sinking funds.
Payment Formula for a Sinking Fund
Suppose that an account has an annual rate of r compounded m times per year, so that
i = r/m is the interest rate per compounding period. If you want to accumulate a total of
FV in the account after t years, or n = mt periods, by making payments of PMT at the
end of each period, then each payment must be
PMT = FV
i
(1 + i)n −1
Sometimes we know what we want the future value to be and need to determine the
payments necessary to achieve that goal. We can simply solve the future value formula
for the payment.
Example 2 Education Fund
Tony and Maria have just had a son, José Phillipe. They establish an account to accu-
mulate money for his college education, in which they would like to have $100,000 after
17 years. If the account pays 4% interest per year compounded quarterly, and they make
deposits at the end of every quarter, how large must each deposit be for them to reach
their goal?

Solution This is a sinking fund with FV = $100,000, m = 4, n = 4 × 17 = 68, and
r = 0.04, so i = 0.04/4 = 0.01. From the payment formula, we get
PMT = 100,000
0.01
(1 + 0.01)68 −1 ≈$1033.89
So, Tony and Maria must deposit $1033.89 every quarter in order to meet their goal.

Annuities
Suppose we deposit an amount PV now in an account earning 3.6% interest per year,
compounded monthly. Starting one month from now, the bank will send us monthly pay-
ments of $100. What must PV be so that the account will be drawn down to $0 in exactly
2 years?
As before, we write i = r/m = 0.036/12 = 0.003, and we have PMT = 100. The
ﬁrst payment of $100 will be made one month from now, so its present value is
PMT
(1 + i)n =
100
1 + 0.003 = 100(1 + 0.003)−1 ≈$99.70
In other words, that much of the original PV goes towards funding the ﬁrst payment. The
second payment, two months from now, has a present value of
PMT
(1 + i)n =
100
(1 + 0.003)2 = 100(1 + 0.003)−2 ≈$99.40
That much of the original PV funds the second payment. This continues for two years,
at which point we receive the last payment, which has a present value of
PMT
(1 + i)n =
100
(1 + 0.003)24 = 100(1 + 0.003)−24 ≈$93.06
and that exhausts the account. Figure 2 shows a timeline with the payments and the
present value of each.

PV = 100(1 + 0.003)−1 + 100(1 + 0.003)−2 + · · · + 100(1 + 0.003)−24
= 100[(1 + 0.003)−1 + (1 + 0.003)−2 + · · · + (1 + 0.003)−24]

We can again ﬁnd a simpler formula for this sum:
x−1 + x−2 + · · · + x−n = 1
xn (xn−1 + xn−2 + · · · + 1)
= 1
xn · xn −1
x −1 = 1 −x−n
x −1
So, in our case,
PV = 1001 −(1 + 0.003)−24
(1 + 0.003) −1
or
PV = 1001 −(1.003)−24
0.003
≈$2312.29
If we deposit $2312.29 initially and the bank sends us $100 per month for two years, our
account will be exhausted at the end of that time.
Generalizing, we get the following formula:

Chapter 5
The Mathematics of Finance
Present Value of an Annuity
An annuity is an account earning compound interest from which periodic withdrawals
are made. Suppose that the account has an annual rate of r compounded m times per year,
so that i = r/m is the interest rate per compounding period. Suppose also that the ac-
count starts with a balance of PV. If you receive a payment of PMT at the end of each
compounding period, and the account is down to $0 after t years, or n = mt periods, then
PV = PMT1 −(1 + i)−n
i
quick Example
At the end of each month you want to withdraw $50 from an account earning 2% annual
interest compounded monthly. If you want the account to last for ﬁve years (60 com-
pounding periods), it must have the following amount to begin with:
PV = 501 −(1 + 0.02/12)−60
0.02/12
= $2852.62
Note If you make your withdrawals at the end of each compounding period, as we’ve
discussed so far, you have an ordinary annuity. If, instead, you make withdrawals at
the beginning of each compounding period, you have an annuity due. Because each
payment occurs one period earlier, there is one less period in which to earn interest,
hence the present value must be larger by a factor of (1 + i) to fund each payment. So,
the present value formula for an annuity due is
PV = PMT(1 + i) 1 −(1 + i)−n
i
In this book, we will concentrate on ordinary annuities. ■
Example 3 Trust Fund
You wish to establish a trust fund from which your niece can withdraw $2000 every six
months for 15 years, at the end of which time she will receive the remaining money in

the trust, which you would like to be $10,000. The trust will be invested at 7% per year
compounded every six months. How large should the trust be?
Solution We view this account as having two parts, one funding the semiannual pay-
ments and the other funding the $10,000 lump sum at the end. The amount of money
necessary to fund the semiannual payments is the present value of an annuity, with
PMT = 2000, r = 0.07 and m = 2, so i = 0.07/2 = 0.035, and n = 2 × 15 = 30.
Substituting gives
PV = 20001 −(1 + 0.035)−30
0.035
= $36,784.09
To fund the lump sum of $10,000 after 15 years, we need the present value of $10,000
under compound interest:
PV = 10,000(1 + 0.035)−30
= $3562.78
Thus the trust should start with $36,784.09 + 3562.78 = $40,346.87.

the end of the chapter for a dis-

Excel to compute the present
value of an annuity.
Sometimes we know how much money we begin with and for how long we want to
make withdrawals. We then want to determine the amount of money we can withdraw
each period. For this, we simply solve the present value formula for the payment.
Payment Formula for an Ordinary Annuity
Suppose that an account has an annual rate of r compounded m times per year, so that
i = r/m is the interest rate per compounding period. Suppose also that the account starts
with a balance of PV. If you want to receive a payment of PMT at the end of each com-
pounding period, and the account is down to $0 after t years, or n = mt periods, then
PMT = PV
i
1 −(1 + i)−n
Example 4 Education Fund
Tony and Maria (see Example 2), having accumulated $100,000 for José Phillipe’s college
education, would now like to make quarterly withdrawals over the next four years. How
much money can they withdraw each quarter in order to draw down the account to zero at
the end of the four years? (Recall that the account pays 4% interest compounded quarterly.)
Solution Now Tony and Maria’s account is acting as an annuity with a present value of
$100,000. So, PV = $100,000, r = 0.04 and m = 4, giving i = 0.04/4 = 0.01, and
n = 4 × 4 = 16. We use the payment formula to get
PMT = 100,000
0.01
1 −(1 + 0.01)−16 ≈$6794.46
So, they can withdraw $6794.46 each quarter for four years, at the end of which time
their account balance will be 0.

Installment Loans
In a typical installment loan, such as a car loan or a home mortgage, we borrow an
amount of money and then pay it back with interest by making ﬁxed payments (usually
every month) over some number of years. From the point of view of the lender, this is an
annuity. Thus, loan calculations are identical to annuity calculations.

Example 5 Saving for Retirement
Jane Q. Employee has just started her new job with Big Conglomerate, Inc., and is al-
ready looking forward to retirement. BCI offers her as a pension plan an annuity that
is guaranteed to earn 6% annual interest compounded monthly. She plans to work for
40 years before retiring and would then like to be able to draw an income of $7000 per
month for 20 years. How much do she and BCI together have to deposit per month into
the fund to accomplish this?
Solution Here we have the situation we described at the beginning of the section: a
sinking fund accumulating money to be used later as an annuity. We know the desired
payment out of the annuity, so we work backward. The ﬁrst thing we need to do is cal-
culate the present value of the annuity required to make the pension payments. We use
the annuity present value formula with PMT = 7000, i = r/m = 0.06/12 = 0.005 and
n = 12 × 20 = 240.
PV = PMT1 −(1 + i)−n
i
= 70001 −(1 + 0.005)−240
0.005
≈$977,065.40
This is the total that must be accumulated in the sinking fund during the 40 years she
plans to work. In other words, this is the future value, FV, of the sinking fund. (Thus, the
present value in the ﬁrst step of our calculation is the future value in the second step.) To
determine the payments necessary to accumulate this amount, we use the sinking fund
payment formula with FV = 977,065.40, i = 0.005, and n = 12 × 40 = 480.
PMT = FV
i
(1 + i)n −1
= 977,065.40
0.005
1.005480 −1
≈$490.62
So, if she and BCI collectively deposit $490.62 per month into her retirement fund, she
can retire with the income she desires.
Example 6 Home Mortgages
Marc and Mira are buying a house, and have taken out a 30-year, $90,000 mortgage at
8% interest per year. What will their monthly payments be?
Solution From the bank’s point of view, a mortgage is an annuity. In this case, the
present value is PV = $90,000, r = 0.08, m = 12, and n = 12 × 30 = 360. To ﬁnd the
payments, we use the payment formula:
PMT = 90,000
0.08/12
1 −(1 + 0.08/12)−360 ≈$660.39
Paul Seheult/Eye Ubiquitous/Corbis

The word “mortgage” comes from the French for “dead pledge.” The process of
paying off a loan is called amortizing the loan, meaning to kill the debt owed.
5.3 Annuities, Loans, and Bonds
367
Example 7 Amortization Schedule
Continuing Example 6: Mortgage interest is tax-deductible, so it is important to know
how much of a year’s mortgage payments represents interest. How much interest will
Marc and Mira pay in the ﬁrst year of their mortgage?
Solution Let us calculate how much of each month’s payment is interest and how
much goes to reducing the outstanding principal. At the end of the ﬁrst month Marc and
Mira must pay one month’s interest on $90,000, which is
$90,000 × 0.08
12 = $600
The remainder of their ﬁrst monthly payment, $660.39 −600 = $60.39 goes to reduc-
ing the principal. Thus, in the second month the outstanding principal is $90,000 −
60.39 = $89,939.61, and part of their second monthly payment will be for the interest
on this amount, which is
$89,939.61 × 0.08
12 = $599.60
The remaining $660.39 −$599.60 = $60.79 goes to further reduce the principal. If we
continue this calculation for the 12 months of the ﬁrst year, we get the beginning of the
mortgage’s amortization schedule.

tion schedule.
As we can see from the totals at the bottom of the columns, Marc and Mira will pay a
total of $7172.81 in interest in the ﬁrst year.

Bonds
Suppose that a corporation offers a 10-year bond paying 6.5% with payments every six
months. As we saw in Example 3 of Section 5.1, this means that if we pay $10,000 for
bonds with a maturity value of $10,000, we will receive 6.5/2 = 3.25% of $10,000, or
$325, every six months for 10 years, at the end of which time the corporation will give us
the original $10,000 back. But bonds are rarely sold at their maturity value. Rather, they
are auctioned off and sold at a price the bond market determines they are worth.
For example, suppose that bond traders are looking for an investment that has a rate
of return or yield of 7% rather than the stated 6.5% (sometimes called the coupon in-
terest rate to distinguish it from the rate of return). How much would they be willing to
pay for the bonds above with a maturity value of $10,000? Think of the bonds as an in-
vestment that will pay the owner $325 every six months for 10 years, at the end of which
time it will pay $10,000. We can treat the $325 payments as if they come from an annu-
ity and determine how much an investor would pay for such an annuity if it earned 7%
compounded semiannually. Separately, we determine the present value of an investment
worth $10,000 ten years from now, if it earned 7% compounded semiannually. For the
ﬁrst calculation, we use the annuity present value formula, with i = 0.07/2 and
n = 2 × 10 = 20.
PV = PMT1 −(1 + i)−n
i
= 3251 −(1 + 0.07/2)−20
0.07/2
= $4619.03
For the second calculation, we use the present value formula for compound interest:
PV = 10,000(1 + 0.07/2)−20
= $5025.66

5.3 Annuities, Loans, and Bonds

Example 8 Bonds
Suppose that bond traders are looking for only a 6% yield on their investment. How
much would they pay per $10,000 for the 10-year bonds above, which have a coupon in-
terest rate of 6.5% and pay interest every six months?
Solution We redo the calculation with r = 0.06. For the annuity calculation we 
now get
PV = 3251 −(1 + 0.06/2)−20
0.06/2
= $4835.18
For the compound interest calculation we get
PV = 10,000(1 + 0.06/2)−20 = $5536.76
Thus, traders would be willing to pay a total of $4835.18 + $5536.76 = $10,371.94 for
bonds with a maturity value of $10,000.
Before we go on...Notice how the selling price of the bonds behaves as the desired yield
changes. As desired yield goes up, the price of the bonds goes down, and as desired yield
goes down, the price of the bonds goes up. When the desired yield equals the coupon in-
terest rate, the selling price will equal the maturity value. Therefore, when the yield is
higher than the coupon interest rate, the price of the bond will be below its maturity
value, and when the yield is lower than the coupon interest rate, the price will be above
the maturity value.
As we’ve mentioned before, the desired yield depends on many factors, but it gener-
ally moves up and down with prevailing interest rates. And interest rates have historically
gone up and down cyclically. The effect on the value of bonds can be quite dramatic (see
Exercises 65 and 66 in the preceding section). Because bonds can be sold again once
bought, someone who buys bonds while interest rates are high and then resells them
when interest rates decline can make a healthy proﬁt. ■
Example 9 Rate of Return on a Bond
Suppose that a 5%, 20-year bond sells for $9800 per $10,000 maturity value. What rate
of return will investors get?
Solution Assuming the usual semiannual payments, we know the following about the
annuity calculation:
PMT = 0.05 × 10,000/2 = 250
n = 20 × 2 = 40
What we do not know is r or i, the annual or semiannual interest rate. So, we write
PV = 2501 −(1 + i)−40
i
+
using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter for a 
discussion of using a TI-83/84
or Excel to ﬁnd the yield using
built-in functions.
Thus, an investor looking for a 7% return will be willing to pay $4619.03 for the semi-
annual payments of $325 and $5025.66 for the $10,000 payment at the end of 10 years,
for a total of $4619.03 + 5025.66 = $9644.69 for the $10,000 bond.

For the compound interest calculation, we know FV = 10,000 and n = 40 again, so we
write
PV = 10,000(1 + i)−40
Adding these together should give the selling price of $9800:
2501 −(1 + i)−40
i
+ 10,000(1 + i)−40 = 9800
This equation cannot be solved for i directly. The best we can do by hand is a sort of trial
and error approach, substituting a few values for i in the left-hand side of the above
equation to get an estimate:

Because we want the value to be 9800, we see that the correct answer is somewhere be-
tween i = 0.02 and i = 0.03. Let us try the value midway between 0.02 and 0.03;
namely i = 0.025.
Now we know that the correct value of i is somewhere between 0.025 and 0.03, so we
choose for our next estimate of i the number midway between them: 0.0275. We could
continue in this fashion to obtain i as accurately as we like. In fact, i ≈0.02581, corre-
sponding to an annual rate of return of approximately 5.162%.
FAQs
Which Formula to Use
Q: We have retirement accounts, trust funds, loans, bonds, and so on. Some are sinking funds,
others are annuities. How do we distinguish among them, so we can tell which formula to use?
A: In general, remember that a sinking fund is an interest-bearing fund into which payments
are made, while an annuity is an interest-bearing fund from which money is withdrawn. Here is
a list of some of the accounts we have discussed in this section:
• Retirement Accounts A retirement account is a sinking fund while payments are being made
into the account (prior to retirement) and an annuity while a pension is being withdrawn
(after retirement).
• Education Funds These are similar to retirement accounts.
• Trust Funds A trust fund is an annuity if periodic withdrawals are made.
• Installment Loans We think of an installment loan as an investment a bank makes in the
lender. In this way, the lender’s payments can be viewed as the bank’s withdrawals, and so a
loan is an annuity.
• Bonds A bond pays regular fixed amounts until it matures, at which time it pays its maturity
value. We think of the bond as an annuity coupled with a compound interest investment fund-
ing the payment of the maturity value. We can then determine its present value based on the
current market interest rate.
From a mathematical point of view, sinking funds and annuities are really the same thing. See
the Communication and Reasoning Exercises for more about this. ■

the ﬁrst ﬁve years the interest rate is held at 5%, but for the
remaining 25 years it rises to 9.5%. The payments for the ﬁrst
ﬁve years are calculated as if the 5% rate were going to re-
main in effect for all 30 years, and then the payments for the
last 25 years are calculated to amortize the debt remaining at
the end of the ﬁfth year. What are your monthly payments for

year of operation, amounted to $150,000.
29. After December, 1999, revenues increased by a steady 20%
each year. Track OHaganBooks.com’s revenues for the subse-
quent 5 years, assuming that this rate of growth continued.
During which year did the revenue surpass $300,000?
30. Unfortunately, the picture for net income was not so bright:
The company lost $20,000 in the fourth quarter of 1999. How-
ever, the quarterly loss decreased at an annual rate of 15%.
How much did the company lose during the third quarter of
2001?
31. In order to ﬁnance anticipated expansion, you are considering
making a public offering of OHaganBooks.com shares at
$3.00 a share. You are not sure how many shares to offer, but
you would like the total value of the shares to reach a market
value of at least $500,000 six months after the initial offering.
Your ﬁnancial adviser, Sally McCormack, tells you that you
can expect the value of the stock to double in the ﬁrst day of
trading, and then you should expect an appreciation rate of
around 8% per month for the ﬁrst six months. How many
shares should you sell?
Unfortunately, the stock market takes a dive just as you are con-
cluding plans for your stock offering in Question 31, so you decide
to postpone the offering until the market shows renewed vigor. In
the meantime, there is an urgent need to ﬁnance the continuing
losses at OHaganBooks.com, so you decide to seek a $250,000
loan.

OHaganBooks.com has just introduced a retirement package for
the employees. Under the annuity plan operated by Sleepy Hollow
Retirement, Inc., the monthly contribution by the company on
behalf of each employee is $800. Each employee can then supple-
ment that amount through payroll deductions.
35. The current rate of return of Sleepy Hollow Inc.’s retirement
fund is 7.3%, and James Callahan, your site developer, plans to
retire in 10 years. He contributes $1000 per month to the plan
(in addition to the company contribution of $800). Currently,
there is $50,000 in his retirement annuity. How much (to the
nearest dollar) will it be worth when he retires?
36. How much of that retirement fund was from the company con-
tribution? (The company did not contribute toward the
$50,000 Callahan now has.)
37. Callahan actually wants to retire with $500,000. How much
should he contribute each month to the annuity?
38. On second thoughts, Callahan wants to be in a position to
draw at least $5000 per month for 30 years after his retire-
ment. He feels he can invest the proceeds of his retirement
annuity at 8.7% per year in perpetuity. Given the information
in part (a), how much will he need to contribute to the plan
starting now?
Actually, James Callahan is quite pleased with himself; one year
ago he purchased a $50,000 government bond paying 7.2% per
year (with interest paid every six months) and maturing in 10
years, and interest rates have come down since then.
39. The current interest rate on 10-year government bonds is 6.3%.
If he were to auction the bond at the current interest rate, how
much would he get?
40. If he holds on to the bond for six more months and the interest
rate drops to 6%, how much will the bond be worth then?
41.
Ex James suspects that interest rates will come down
further during the next six months. If he hopes to auction the
bond for $54,000 in six months’ time, what will the interest
rate need to be at that time?

CAS E STU DY:
Saving for College
Tuition costs at public and private four-year colleges and
universities increased at an average rate of about 5.8%
per year from 1991 through 2001. The 2001–2002 costs
for tuition, fees, room, and board were $9,008 for a pub-
lic in-state college and $23,578 for a private college.18
Mr. and Mrs. Wong have an appointment tomorrow
with you, their investment counselor, to discuss a plan
to save for their newborn child’s college education. You
have already recommended that they invest a ﬁxed
amount each month in mutual funds expected to yield
6% per year (with earnings reinvested each month) until their child begins college at age
18. They have indicated that they are not sure when they will start making the monthly
payments, however, and of course they don’t know which type of college or university
their child will attend.
You decide that you should create an Excel worksheet that will compute the monthly
payment PMT for various possibilities for the age of the child at the time the Wongs begin
making payments and the current cost of tuition at the college. The ﬁgures you have are
for 2001 and it is now 2006, so you update your ﬁgures using the future value formula for
compound interest, assuming that the 5.8% rate of increase continued.
9008(1 + 0.058)5 = $11,941
and
23,578(1 + 0.058)5 = $31,256
You begin to create your worksheet by entering various possible ages and the two tu-
ition ﬁgures you just computed.
Cindy Charles/PhotoEdit
Ultimately, you would like to compute in cells B3 through C13 the monthly payments
corresponding to the various possible combinations of age and tuition. You decide that it

Case Study
377
You realize that you need to do a two-stage calculation: First, you need to ﬁnd the
amount of money required to fund the tuition payments. Second, you will need to ﬁnd the
monthly payments that will lead to that amount of money.
The ﬁrst calculation is not a simple annuity because the amount the Wongs need to
withdraw for tuition will continue to rise over the course of the four years their child is in
college. You begin by computing the 8 semiannual tuition payments that will be required.
The ﬁrst occurs 18 years hence and pays for half a year, so will be half of the future value
of the current tuition, with the assumed annual inﬂation rate. The second will pay for the
second half of that year, so it will be identical. You can compute the future value using
the FV worksheet function or directly. The next 6 payments also occur in pairs. You leave
room above the tuition payments to compute the required accumulation.
Copying these formulas into column F gives you two columns of ﬁgures—the one in
column E being the tuition payments that will be required for a public college and the one
in column F being the payments that will be required for a private college.
would also be good to enter the rate of inﬂation of tuition costs and the assumed return on
the mutual fund in their own cells.

378
Chapter 5
The Mathematics of Finance
Now, enough money needs to be accumulated in the account to fund each of these pay-
ments. Because the account continues to earn interest, the amount required to fund each
payment should be discounted back to the beginning of the child’s college career. Thus,
for column E (public college), you want a formula to compute
E4 + E5(1 + i)−1 + E6(1 + i)−2 + · · · + E11(1 + i)−7
where i is the semiannual interest rate for the mutual fund. Fortunately, Excel has a work-
sheet function just for this purpose, called NPV (Net Present Value). It takes an interest rate
and a series of payments and computes the sum of the present values of those payments, as-
suming that the payments are made regularly at the end of each period. Because the ﬁrst
payment (in E4) will be made right away, you need to apply NPV to only E5 through E11
and add in E4. One more thing you need to do is determine the semiannual interest rate for
the mutual fund. This is similar to the effective rate calculation: Because the fund earns
(6%)/12 each month, over 6 months it will earn interest at a rate of

1 + 0.06

Thus, you enter the formula
=E4+NPV((1+$E$2/12)^6-1,E5:E11)
into cell E3 and copy it into F3 as well, getting the following result:

Case Study
379
You have now completed the calculation of the amount that needs to be accumulated
in the account to pay for college. What remains is to compute the monthly payment
needed to reach this goal, but this is a straightforward sinking fund calculation. You enter
the following formula in cell B3 and copy it to all the cells in the rectangle B3:C13:
Thus, for example, if Mr. and Mrs. Wong start saving for a private college next year,
when their child is one year old, they will need to invest $957.13 per month to save
enough money to pay fully for private college.

was paying 2.40% interest on savings accounts. If the inter-
est is compounded quarterly, ﬁnd the future value of a
$2000 deposit in 6 years. What is the total interest paid over
the period?
Solution with Technology We could calculate the future
value using the TI-83/84 by entering
2000(1+0.0240/4)^(4*6)
However, the TI-83/84 has this and other useful calculations
built into its TVM (Time Value of Money) Solver.
1. On the TI-83/84, press 2nd
and then choose
item 1:TVM Solver, from the menu. (On a TI-84 Plus,
press 
then choose item 1:Finance and then
choose item 1:TVM Solver.) This brings up the TVM
Solver window.
The second screen shows the values you should enter for
this example. The various variables are:
N
Number of compounding periods
I%
Annual interest rate, as percent, not decimal
PV
Negative of present value
PMT
Payment per period (0 in this section)
FV
Future value
P/Y
Payments per year
C/Y
Compounding periods per year
PMT:
Not used in this section
Several things to notice:
• I% is the annual interest rate, corresponding to r, not i, in
the compound interest formula.
APPS
FINANCE
• The present value, PV, is entered as a negative number. In
general, when using the TVM Solver, any amount of
money you give to someone else (such as the $2000 you
deposit in the bank) will be a negative number, whereas
any amount of money someone gives to you (such as the
future value of your deposit, which the bank will give
back to you) will be a positive number.
• PMT is not used in this example (it will be used in the next
section) and should be 0.
• FV is the future value, which we shall compute in a mo-
ment; it doesn’t matter what you enter now.
• P/Y and C/Y stand for payments per year and compound-
ing periods per year, respectively: They should both be set
to the number of compounding periods per year for com-
pound interest problems (setting P/Y automatically sets
C/Y to the same value).
• PMT: END or BEGIN is not used in this example and it
doesn’t matter which you select.

put the cursor on the FV line, then press

Example 6 You have $5000 to invest at 6% interest com-

to grow to $6000?
Solution with Technology
1. Enter the numbers shown on the left in the TVM Solver
window.
2. Put the cursor on the N line, and press 
.
Recall that I% is the annual interest rate, corresponding to r
in the formula, but N is the number of compounding peri-
ods, so number of months in this example. Thus, you will
need to invest your money for about 36.5 months, or just
over three years, before it grows to $6000.
Section 5.3
Example 1 Your retirement account has $5000 in it and
earns 5% interest per year compounded monthly. Every
month for the next 10 years, you will deposit $100 into the
account. How much money will there be in the account at
the end of those 10 years?
Solution with Technology We can use the TVM Solver in
the TI-83/84 to calculate future values like these:
1. Enter the values shown on the left.
2. With the cursor on the FV line, press 
to
ﬁnd the future value.
Note that the TVM Solver allows you to put the $5000 al-
ready in the account as the present value of the account.
3. Following the TI-83/84’s usual convention, set PV to the
negative of the present value because this is money you
paid into the account.
4. Likewise, set PMT to −100 because you are paying $100
each month.

Phillipe. They establish an account to accumulate money for
his college education. They would like to have $100,000 in
this account after 17 years. If the account pays 4% interest
per year compounded quarterly, and they make deposits at
the end of every quarter, how large must each deposit be for
them to reach their goal?
Solution with Technology
1. In the TVM Solver in the TI-83/84, enter the values
shown below.
2. Solve for PMT.
Why is PMT negative?
Example 3 You wish to establish a trust fund from which
your niece can withdraw $2000 every six months for 15
years, at which time she will receive the remaining money
in the trust, which you would like to be $10,000. The trust
will be invested at 7% per year compounded every six
months. How large should the trust be?
Solution with Technology
1. In the TVM Solver in the TI-83/84, enter the values
shown below.
2. Solve for PV.
The payment and future value are positive because you (or
your niece) will be receiving these amounts from the
investment.

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
Note We have assumed that your niece receives the
withdrawals at the end of each compounding period, so that
the trust fund is an ordinary annuity. If, instead, she receives
the payments at the beginning of each compounding period,
it is an annuity due. You switch between the two types of
annuity by changing PMT: END at the bottom to PMT:
BEGIN. ■
As mentioned in the text, the present value must be higher
to fund payments at the beginning of each period, because
the money in the account has less time to earn interest.
Example 4 Tony and Maria (see Example 2), having accu-
mulated $100,000 for José Phillipe’s college education,
would now like to make quarterly withdrawals over the next
4 years. How much money can they withdraw each quarter
in order to draw down the account to zero at the end of the 4
years? (Recall that the account pays 4% interest com-
pounded quarterly.)
Solution with Technology
1. Enter the values shown below in the TI-83/84 TVM
Solver.
2. Solve for PMT.
The present value is negative because Tony and Maria do
not possess it; the bank does.
Example 7 Marc and Mira are buying a house, and have
taken out a 30-year, $90,000 mortgage at 8% interest per
year. Mortgage interest is tax-deductible, so it is important
to know how much of a year’s mortgage payments repre-
sents interest. How much interest will Marc and Mira pay in
the ﬁrst year of their mortgage?
Solution with Technology The TI-83/84 has built-in func-
tions to compute the values in an amortization schedule. 
1. First, use the TVM Solver to ﬁnd the monthly payment.
Three functions correspond to the last three columns of
the amortization schedule given in the text: ∑Int,
∑Prn, and bal (found in the menu accessed through
). They all require that the values of I%,
PV, and PMT be entered or calculated ahead of time;
calculating the payment in the TVM Solver in Step 1
accomplishes this.
2. Use ∑Int(m,n,2) to compute the sum of the interest
payments from payment m through payment n. For
example,
∑Int(1,12,2)
will return −7172.81, the total paid in interest in the ﬁrst
year, which answers the question asked in this example.
(The last argument, 2, tells the calculator to round all
intermediate calculations to two decimal places—that is,
the nearest cent—as would the mortgage lender.)
3. Use ∑Prn(m,n,2) to compute the sum of the pay-
ments on principal from payment m through payment n.
For example,
∑Prn(1,12,2)
will return −751.87, the total paid on the principal in
the ﬁrst year.
4. Finally, bal(n,2) ﬁnds the balance of the principal
outstanding after n payments. For example,
bal(12,2)
will return the value 89248.13, the balance remaining at
the end of one year.

Example 9 Suppose that a 5%, 20-year bond sells for
$9800 per $10,000 maturity value. What rate of return will
investors get?
Solution with Technology We can use the TVM Solver in
the TI-83/84 to ﬁnd the interest rate just as we use it to ﬁnd
any other one of the variables.
1. Enter the values shown in the TVM Solver window.
2. Solve for I%. (Recall that I% is the annual interest rate,
corresponding to r in the formula.)
Thus, at $9800 per $10,000 maturity value, these bonds
yield 5.162% compounded semiannually.

Example 1 In August 2005, the Amex Bank of Canada was paying 2.40% interest on savings accounts. If the interest is
compounded quarterly, ﬁnd the future value of a $2000 deposit in 6 years. What is the total interest paid over the period?
Solution with Technology You can either compute compound interest directly or use ﬁnancial functions built into Excel.
The following worksheet has more than we need for this example, but will be useful for other examples in this and the next
section.
E XC E L Technology Guide

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
For this example, the payment amount in B4 should be 0 (we shall use it in the next section).
1. Enter the other numbers as shown. As with other technologies, like the TVM Solver in the TI-83/84 calculator, money
that you pay to others (such as the $2000 you deposit in the bank) should be entered as negative, whereas money that is
paid to you is positive.
2. The formula entered in C6 uses the built-in FV function to calculate the future value based on the entries in column B.
This formula has the following format:
FV(i, n, PMT, PV)
i = interest per period
n = number of periods
PMT = payment per period
PV = present value
Instead of using the built-in FV function, we could use
=-B5*(1+B2/B7)^(B3*B7)
based on the future value formula for compound interest. After calculation the result will appear in cell C6.
Note that we have formatted the cells B4:C6 as currency with two decimal places. If you change the values in column B,
the future value in column C will be automatically recalculated.
Example 2 Megabucks Corporation is issuing 10-year zero coupon bonds. How much would you pay for bonds with a ma-
turity value of $10,000 if you wish to get a return of 6.5% compounded annually?
Solution with Technology You can compute present value in Excel using the PV worksheet function. The following work-
sheet is similar to the one in the preceding example, except that we have entered a formula for computing the present value
from the entered values.
We use B2/B7 for the interest
We use B3*B7 for the number of periods

Example 6 You have $5000 to invest at 6% interest compounded monthly. How long will it take for your investment to
grow to $6000?
Solution with Technology You can compute the requisite length of an investment in Excel using the NPER worksheet
function. The following worksheets show the calculation.
The NPER function computes the number of compounding periods, months in this case, so we divide by B7, the number
of periods per year, to calculate the number of years, which appears as 3.046. So, you need to invest your money for just
over 3 years for it to grow to $6000.

Example 1Your retirement account has $5000 in it and earns 5% interest per year compounded monthly. Every month for
the next 10 years you will deposit $100 into the account. How much money will there be in the account at the end of those
10 years?
Solution with Technology We can use exactly the same worksheet that we used in Example 1 in the preceding section. In
fact, we included the “Payment” row in that worksheet just for this purpose.
Note that the FV function allows us to enter, as the last argument, the amount of money already in the account. Following
the usual convention, we enter the present value and the payment as negative, because these are amounts you pay into the
account.
Example 2 Tony and Maria have just had a son, José Phillipe. They establish an account to accumulate money for his col-
lege education, in which they would like to have $100,000 after 17 years. If the account pays 4% interest per year com-
pounded quarterly, and they make deposits at the end of every quarter, how large must each deposit be for them to reach
their goal?

quired payments.

at which time she will receive the remaining money in the trust, which you would like to be $10,000. The trust will be in-
vested at 7% per year compounded every six months. How large should the trust be?
Solution with Technology You can use the same worksheet as in Example 2 in Section 5.2.

The payment and future value are positive because you (or your niece) will be receiving these amounts from the investment.
Note We have assumed that your niece receives the withdrawals at the end of each compounding period, so that the trust
fund is an ordinary annuity. If, instead, she receives the payments at the beginning of each compounding period, it is an an-
nuity due. You switch to an annuity due by adding an optional last argument of 1 to the PV function (and similarly for the
other ﬁnance functions in Excel).

1. Begin with the worksheet below.
Note the formula for the monthly payment:

The function DOLLAR rounds the payment to the nearest cent, as the bank would.
2. Calculate the interest owed at the end of the ﬁrst month using the formula
=DOLLAR(D2*F$2/12)
in cell B3.
3. The payment on the principal is the remaining part of the payment, so enter
=F$4-B3
in cell C3.
4. Calculate the outstanding principal by subtracting the payment on the principal from the previous outstanding principal,
by entering
=D2-C3
in cell D3.

The result should be something like the following:
6. Adding the calculated interest payments gives us the total interest paid in the ﬁrst year: $7172.81.
Note Excel has built-in functions that compute the interest payment (IPMT) or the payment on the principle (PPMT) in a
given period. We could also have used the built-in future value function (FV) to calculate the outstanding principal each
month. The main problem with using these functions is that, in a sense, they are too accurate. They do not take into account
the fact that payments and interest are rounded to the nearest cent. Over time, this rounding causes the actual value of the
outstanding principal to differ from what the FV function would tell us. In fact, because the actual payment is rounded
slightly upwards (to $660.39 from 660.38811. . .), the principal is reduced slightly faster than necessary and a last payment
of $660.39 would be $2.95 larger than needed to clear out the debt. The lender would reduce the last payment by $2.95 for

this reason; Marc and Mira will pay only $657.44 for their ﬁnal payment. This is common: The last payment on an install-
ment loan is usually slightly larger or smaller than the others, to compensate for the rounding of the monthly payment
amount. ■

Sets and Counting
Introduction
The theory of sets is the foundation for most of mathematics. It also has direct
applications—for example in searching computer databases. We will use set theory ex-
tensively in the chapter on probability, and thus much of this chapter revolves around the
idea of a set of outcomes of a procedure such as rolling a pair of dice or choosing names
from a database. Also important in probability is the theory of counting the number of
elements in a set, which is called combinatorics.
Counting elements is not a trivial proposition; for example, the betting game Lotto
(used in many state lotteries) has you pick six numbers from some range—say, 1–55. If
your six numbers match the six numbers chosen in the “ofﬁcial drawing,” you win the
top prize. How many Lotto tickets would you need to buy to guarantee that you will
win? That is, how many Lotto tickets are possible? By the end of this chapter, we will be
able to answer these questions.
6.1 Sets and Set Operations
In this section we review the basic ideas of set theory with examples in applications that
recur throughout the rest of the chapter.
Sets
Sets and Elements
A set is a collection of items, referred to as the elements of the set.
Visualizing a Set
We usually use a capital letter to name a set and 
W = {Amazon, eBay, Apple}
braces to enclose the elements of a set.
N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}
x ∈A means that x is an element of the set A.
Amazon ∈W (W as above)
If x is not an element of A, we write x /∈A.
Microsoft /∈W
2 ∈N
B = A means that A and B have the same elements.
{5, −9, 1, 3} = {−9, 1, 3, 5}
The order in which the elements are listed does
{1, 2, 3, 4} ̸= {1, 2, 3, 6}
not matter.
B ⊆A means that B is a subset of A; 
{eBay, Apple} ⊆W
every element of B is also an element of A.
{1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆{1, 2, 3, 4}
Set
Elements of the set
quick Examples

One type of set we’ll use often is the set of outcomes of some activity or experi-
ment. For example, if we toss a coin and observe which side faces up, there are two pos-
sible outcomes, heads (H) and tails (T). The set of outcomes of tossing a coin once can
be written
S = {H, T}
As another example, suppose we roll a die that has faces numbered 1 through 6, as usual,
and observe which number faces up. The set of outcomes could be represented as

b. Describe the set of outcomes if the dice are indistinguishable.

a. A systematic way of laying out the set of outcomes for a distinguishable pair of dice
is shown in Figure 1.

In the ﬁrst row all the blue dice show a 1, in the second row a 2, in the third row a 3,
and so on. Similarly, in the ﬁrst column all the green dice show a 1, in the second col-
umn a 2, and so on. The diagonal pairs (top left to bottom right) show all the “dou-
bles.” Using the picture as a guide, we can write the set of 36 outcomes as follows.
S =

(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6),

Distinguishable dice
Notice that S is also the set of outcomes if we roll a single die twice, if we take the ﬁrst
number in each pair to be the outcome of the ﬁrst roll and the second number the out-
come of the second roll.
b. If the dice are truly indistinguishable, we will have no way of knowing which die is
which once they are rolled. Think of placing two identical dice in a closed box and
then shaking the box. When we look inside afterward, there is no way to tell which die
is which. (If we make a small marking on one of the dice or somehow keep track of it
as it bounces around, we are distinguishing the dice.) We regard two dice as indistin-
guishable if we make no attempt to distinguish them. Thus, for example, the two dif-
ferent outcomes (1,3) and (3,1) from part (a) would represent the same outcome in
part (b) (one die shows a 3 and the other a 1). Because the set of outcomes should con-
tain each outcome only once, we can remove (3,1). Following this approach gives the
following smaller set of outcomes:
S =


Set Operations
A ∪B is the union of A and B, the set of all elements that are either in A or in B (or in
both).
A ∪B = {x | x ∈A or x ∈B}
A ∩B is the intersection of A and B, the set of all elements that are common to
A and B.
A ∩B = {x | x ∈A and x ∈B}
Logical Equivalents
Union: For an element to be in A ∪B, it must be in A or in B.
Intersection: For an element to be in A ∩B, it must be in A and in B.

Note Mathematicians always use “or” in its inclusive sense: one thing or another or

There is one other operation we use, called the complement of a set A, which,
roughly speaking, is the set of things not in A.

6.1 Sets and Set Operations
399
Q: Why only “roughly”? Why not just form the set of things not in A?
A: This would amount to assuming that there is a set of all things. (It would be the complement
of the empty set.) Although tempting, talking about entities such as the “set of all things” leads
to paradoxes.1 Instead, we first need to fix a set S of all objects under consideration, or the uni-
verse of discourse, which we generally call the universal set for the discussion. For example,
when we search the web, we take S to be the set of all web pages. When talking about integers,
we take S to be the set of all integers. In other words, our choice of universal set depends on the
context. The complement of a set A ⊆S is then the set of things in S that are not in A. ■
1 The most famous such paradox is called “Russell’s Paradox,” after the mathematical logician (and philosopher
and paciﬁst) Bertrand Russell. It goes like this: If there were a set of all things, then there would also be a
(smaller) set of all sets. Call it S. Now, because S is the set of all sets, it must contain itself as a member. In other
words, S ∈S. Let P be the subset of S consisting of all sets that are not members of themselves. Now we pose
the following question: Is P a member of itself? If it is, then, because it is the set of all sets that are not mem-
bers of themselves, it is not a member of itself. On the other hand, if it is not a member of itself, then it quali-
ﬁes as an element of P. In other words, it is a member of itself! Because neither can be true, something is wrong.
What is wrong is the assumption that there is such a thing as the set of all sets or the set of all things.
quick Example
Complement
If S is the universal set and A ⊆S, then A′ is the complement of A (in S), the set of all
elements of S not in A.
A′ = {x ∈S | x /∈A} = Gold Region Below
Logical Equivalent
For an element to be in A′, it must be in S but not in A.
If S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} and A = {a, b, c, d} then
A′ = {e, f, g}

Sets and Counting
+Before we go on... Computer databases and the web can be searched using so-called
“Boolean searches.” These are search requests using “and,” “or,” and “not.” Using “and”
gives the intersection of separate searches, using “or” gives the union, and using “not”
gives the complement. In the next section we’ll see how web search engines allow such
searches. ■
Another search, this time for customers who have purchased mysteries, yields the subset
B = {Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger}
A third search, for customers who had registered with the site but not used their ﬁrst-
time customer discount yields the subset
C = {Millikan}
Use set operations to describe the following subsets:
a. The subset of customers who have purchased either cookbooks or mysteries
b. The subset of customers who have purchased both cookbooks and mysteries
c. The subset of customers who have not purchased cookbooks
d. The subset of customers who have purchased cookbooks but have not used their ﬁrst-
time customer discount
Solution Figure 4 shows two alternative Venn diagram representations of the database.
Although the second version shows C overlapping A and B, the placement of the names
inside shows that there are no customers in those overlaps.
a. The subset of customers who have bought either cookbooks or mysteries is
A ∪B = {Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Dirac}
b. The subset of customers who have bought both cookbooks and mysteries is
A ∩B = {Bohr, Heisenberg}
c. The subset of customers who have not bought cookbooks is
A′ = {Millikan, Schrödinger}
Note that, for the universal set, we are using the set S of all customers in the database.
d. The subset of customers who have bought cookbooks but have not used their ﬁrst-
time purchase discount is the empty set
A ∩C = ∅
When the intersection of two sets is empty, we say that the two sets are disjoint. In a
Venn diagram, disjoint sets are drawn as regions that don’t overlap, as in Figure 5.*
* People new to set theory sometimes ﬁnd it strange to consider the empty set a valid set. Here is one of the
times where it is very useful to do so. If we did not, we would have to say that A ∩C was deﬁned only when
A and C had something in common. Having to deal with the fact that this set operation was not always deﬁned
would quickly get tiresome.

Cartesian Product
The Cartesian product of two sets, A and B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) with
a ∈A and b ∈B.
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈A and b ∈B}
In words, A × B is the set of all ordered pairs whose ﬁrst component is in A and whose
second component is in B.
1. If A = {a, b} and B = {1, 2, 3}, then
A × B = {(a, 1), (a, 2), (a, 3), (b, 1), (b, 2), (b, 3)}
Visualizing A × B
2. If S = {H, T}, then
S × S = {(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)}
In other words, if S is the set of outcomes of tossing a coin once, then S × S is the set
of outcomes of tossing a coin twice.
3. If S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, then
S × S =

Example 5 Representing Cartesian Products 
The manager of an automobile dealership has collected data on the number of pre-
owned Acura, Inﬁniti, Lexus, and Mercedes cars the dealership has from the 2004, 2005,
and 2006 model years. In entering this information on a spreadsheet, the manager would
like to have each spreadsheet cell represent a particular year and make. Describe this set
of cells.

Chapter 6
Sets and Counting
+Before we go on... The arrangement in the spreadsheet in Example 5 is consistent with
the matrix notation in Chapter 2. We could also have used the elements of Y as column
labels along the top and the elements of M as row labels down the side. Along those
lines, we can also visualize the Cartesian product Y × M as a set of points in the xy-
plane (“Cartesian plane”) as shown in Figure 6.
Solution Because each cell represents a year and a make, we can think of the cell as a
pair (year, make), as in (2004, Acura). Thus, the set of cells can be thought of as a Carte-
sian product:
Y = {2004, 2005, 2006}
Year of car
M = {Acura, Inﬁniti, Lexus, Mercedes}
Make of car
Y × M =



(2004, Acura) (2004, Inﬁniti) (2004, Lexus) (2004, Mercedes)
(2005, Acura) (2005, Inﬁniti) (2005, Lexus) (2005, Mercedes)
(2006, Acura) (2006, Inﬁniti) (2006, Lexus) (2006, Mercedes)

Thus, the manager might arrange the spreadsheet as follows:
The highlighting shows the 12 cells to be ﬁlled in, representing the numbers of cars of
each year and make. For example, in cell B2 should go the number of 2004 Acuras the
dealership has.

The Many Meanings of “And”
Q: Suppose A is the set of actors and B is the set of all baseball players. Then the set of all
actors and baseball players is A ∩B, right?
A: Wrong. The fact that the word “and” appears in the description of a set does not always
mean that the set is an intersection; the word “and” can mean different things in different con-
texts. A ∩B refers to the set of elements that are in both A and B, hence to actors who are also
baseball players. On the other hand, the set of all actors and baseball players is the set of peo-
ple who are either actors or baseball players (or both), which is A ∪B. We can use the word
“and” to describe both sets:
A ∩B = {people who are both actors and baseball players}
A ∪B = {people who are actors or baseball players} = {all actors and baseball players}

6.2 Cardinality
In this section, we begin to look at a deceptively simple idea: the size of a set, which we
call its cardinality.

If A is a ﬁnite set, then its cardinality is
n(A) = number of elements in A

1. Let S = {a, b, c}. Then n(S) = 3.
2. Let S be the set of outcomes when two distinguishable dice are rolled. Then n(S) = 36

Cardinality of a Union
If A and B are ﬁnite sets, then
n(A ∪B) = n(A) + n(B) −n(A ∩B)
In particular, if A and B are disjoint (meaning that A ∩B = ∅), then 
n(A ∪B) = n(A) + n(B)
(When A and B are disjoint we say that A ∪B is a disjoint union.)

Counting the elements in a small, simple set is straightforward. To count the ele-
ments in a large, complicated set, we try to describe the set as built of simpler sets using
the set operations. We then need to know how to calculate the number of elements in, for
example, a union, based on the number of elements in the simpler sets whose union we
are taking.
The Cardinality of a Union
How can we calculate n(A ∪B) if we know n(A) and n(B)? Our ﬁrst guess might be
that n(A ∪B) is n(A) + n(B). But consider a simple example. Let
A = {a, b, c}
and
B = {b, c, d}
Then A ∪B = {a, b, c, d} so n(A ∪B) = 4, but n(A) + n(B) = 3 + 3 = 6. The calcu-
lation n(A) + n(B) gives the wrong answer because the elements b and c are counted
twice, once for being in A and again for being in B. To correct for this overcounting, we
need to subtract the number of elements that get counted twice, which is the number of
elements that A and B have in common, or n(A ∩B) = 2 in this case. So, we get the
right number for n(A ∪B) from the following calculation:
n(A) + n(B) −n(A ∩B) = 3 + 3 −2 = 4
This argument leads to the following general formula.

6.2 Cardinality
407
Example 1 Web Searches
In February, 2005, a search using Google® for “manned Jupiter mission” yielded
32 websites containing that phrase, and a search for “Venus terraforming project”
yielded 36 sites. A search for sites containing both phrases yielded only 4 websites. How
many websites contained either “manned Jupiter mission,” “Venus terraforming
project,” or both?
Solution Let A be the set of sites containing “manned Jupiter mission” and let B be the
set of sites containing “Venus terraforming project.” We are told that
n(A) = 32
n(B) = 36
n(A ∩B) = 4
“manned Jupiter mission” AND “Venus terraforming project”
The formula for the cardinality of the union tells us that
n(A ∪B) = n(A) + n(B) −n(A ∩B) = 32 + 36 −4 = 64
So, 64 sites in the Google database contained one or both of the phrases “manned Jupiter
mission” or “Venus terraforming project.” (This was subsequently conﬁrmed by doing a
search for “manned Jupiter mission” OR “Venus terraforming project.”)
quick Examples 1. If A = {a, b, c, d} and B = {b, c, d, e, f}, then 
n(A ∪B) = n(A) + n(B) −n(A ∩B) = 4 + 5 −3 = 6
In fact, A ∪B = {a, b, c, d, e, f}.
2. If A = {a, b, c} and B = {d, e, f}, then A ∩B = ∅, so 
n(A ∪B) = n(A) + n(B) = 3 + 3 = 6
+Before we go on... Each search engine has a different way of specifying a search for a
union or an intersection. At Google or AltaVista®, you can use “OR” for the union and
“AND” for the intersection.
Although the formula n(A ∪B) = n(A) + n(B) −n(A ∩B) always holds mathe-
matically, you may sometimes ﬁnd that, in an actual search, the numbers don’t add up.
The reason? Search engines are not perfect. AltaVista, for example, explains that the
number reported may be only an estimate of the actual number of sites in their database
containing the search words.3 ■
3 E-mail correspondence with the authors, January, 2002.
Q: Is there a similar formula for n(A ∩B)?
A: The formula for the cardinality of a union can also be thought of as a formula for the cardi-
nality of an intersection. We can solve for n(A ∩B) to get
n(A ∩B) = n(A) + n(B) −n(A ∪B)
In fact, we can think of this formula as an equation relating four quantities. If we know any
three of them, we can use the equation to find the fourth (see Example 2 below). ■

In February, 2005, a search at Amazon.com found 53,000 books on cooking.* Of these,
6000 were on American cooking, 2000 were on vegetarian cooking, and 7000 were on
either American or vegetarian cooking (or both). How many of these books were not on
both American and vegetarian cooking?
Solution Let S be the set of all 53,000 books on cooking, let A be the set of books on
American cooking, and let B be the set of books on vegetarian cooking. We wish to ﬁnd
the size of the complement of the set of books on both American and vegetarian cooking—
that is, n((A ∩B)′). Using the formula for the cardinality of a complement, we have
n((A ∩B)′) = n(S) −n(A ∩B) = 53,000 −n(A ∩B)

Cardinality of a Complement

n(A) = n(S) −n(A′)
Visualizing Cardinality of a Complement
If S = {a, b, c, d, e, f} and A = {a, b, c, d}, then 
n(A′) = n(S) −n(A) = 6 −4 = 2

Q: Is there a similar formula for n(A′)?
A: We can get a formula for the cardinality of a complement as follows: If S is our universal
set and A ⊆S, then S is the disjoint union of A and its complement. That is,
S = A ∪A′
and
A ∩A′ = ∅
Applying the cardinality formula for a disjoint union, we get
n(S) = n(A) + n(A′)
We can solve for n(A′) or for n(A) to get the following formulas. ■

Let S be the set of all these iPods, Powerbooks, and iMacs. Let D be the set of all iPods
sold during the stated quarters, let M be the set of iMacs sold during the stated quarters,
and let A be the set of all items sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. Describe the follow-
ing sets and compute their cardinality:
a. A′
b. D ∩A′
c. (D ∩A)′
d. M ∪A
Solution Because all the ﬁgures are stated in thousands of units, we’ll give our calcu-
lations and results in thousands of units as well.
a. A′ is the set of all items not sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. To compute its cardi-
nality, we could add the totals for all the other quarters listed in the rightmost column: 
n(A′) = 1320 + 1470 = 2790 thousand items
Alternatively, we can use the formula for the cardinality of a complement (referring
again to the totals in the table):
n(A′) = n(S) −n(A) = 3560 −770 = 2790 thousand items
b. D ∩A′ is the intersection of the set of all iPods and the set of all items not sold in the
fourth quarter of 2003. In other words, it is the set of all iPods not sold in the fourth

7000 = 6000 + 2000 −n(A ∩B)
which we can solve to get
n(A ∩B) = 1000
Therefore,
n((A ∩B)′) = 53,000 −n(A ∩B) = 53,000 −1000 = 52,000
So, 52,000 of the books on cooking were not on both American and vegetarian cooking.

Sets and Counting
To determine the cardinality of a union of three or more sets, like n(A ∪B ∪C),
we can think of A ∪B ∪C as a union of two sets, (A ∪B) and C, and then analyze each
piece using the techniques we already have. Alternatively, there are formulas for the car-
dinalities of unions of any number of sets, but these formulas get more and more com-
plicated as the number of sets grows. In many applications, like the following example,
we can use Venn diagrams instead.
To compute it, we can use the formula for the cardinality of a union:
n(M ∪A) = n(M) + n(A) −n(M ∩A)
= 720 + 770 −250 = 1240 thousand items
From the ﬁgure:
n(D ∩A′) = 860 + 1030 = 1890 thousand iPods
c. D ∩A is the set of all iPods sold in the fourth quarter of 2003, and so (D ∩A)′ is the
set of all items other than iPods sold in the fourth quarter of 2003:

Example 4 Reading Lists
A survey of 300 college students found that 100 had read War and Peace, 120 had
read Crime and Punishment, and 100 had read The Brothers Karamazov. It also found
that 40 had read only War and Peace, 70 had read War and Peace but not The
Brothers Karamazov, and 80 had read The Brothers Karamazov but not Crime and
Punishment. Only 10 had read all three novels. How many had read none of these
three novels?
Solution There are four sets mentioned in the problem: the universe S consisting of
the 300 students surveyed, the set W of students who had read War and Peace, the set
C of students who had read Crime and Punishment, and the set K of students who had
read The Brothers Karamazov. Figure 7 shows a Venn diagram representing these
sets.
We have put labels in the various regions of the diagram to represent the number of
students in each region. For example, x represents the number of students in W ∩C ∩K ,
which is the number of students who have read all three novels. We are told that this num-
ber is 10, so
x = 10
(You should draw the diagram for yourself and ﬁll in the numbers as we go along.) We
are also told that 40 students had read only War and Peace, so 
t = 40
We are given none of the remaining regions directly. However, because 70 had read War
and Peace but not The Brothers Karamazov, we see that t and y must add up to 70. Be-
cause we already know that t = 40, it follows that y = 30. Further, because a total of
100 students had read War and Peace, we have 
x + y + t + w = 100
Substituting the known values of x, y, and t gives
10 + 30 + 40 + w = 100
so w = 20. Because 80 students had read The Brothers Karamazov but not Crime and
Punishment, we see that v + w = 80, so v = 60 (because we know w = 20). We
can now calculate z using the fact that a total of 100 students had read The Brothers
Karamazov:
60 + 20 + 10 + z = 100
giving z = 10. Similarly, we can now get u using the fact that 120 students had read
Crime and Punishment:
10 + 30 + 10 + u = 120
giving u = 70. Of the 300 students surveyed, we’ve now found x + y + z + w + t +
u + v = 240. This leaves
r = 60
who had read none of the three novels.

Sets and Counting
Example 5 Coin Tosses
a. If we toss a coin twice and observe the sequence of heads and tails, how many possi-
ble outcomes are there?
b. If we toss a coin three times, how many possible outcomes are there?
c. If we toss a coin ten times, how many possible outcomes are there?
Solution
a. Let A = {H, T} be the set of possible outcomes when a coin is tossed once. The set of
outcomes when a coin is tossed twice is A × A, which has
n(A × A) = n(A)n(A) = 2 × 2 = 4
possible outcomes.
The Cardinality of a Cartesian Product
We’ve covered all the operations except Cartesian product. To ﬁnd a formula for n(A × B),
consider the following simple example:
A = {H, T}
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
so that
A × B = {H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6}
As we saw in Example 5 in Section 6.1, the elements of A × B can be arranged in a table
or spreadsheet with n(A) = 2 rows and n(B) = 6 elements in each row.
In a region with 2 rows and 6 columns, there are 2 × 6 = 12 cells. So,
n(A × B) = n(A)n(B)
in this case. There is nothing particularly special about this example, however, and that
formula holds true in general.
quick Example
Cardinality of a Cartesian Product
If A and B are ﬁnite sets, then
n(A × B) = n(A)n(B)
If A = {a, b, c} and B = {x, y, z, w}, then 
n(A × B) = n(A)n(B) = 3 × 4 = 12

+Before we go on... We can start to see the power of these formulas for cardinality. In
Example 5, we were able to calculate that there are 1024 possible outcomes when we
toss a coin 10 times without writing out all 1024 possibilities and counting them. ■
b. When a coin is tossed three times, we can think of the set of outcomes as the prod-
uct of the set of outcomes for the ﬁrst two tosses, which is A × A, and the set of out-
comes for the third toss, which is just A. The set of outcomes for the three tosses
is then (A × A) × A, which we usually write as A × A × A or A3. The number of
outcomes is
n((A × A) × A) = n(A × A)n(A) = (2 × 2) × 2 = 8
c. Considering the result of part (b), we can easily see that the set of outcomes here is
A10 = A × A × · · · × A (10 copies of A), or the set of ordered sequences of ten Hs
and Ts. It’s also easy to see that
n(A10) = [n(A)]10 = 210 = 1024

6.3 The Addition and Multiplication Principles
Let’s start with a really simple example. You walk into an ice cream parlor and ﬁnd that
you can choose between ice cream, of which there are 15 ﬂavors, and frozen yogurt, of
which there are 5 ﬂavors. How many different selections can you make? Clearly, you
have 15 + 5 = 20 different desserts from which to choose. Mathematically, this is an
example of the formula for the cardinality of a disjoint union: If we let A be the set of
ice creams you can choose from, and B the set of frozen yogurts, then A ∩B = ∅and
we want n(A ∪B). But the formula for the cardinality of a disjoint union is
n(A ∪B) = n(A) + n(B), which gives 15 + 5 = 20 in this case.
This example illustrates a very useful general principle.
Here is another simple example. In that ice cream parlor, not only can you choose
from 15 ﬂavors of ice cream, but you can also choose from 3 different sizes of cone.
How many different ice cream cones can you select from? If we let A again be the set of
ice cream ﬂavors and now let C be the set of cone sizes, we want to pick a ﬂavor and a
size. That is, we want to pick an element of A × C, the Cartesian product. To ﬁnd the
number of choices we have, we use the formula for the cardinality of a Cartesian prod-
uct: n(A × C) = n(A)n(C). In this case, we get 15 × 3 = 45 different ice cream cones
we can select.
This example illustrates another general principle.

Addition Principle
When choosing among r disjoint alternatives, if
alternative 1 has n1 possible outcomes,
alternative 2 has n2 possible outcomes,
. . .
alternative r has nr possible outcomes,
then you have a total of n1 + n2 + · · · + nr possible outcomes.
At a restaurant you can choose among 8 chicken dishes, 10 beef dishes, 4 seafood
dishes, and 12 vegetarian dishes. This gives a total of 8 + 10 + 4 + 12 = 34 different
dishes to choose from.

6.3 The Addition and Multiplication Principles

quick Example
Multiplication Principle
When making a sequence of choices with r steps, if
step 1 has n1 possible outcomes
step 2 has n2 possible outcomes
. . .
step r has nr possible outcomes
then you have a total of n1 × n2 × · · · × nr possible outcomes.
At a restaurant you can choose among 5 appetizers, 34 main dishes, and 10 desserts.
This gives a total of 5 × 34 × 10 = 1700 different meals (each including one appetizer,
one main dish, and one dessert) from which you can choose.
Example 1 Desserts
You walk into an ice cream parlor and ﬁnd that you can choose between ice cream, of
which there are 15 ﬂavors, and frozen yogurt, of which there are 5 ﬂavors. In addition,
you can choose among 3 different sizes of cones for your ice cream or 2 different sizes
of cups for your yogurt. How many different desserts can you choose from?
Solution It helps to think about a deﬁnite procedure for deciding which dessert you
will choose. Here is one we can use:
Alternative 1: An ice cream cone
Step 1 Choose a ﬂavor.
Step 2 Choose a size.
Alternative 2: A cup of frozen yogurt
Step 1 Choose a ﬂavor.
Step 2 Choose a size.
That is, we can choose between alternative 1 and alternative 2. If we choose alterna-
tive 1, we have a sequence of two choices to make: ﬂavor and size. The same is true of
alternative 2. We shall call a procedure in which we make a sequence of decisions a
decision algorithm.* Once we have a decision algorithm, we can use the addition and
multiplication principles to count the number of possible outcomes.
Alternative 1: An ice cream cone
Step 1 Choose a ﬂavor; 15 choices
Step 2 Choose a size; 3 choices
There are 15 × 3 = 45 possible choices in alternative 1.
Multiplication Principle
Alternative 2: A cup of frozen yogurt
Step 1 Choose a ﬂavor; 5 choices
Step 2 Choose a size; 2 choices
There are 5 × 2 = 10 possible choices in alternative 2.
Multiplication Principle
So, there are 45 + 10 = 55 possible choices of desserts.
Addition Principle
Things get more interesting when we have to use the addition and multiplication
principles in tandem.
* An algorithm is a procedure with deﬁnite rules for what to do at every step.

To count the number of possible
gadgets, pretend you are
designing a gadget, and list the
decisions to be made at each stage.

+Before we go on... Decision algorithms can be illustrated by decision trees. To sim-
plify the picture, suppose we had fewer choices in Example 1—say, only 2 choices of ice
cream ﬂavor: vanilla and chocolate, and 2 choices of yogurt ﬂavor: banana and rasp-
berry. This gives us a total of 2 × 3 + 2 × 2 = 10 possible desserts. We can illustrate the
decisions we need to make when choosing what to buy in the diagram in Figure 8, called
a decision tree.

Decision Algorithm
A decision algorithm is a procedure in which we make a sequence of decisions. We can
use decision algorithms to determine the number of possible items by pretending we are
designing such an item (for example, an ice-cream cone) and listing the decisions or
choices we should make at each stage of the process.
An iPod is available in two sizes. The larger size comes in 2 colors and the smaller size
(the Mini) comes in 4 colors. A decision algorithm for “designing” an iPod is:
Alternative 1: Select Large:
Step 1 Choose a color: 2 choices
(so, there are 2 choices for Alternative 1)
Alternative 2: Select a Mini:
Step 1 Choose a color: 4 choices
(so, there are 4 choices for Alternative 2)
Thus, there are 2 + 4 = 6 possible choices of iPods.
We do not use decision trees much in this chapter because, while they provide a good
way of thinking about decision algorithms, they’re not really practical for counting large
sets. Similar diagrams will be very useful, however, in the chapter on probability. ■

The next example illustrates the need to select your decision algorithm with care.
Example 2 Exams
An exam is broken into two parts, Part A and Part B, both of which you are required to
do. In Part A you can choose between answering 10 true-false questions or answering 4
multiple-choice questions, each of which has 5 answers to choose from. In Part B you
can choose between answering 8 true-false questions and answering 5 multiple-choice
questions, each of which has 4 answers to choose from. How many different collections
of answers are possible?
Solution While deciding what answers to write down, we use the following decision
algorithm:
Step 1 Do Part A.
Alternative 1: Answer the 10 true-false questions.
Steps 1–10 Choose true or false for each question; 2 choices each.
There are 2 × 2 × · · · × 2 = 210 = 1024 choices in alternative 1.
Alternative 2: Answer the 4 multiple-choice questions.
Steps 1–4 Choose one answer for each question; 5 choices each.
5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 54 = 625 choices in alternative 2.
1024 + 625 = 1649 choices in step 1
Step 2 Do Part B.
Alternative 1: Answer the 8 true-false questions; 2 choices each.
28 = 256 choices in alternative 1
Alternative 2: Answer the 5 multiple-choice questions, 4 choices each.
45 = 1024 choices in alternative 2
256 + 1024 = 1280 choices in step 2
There are 1649 × 1280 = 2,110,720 different collections of answers possible.
Caution
For a decision algorithm to give the correct number of possible items, it must be the case
that changing one or more choices results in a different item (see Example 3).
Example 3 Scrabble®
You are playing Scrabble® and have the following letters to work with: k, e, r, e. Because
you are losing the game, you would like to use all your letters to make a single word, but
you can’t think of any four-letter words using all these letters. In desperation, you decide
to list all the four-letter sequences possible to see if there are any valid words among
them. How large is your list?
Solution It may ﬁrst occur to you to try the following decision algorithm.
Step 1 Select the ﬁrst letter; 4 choices.
Step 2 Select the second letter; 3 choices.

420
Chapter 6
Sets and Counting
Step 3 Select the third letter; 2 choices.
Step 4 Select the last letter; 1 choice.
This gives 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 choices. However, something is wrong with the
algorithm.
Q: What is wrong with this decision algorithm?
A: We didn’t take into account the fact that there are two “e”s;* different decisions in
Steps 1–4 can produce the same sequence. Suppose, for example, that we selected the first “e”
in Step 1, the second “e” in Step 2, and then the “k” and the “r.” This would produce the sequence
“eekr.” If we selected the second “e” in Step 1, the first “e” in Step 2, and then the “k” and “r,” we
would obtain the same sequence: “eekr.” In other words, the decision algorithm produces two
copies of the sequence “eekr” in the associated decision tree. (In fact, it produces two copies of
each possible sequence of the letters.) 
For a decision algorithm to be valid, each sequence of choices must produce a different result. ■
Because our original algorithm is not valid, we need a new one. Here is a strategy
that works nicely for this example. Imagine, as before, that we are going to construct
a sequence of four letters. This time we are going to imagine that we have a sequence
of four empty slots:
, and instead of selecting letters to ﬁll the slots from
left to right, we are going to select slots in which to place each of the letters. Remem-
ber that we have to use these letters: k, e, r, e. We proceed as follows, leaving the “e”s
until last.
Step 1 Select an empty slot for the k; 4 choices (e.g. 
)
Step 2 Select an empty slot for the r; 3 choices (e.g. 
).
Step 3 Place the “e”s in the remaining two slots; 1 choice!
Thus the multiplication principle yields 4 × 3 × 1 = 12 choices.
* Consider the following extreme case: If all four letters were “e,” then there would be only a single sequence:
“eeee” and not the 24 predicted by the decision algorithm.
k
r
k
+Before we go on... You should try constructing a decision tree for Example 3, and you
will see that each sequence of four letters is produced exactly once when we use the cor-
rect (second) decision algorithm. ■
FAQs
Creating and Testing a Decision Algorithm
Q: How do I set up a decision algorithm to count how many items there are in a given scenario?
A: Pretend that you are designing such an item (for example, pretend that you are designing an
ice-cream cone) and come up with a step-by-step procedure for doing so, listing the decisions
you should make at each stage. ■
Q: Once I have my decision algorithm, how do I check if it is valid?
A: Ask yourself the following question: “Is it possible to get the same item (the exact same 
ice-cream cone, say) by making different decisions when applying the algorithm?” If the answer
is “yes,” then your decision algorithm is invalid. Otherwise, it is valid. ■

Sets and Counting
Permutations and Combinations
Certain classes of counting problems come up frequently, and it is useful to develop for-
mulas to deal with them.
Example 1 Casting
Ms. Birkitt, the English teacher at Brakpan Girls High School, wanted to stage a pro-
duction of R. B. Sheridan’s play, The School for Scandal. The casting was going well
until she was left with ﬁve unﬁlled characters and ﬁve seniors who were yet to be as-
signed roles. The characters were Lady Sneerwell, Lady Teazle, Mrs. Candour, Maria,
and Snake; while the unassigned seniors were April, May, June, Julia and Augusta. How
many possible assignments are there?
Solution To decide on a speciﬁc assignment, we use the following algorithm:
Step 1 Choose a senior to play Lady Sneerwell; 5 choices.
Step 2 Choose one of the remaining seniors to play Lady Teazle; 4 choices.
Step 3 Choose one of the now remaining seniors to play Mrs. Candour; 3 choices.
Step 4 Choose one of the now remaining seniors to play Maria; 2 choices.
Step 5 Choose the remaining senior to play Snake; 1 choice.
Thus, there are 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 possible assignments of seniors to roles.
What the situation in Example 1 has in common with many others is that we start
with a set—here the set of seniors—and we want to know how many ways we can put
the elements of that set in order in a list. In this example, an ordered list of the ﬁve
seniors—say,
1. May
2. Augusta
3. June
4. Julia
5. April
corresponds to a particular casting:
Cast
Lady Sneerwell
May
Lady Teazle
Augusta
Mrs. Candour
June
Maria
Julia
Snake
April
We call an ordered list of items a permutation of those items.
If we have n items, how many permutations of those items are possible? We can use
a decision algorithm similar to the one we used in the preceding example to select a
permutation.
Step 1 Select the ﬁrst item; n choices.
Step 2 Select the second item; n −1 choices.

Step 3 Select the third item; n −2 choices.
· · ·
Step n −1 Select the next-to-last item; 2 choices.
Step n Select the last item; 1 choice.
Thus, there are n × (n −1) × (n −2) × · · · × 2 × 1 possible permutations. We call
this number n factorial, which we write as n!.

quick Examples
Permutations
A permutation of n items is an ordered list of those items. The number of possible per-
mutations of n items is given by n factorial, which is
n! = n × (n −1) × (n −2) × · · · × 2 × 1
for n a positive integer, and
0! = 1
Visualizing Permutations
Permutations of 3 colors in a ﬂag:
1. The number of permutations of 5 items is 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.
2. The number of ways 4 CDs can be played in sequence is 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.
3. The number of ways 3 cars can be matched with 3 drivers is 3! = 6.
3!  3  2  1  6 possible flags
Sometimes, instead of constructing an ordered list of all the items of a set, we might
want to construct a list of only some of the items, as in the next example.
Example 2 Corporations*
At the end of 2001, the 10 largest companies (by market capitalization) listed on the
New York Stock Exchange were, in alphabetical order, American International Group,
AOL Time Warner, Citigroup, Exxon Mobil Corp., General Electric Co., IBM, Johnson
& Johnson, Merck & Co., Pﬁzer, and Wal-Mart Stores. You would like to apply to six of
these companies for a job and you would like to list them in order of job preference.
How many such ordered lists are possible?
Solution We want to count ordered lists, but we can’t use the permutation formula
because we don’t want all 10 companies in the list, just 6 of them. So we fall back to a
decision algorithm.
Step 1 Choose the ﬁrst company; 10 choices.
Step 2 Choose the second company; 9 choices.

Step 3 Choose the third one; 8 choices;
Step 4 Choose the fourth one; 7 choices.
Step 5 Choose the ﬁfth one; 6 choices.
Step 6 Choose the sixth one; 5 choices.
Thus, there are 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 = 151,200 possible lists of six. We call this
number the number of permutations of 6 items chosen from 10, or the number of
permutations of 10 items taken 6 at a time.

Chapter 6
Sets and Counting
Before we go on… We wrote the answer as the product 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5. But
it is useful to notice that we can write this number in a more compact way:
10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
4 × 3 × 2 × 1
= 10!
4! =
10!
(10 −6)!
■

quick Example
Permutations of n items taken r at a time
A permutation of n items taken r at a time is an ordered list of r items chosen from a
set of n items. The number of permutations of n items taken r at a time is given by
P(n, r) = n × (n −1) × (n −2) × · · · × (n −r + 1)
(there are r terms multiplied together). We can also write
P(n, r) =
n!
(n −r)!
The number of permutations of 6 items taken 2 at a time is
P(6, 2) = 6 × 5 = 30
which we could also calculate as
P(6, 2) =
6!
(6 −2)! = 6!
4! = 720
24 = 30
So, we can generalize our deﬁnition of permutation to allow for the case in which
we use only some of the items, not all. Check that, if r = n below, this is the same deﬁ-
nition we gave above.
What if we don’t care about the order of the items we’re choosing? Consider the fol-
lowing example:
Example 3 Corporations
Suppose we simply wanted to pick two of the 10 companies listed in Example 2 to apply
to, without regard to order. How many possible choices do we have? What if we wanted
to choose six to apply to, without regard to order?

6.4 Permutations and Combinations
429
In Example 3 we were concerned with counting not the number of ordered lists, but
the number of unordered sets of companies. For ordered lists we used the word permu-
tation; for unordered sets we use the word combination.
quick Example
Permutations and Combinations
A permutation of n items taken r at a time is an ordered list of r items chosen from n. A
combination of n items taken r at a time is an unordered set of r items chosen from n.
Visualizing
Note Because lists are usually understood to be ordered, when we refer to a list of items,
we will always mean an ordered list. Similarly, because sets are understood to be un-
ordered, when we refer to a set of items we will always mean an unordered set. In short:
Lists are ordered. Sets are unordered. ■
There are six permutations of the three letters a, b, c taken two at a time:
1. a, b;
2. b, a;
3. a, c;
4. c, a;
5. b, c;
6. c, b.
There are six lists containing two of the letters a, b, c
There are three combinations of the three letters a, b, c taken two at a time:
1. {a, b};
2. {a, c};
3. {b, c}.
There are three sets containing two of the letters a, b, c

Solution Our ﬁrst guess might be P(10, 2) = 10 × 9 = 90. However, that is the num-
ber of ordered lists of two companies. We said that we don’t care which is ﬁrst and which
second. For example, we consider the list
1. Merck
2. Pﬁzer
to be the same as
1. Pﬁzer
2. Merck.
Because every set of two companies occurs twice in the 90 lists, once in one order and
again in the reverse order, we would count every set of two twice. Thus, there are
90/2 = 45 possible choices of two companies.
Now, if we wish to pick six companies, again we might start with P(10, 6) =
151,200. But now, every set of six companies appears as many times as there are differ-
ent orders in which they could be listed. Six things can be listed in 6! = 720 different or-
ders, so the number of ways of choosing six companies is 151,200/720 = 210.
How do we count the number of possible combinations of n items taken r at a time?
We generalize the calculation done in Example 3. The number of permutations is
P(n, r), but each set of r items occurs r! times because this is the number of ways in
which those r items can be ordered. So, the number of combinations is P(n, r)/r!.

Sets and Counting
quick Examples
Combinations of n items taken r at a time
The number of combinations of n items taken r at a time is given by
C(n, r) = P(n, r)
r!
= n × (n −1) × (n −2) × · · · × (n −r + 1)
r!
We can also write
C(n, r) =
n!
r!(n −r)!
1. The number of combinations of 6 items taken 2 at a time is
C(6, 2) = 6 × 5
2 × 1 = 15
which we can also calculate as
C(6, 2) =
6!
2!(6 −2)! =
6!
2!4! =
720
2 × 24 = 15
2. The number of sets of 4 marbles chosen from 6 is
C(6, 4) = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3
4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 15
Note There are other common notations for C(n, r). Calculators often have nCr. In 
mathematics we often write 
n
r

which is also known as a binomial coefﬁcient.
Because C(n, r) is the number of ways of choosing a set of r items from n, it is often
read “n choose r.” ■
Example 4 Calculating Combinations
Calculate
a. C(11, 3)
b. C(11, 8).
Solution The easiest way to calculate C(n, r) by hand is to use the formula
C(n, r) = n × (n −1) × (n −2) × · · · × (n −r + 1)
r!
= n × (n −1) × (n −2) × · · · × (n −r + 1)
r × (r −1) × (r −2) × · · · × 1
Both the numerator and the denominator have r factors, so we can begin with n/r and
then continue multiplying by decreasing numbers on the top and the bottom until we
hit 1 in the denominator. When calculating, it helps to cancel common factors from the
numerator and denominator before doing the multiplication in either one.

+Before we go on... It is no coincidence that the answers for parts (a) and (b) of Exam-
ple 4 are the same. Consider what each represents. C(11, 3) is the number of ways of
choosing 3 items from 11—for example, electing 3 trustees from a slate of 11. Electing
those 3 is the same as choosing the 8 who do not get elected. Thus, there are exactly as
many ways to choose 3 items from 11 as there are ways to choose 8 items from 11. So,
C(11, 3) = C(11, 8). In general,
C(n, r) = C(n, n −r)
We can also see this equality by using the formula
C(n, r) =
n!
r!(n −r)!
If we substitute n −r for r, we get exactly the same formula.
Use the equality C(n, r) = C(n, n −r) to make your calculations easier. Choose
the one with the smaller denominator to begin with. ■
Example 5 Calculating Combinations
Calculate a. C(11, 11)
b. C(11, 0)
Solution
a. C(11, 11) = 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 1
b. What do we do with that 0? What does it mean to multiply 0 numbers together? We
know from above that C(11, 0) = C(11, 11), so we must have C(11, 0) = 1. How
does this ﬁt with the formulas? Go back to the calculation of C(11, 11):
1 = C(11, 11) =
11!
11!(11 −11)! =
11!
11!0!
This equality is true only if we agree that 0! = 1, which we do. Then
C(11, 0) =
11!
0!11! = 1
Now for a few more complicated examples that illustrate the applications of the
counting techniques we’ve discussed.
+Before we go on... There is nothing special about 11 in the calculation in Example 5.
In general,
C(n, n) = C(n, 0) = 1
After all, there is only one way to choose n items out of n: choose them all. Similarly,
there is only one way to choose 0 items out of n: choose none of them. ■
Example 6 Lotto
In the betting game Lotto, used in many state lotteries, you choose six different numbers
in the range 1–55 (the upper number varies). The order in which you choose them is ir-
relevant. If your six numbers match the six numbers chosen in the “ofﬁcial drawing,”

Sets and Counting
+Before we go on... The calculation in Example 6 shows that you should not bother
buying all these tickets if the winning prize is less than about $14.5 million. Even if the
prize is higher, you need to account for the fact that many people will play and the prize
may end up split among several winners, not to mention the impracticality of ﬁlling out
millions of betting slips. ■
Example 7 Marbles
A bag contains 3 red marbles, 3 blue ones, 3 green ones, and 2 yellow ones (all distin-
guishable from one another).
a. How many sets of 4 marbles are possible?
b. How many sets of 4 are there such that each one is a different color?
c. How many sets of 4 are there in which at least 2 are red?
d. How many sets of 4 are there in which none are red, but at least one is green?
Solution
a. We simply need to ﬁnd the number of ways of choosing 4 marbles out of 11, which is
C(11, 4) = 330 possible sets of 4 marbles
b. We use a decision algorithm for choosing such a set of marbles.
Step 1 Choose one red one from the 3 red ones; C(3, 1) = 3 choices.
Step 2 Choose one blue one from the 3 blue ones; C(3, 1) = 3 choices.
Step 3 Choose one green one from the 3 green ones; C(3, 1) = 3 choices.
Step 4 Choose one yellow one from the 2 yellow ones; C(2, 1) = 2 choices.
This gives a total of 3 × 3 × 3 × 2 = 54 possible sets.
c. We need another decision algorithm. To say that at least 2 must be red means that
either 2 are red or 3 are red (with a total of 3 red ones). In other words, we have two
alternatives.
Alternative 1: Exactly 2 red marbles
Step 1 Choose 2 red ones; C(3, 2) = 3 choices.
Step 2 Choose 2 nonred ones. There are 8 of these, so we get C(8, 2) = 28 possible
choices.
Thus, the total number of choices for this alternative is 3 × 28 = 84.
you win the top prize. If Lotto tickets cost $1 for two sets of numbers and you decide to
buy tickets that cover every possible combination, thereby guaranteeing that you will
win the top prize, how much money will you have to spend?
Solution We ﬁrst need to know how many sets of numbers are possible. Because order
does not matter, we are asking for the number of combinations of 55 numbers taken 6 at
a time. This is
C(55, 6) = 55 × 54 × 53 × 52 × 51 × 50
6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
= 28,989,675
Because $1 buys you two of these, you need to spend 28,989,675/2 = $14,494,838
(rounding up to the nearest dollar) to be assured of a win!

6.4 Permutations and Combinations
433
+Before we go on... Here is an easier way to answer part (d) of Example 7. First, the
total number of sets having no red marbles is C(8, 4) = 70. Next, of those, the number
containing no green marbles is C(5, 4) = 5. This leaves 70 −5 = 65 sets that contain
no red marbles but having at least one green marble. (We have really used here the for-
mula for the cardinality of the complement of a set.) ■
The last example concerns poker hands. For those unfamiliar with playing cards,
here is a short description. A standard deck consists of 52 playing cards. Each card is in
one of 13 denominations: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), and King
(K), and in one of four suits: hearts (♥), diamonds (♦), clubs (♣), and spades (♠). Thus,
for instance, the Jack of spades, J♠, refers to the denomination of Jack in the suit of
spades. The entire deck of cards is thus
Alternative 2: Exactly 3 red marbles.
Step 1 Choose the 3 red ones; C(3, 3) = 1 choice.
Step 2 Choose 1 nonred one; C(8, 1) = 8 choices.
Thus, the total number of choices for this alternative is 1 × 8 = 8.
By the addition principle, we get a total of 84 + 8 = 92 sets.
d. The phrase “at least 1 green” tells us that we again have some alternatives.
Alternative 1: 1 green marble
Step 1 Choose 1 green marble from the 3; C(3, 1) = 3 choices.
Step 2 Choose 3 nongreen, nonred marbles; C(5, 3) = 10 choices.
Thus, the total number of choices for alternative 1 is 3 × 10 = 30.
Alternative 2: 2 green marbles
Step 1 Choose 2 green marbles from the 3; C(3, 2) = 3 choices.
Step 2 Choose 2 nongreen, nonred marbles; C(5, 2) = 10 choices.
Thus, the total number of choices for alternative 2 is 3 × 10 = 30.
Alternative 3: 3 green marbles
Step 1 Choose 3 green marbles from the 3; C(3, 3) = 1 choice.
Step 2 Choose 1 nongreen, nonred marble; C(5, 1) = 5 choices.
Thus, the total number of choices for alternative 3 is 1 × 5 = 5.
The addition principle now tells us that the number of sets of four marbles with none
red, but at least one green, is 30 + 30 + 5 = 65.

Solution
a. Because the order of the cards doesn’t matter, we simply need to know the number of
ways of choosing a set of 5 cards out of 52, which is
C(52, 5) = 2,598,960 hands
b. Here is a decision algorithm for choosing a full house with three 10s and two Queens.
Step 1 Choose three 10s. Because there are four 10s to choose from, we have
C(4, 3) = 4 choices.
Step 2 Choose 2 Queens; C(4, 2) = 6 choices.
Thus, there are 4 × 6 = 24 possible full houses with three 10s and two Queens.
c. Here is a decision algorithm for choosing a full house.
Step 1 Choose a denomination for the three of a kind; 13 choices.
Step 2 Choose 3 cards of that denomination. Because there are 4 cards of each
denomination (one for each suit), we get C(4, 3) = 4 choices.
Step 3 Choose a different denomination for the two of a kind. There are only 12
denominations left, so we have 12 choices.
Step 4 Choose 2 of that denomination; C(4, 2) = 6 choices.
Thus, by the multiplication principle, there are a total of 13 × 4 × 12 × 6 = 3744 pos-
sible full houses.

points are obtained by solving a system of two equations in
two unknowns obtained from two of the constraints. Thus,
you decide that it might pay instead to locate all the possible
corner points by solving all possible combinations of two
equations and then checking whether each solution is a feasi-
ble point.
a. How many systems of two equations in two unknowns
will you be required to solve?
b. Generalize this to n constraints.

20 constraints. You locate corner points as follows: Selecting
three of the constraints, you turn them into equations (by re-
placing the inequalities with equalities), solve the resulting
system of three equations in three unknowns, and then check
to see whether the solution is feasible.

Subject: Crazy Cubes
We’ve hit on an excellent idea for a new educational puzzle (which we are calling “Crazy Cubes” until
Marketing comes up with a better name). Basically, Crazy Cubes will consist of a set of plastic cubes.
Two faces of each cube will be colored red, two will be colored blue, and two white, and there will be
exactly two cubes with each possible conﬁguration of colors. The goal of the puzzle is to seek out the
matching pairs, thereby enhancing a child’s geometric intuition and three-dimensional manipulation
skills. The kit will include every possible conﬁguration of colors. We are, however, a little stumped on the
following question: How many cubes will the kit contain? In other words, how many possible ways can
one color the faces of a cube so that two faces are red, two are blue, and two are white?
Looking at the problem, you reason that the following three-step decision algorithm
ought to sufﬁce:
Step 1 Choose a pair of faces to color red; C(6, 2) = 15 choices.
Step 2 Choose a pair of faces to color blue; C(4, 2) = 6 choices.
Step 3 Choose a pair of faces to color white; C(2, 2) = 1 choice.
This algorithm appears to give a total of 15 × 6 × 1 = 90 possible cubes. However,
before sending your reply to Felix, you realize that something is wrong, because there
are different choices that result in the same cube. To describe some of these choices,
David Young-Wolff/PhotoEdit

imagine a cube oriented so that four of its faces are facing the four compass directions
(Figure 9). Consider choice 1 with the top and bottom faces blue, north and south faces
white, and east and west faces red and choice 2 with the top and bottom faces blue, north
and south faces red, and east and west faces white. These cubes are actually the same, as
you see by rotating the second cube 90 degrees (Figure 10).
You therefore decide that you need a more sophisticated decision algorithm. Here is
one that works.
Alternative 1: Faces with the same color opposite each other. Place one of the blue
faces down. Then the top face is also blue. The cube must look like the one drawn in
Figure 10. Thus there is only one choice here.
Alternative 2: Red faces opposite each other and the other colors on adjacent pairs of
faces. Again there is only one choice, as you can see by putting the red faces on the
top and bottom and then rotating.
Alternative 3: White faces opposite each other and the other colors on adjacent pairs of
faces; one possibility.
Alternative 4: Blue faces opposite each other and the other colors on adjacent pairs of
faces; one possibility.
Alternative 5: Faces with the same color adjacent to each other. Look at the cube so that
the edge common to the two red faces is facing you and horizontal (Figure 11). Then
the faces on the left and right must be of different colors because they are opposite
each other. Assume that the face on the right is white. (If it’s blue, then rotate the die
with the red edge still facing you to move it there, as in Figure 12.) This leaves two
choices for the other white face, on the upper or the lower of the two back faces. This
alternative gives 2 choices.
It follows that there are 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 choices. Because the Crazy Cubes
kit will feature two of each cube, the kit will require 12 different cubes.18

In all of the following exercises, there are three colors to choose from: red, white, and blue.

(using two of the colors red, white, and blue) with three faces one color and three an-
other. How many additional cubes will be required?
2. If Felix now suggests adding two each of cubes with two faces one color, one face
another color, and three faces the third color, how many additional cubes will be
required?
3. Felix changes his mind and suggests the kit use tetrahedral blocks with two colors in-
stead (see the ﬁgure). How many of these would be required?
4. Once Felix ﬁnds the answer to the preceding exercise, he decides to go back to the
cube idea, but this time insists that all possible combinations of up to three colors
should be included. (For instance, some cubes will be all one color, others will be two
colors.) How many cubes should the kit contain?

On the game show Let’s Make a Deal, you are shown three doors, A, B, and C, and behind
one of them is the Big Prize. After you select one of them—say, door A—to make things
more interesting the host (Monty Hall) opens one of the other doors—say, door B—revealing
that the Big Prize is not there. He then offers you the opportunity to change your selection to
the remaining door, door C. Should you switch or stick with your original guess? Does it make

Introduction
What is the probability of winning the lottery twice? What are the chances that a college
athlete whose drug test is positive for steroid use is actually using steroids? You are play-
ing poker and have been dealt two iacks. What is the likelihood that one of the next three
cards you are dealt will also be a jack? These are all questions about probability.
Understanding probability is important in many ﬁelds, ranging from risk manage-
ment in business through hypothesis testing in psychology to quantum mechanics in
physics. The goal of this chapter is to familiarize you with the basic concepts of prob-
ability theory and to give you a working knowledge that you can apply in a variety of
situations.
In the ﬁrst two sections, the emphasis is on translating real-life situations into the
language of sample spaces, events, and probability. Once we have mastered the lan-
guage of probability, we spend the rest of the chapter studying some of its theory and
applications. The last section gives an interesting application of both probability and
matrix arithmetic.
Sample Spaces and Events
Sample Spaces
At the beginning of a football game, to ensure fairness, the referee tosses a coin to de-
cide who will get the ball ﬁrst. When the ref tosses the coin and observes which side
faces up, there are two possible results: heads (H) and tails (T). These are the only pos-
sible results, ignoring the (remote) possibility that the coin lands on its edge. The act of
tossing the coin is an example of an experiment. The two possible results, H and T, are
possible outcomes of the experiment, and the set S = {H, T} of all possible outcomes is
the sample space for the experiment.

Experiments, Outcomes, and Sample Spaces
An experiment is an occurrence with a result, or outcome, that is uncertain before the
experiment takes place. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space for
the experiment.
1. Experiment: Flip a coin and observe the side facing up.
Outcomes: H, T
Sample Space: S = {H, T}
2. Experiment: Select a student in your class.
Outcomes: The students in your class
Sample Space: The set of students in your class
3. Experiment: Select a student in your class and observe the color of his or her hair.
Outcomes: red, black, brown, blond, green, . . .
Sample Space: {red, black, brown, blond, green, . . .}
4. Experiment: Cast a die and observe the number facing up.
Outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Sample Space: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Example 1 School and Work
In a survey* conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the high school graduating
class of 2003 was divided into those who went on to college and those who did not.
Those who went on to college were further divided into those who went to two-year col-
leges and those who went to four-year colleges. All graduates were also asked whether
they were working or not. Find the sample space for the experiment “Select a member
of the high school graduating class of 2003 and classify his or her subsequent school and
work activity.”

Events
Given a sample space S, an event E is a subset of S. The outcomes in E are called the
favorable outcomes. We say that E occurs in a particular experiment if the outcome of
that experiment is one of the elements of E—that is, if the outcome of the experiment is
favorable.

Let S be the sample space of Example 1. List the elements in the following events:
a. The event E that a 2003 high school graduate was working.
b. The event F that a 2003 high school graduate was not going to a two-year college.
Solution
a. We had this sample space:
S = {2-year college & working, two-year college & not working, 
4-year college & working, four-year college & not working, 
no college & working, no college & not working}
We are asked for the event that a graduate was working. Whenever we encounter a
phrase involving “the event that . . . ,” we mentally translate this into mathematical lan-
guage by changing the wording.
Replace the phrase “the event that . . . ” by the phrase “the subset of the sample
space consisting of all outcomes in which . . . ”
Thus we are interested in the subset of the sample space consisting of all outcomes in
which the graduate was working. This gives
E = {two-year college & working, four-year college & working, no college
& working}
The outcomes in E are illustrated by the shaded cells in Figure 2.

Complement, Union, and Intersection of Events
Events may often be described in terms of other events, using set operations such as
complement, union, and intersection.
quick Examples
Complement of an Event
The complement of an event E is the set of outcomes not in E. Thus, the complement of
E represents the event that E does not occur.
Visualizing the Complement

no college & working, no college & not working}
The outcomes in F are illustrated by the shaded cells in Figure 3.

Union of Events
The union of the events E and F is the set of all outcomes in E or F (or both). Thus,
E ∪F represents the event that E occurs or F occurs (or both).*
Roll a die.
E: The outcome is a 5; E = {5}
F: The outcome is an even number; F = {2, 4, 6}
E ∪F: The outcome is either a 5 or an even number; E ∪F = {2, 4, 5, 6}
* As in the preceding chapter, when we use the word or, we agree to mean one or the other or both. This is
called the inclusive or and mathematicians have agreed to take this as the meaning of or to avoid confusion.
quick Example
Intersection of Events
The intersection of the events E and F is the set of all outcomes common to E and F.
Thus, E ∩F represents the event that both E and F occur.
Roll two dice; one red and one green.
E: The red die is 2
F: The green die is odd
E ∩F: The red die is 2 and the green die is odd; E ∩F = {(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5)}

Example 5 iPods, iMacs and Powerbooks
(Compare Example 3 in Section 6.2.) The following table shows sales, in thousands of
units, of iPods®, Powerbooks®, and iMacs® in the fourth quarter of 2003 and in the third
and fourth quarters of 2004.*
Consider the experiment in which an item is selected at random from those in the table.
Let D be the event that it was an iPod, let M be the event that it was an iMac, and let A
be the event that it was sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. Describe the following events
and compute their cardinality:
a. A′
b. D ∩A
c. M ∪A′
Solution Before we answer the questions, note that S is the set of all items represented
in the table, so S has a total of 3,560,000 outcomes.
a. A′ is the event that the item was not sold in the fourth quarter of 2003. Its cardinality is
n(A′) = n(S) −n(A) = 3560 −770 = 2790 thousand items
b. D ∩A is the event that it was an iPod and was sold in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Referring to the table, we ﬁnd
n(D ∩A) = 340 thousand items
* Figures are rounded. SOURCE: Company report www.apple.com January 2005.
Solution The key here is to remember that intersection corresponds to and and union
to or.
a. R ∩P′ is the event that it will rain and it will not be pleasant.
R ∪(P ∩C) is the event that either it will rain, or it will be pleasant and cold.
b. If we rephrase the given statement using and and or we get “Tomorrow will be either
a pleasant day or a cold and rainy day, and it will not be hot.”
[P ∪(C ∩R)] ∩H′
Pleasant, or cold and rainy, and not hot.
The nuances of the English language play an important role in this formulation. For in-
stance, the effect of the pause (comma) after “rainy day” suggests placing the preceding
clause P ∪(C ∩R) in parentheses. In addition, the phrase “cold and rainy” suggests
that C and R should be grouped together in their own parentheses.

Probability
Before we go on... We could shorten the calculation in part (c) of Example 5 even further
using De Morgan’s law to write n(M ∪A′) = n((M′ ∩A)′) = 3560 −(340 + 180) =
3040 thousand items, a calculation suggested by looking at the table. ■

Mutually Exclusive Events
If E and F are events, then E and F are said to be disjoint or mutually exclusive if
E ∩F is empty. (Hence, they have no outcomes in common.)
Visualizing Mutually Exclusive Events
Interpretation
It is impossible for mutually exclusive events to occur simultaneously.
In each of the following examples, E and F are mutually exclusive events.
1. Roll a die and observe the number facing up. E: The outcome is even; F: The outcome
is odd.
E = {2, 4, 6}, F = {1, 3, 5}
2. Toss a coin three times and record the sequence of heads and tails. E: All three tosses
land the same way up, F: One toss shows heads and the other two show tails.
E = {HHH, TTT}, F = {HTT, THT, TTH}

FAQs
Specifying the Sample Space
Q: How do I determine the sample space in a given application?
A: Strictly speaking, an experiment should include a description of what kinds of objects are in
the sample space, as in:
Cast a die and observe the number facing up.
Sample space: the possible numbers facing up, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Choose a person at random and record her social security number and whether she is
blonde.
Sample space: pairs (9-digit number, Y/N).
However, in many of the scenarios discussed in this chapter and the next, an experiment is
specified more vaguely, as in “Select a student in your class.” In cases like this, the nature of
the sample space should be determined from the context. For example, if the discussion is about
grade-point averages and gender, the sample space can be taken to consist of pairs (grade-point
average, M/F). ■

7.2 Estimated and Theoretical Probability
Estimated Probability
Suppose you have a coin that you think is not fair and you would like to determine the
likelihood that heads will come up when it is tossed. You could estimate this likelihood
by tossing the coin a large number of times and counting the number of times heads
comes up. Suppose, for instance, that in 100 tosses of the coin, heads comes up 58 times.
The fraction of times that heads comes up, 58/100 = .58, is the estimated probability
or relative frequency of heads coming up when the coin is tossed. In other words, say-
ing that the estimated probability of heads coming up is .58 is the same as saying that
heads came up 58% of the time in your series of experiments.
Now let’s think about this example in terms of sample spaces and events. First of all,
there is an experiment that has been repeated N = 100 times: Toss the coin and observe
the side facing up. The sample space for this experiment is S = {H, T}. Also, there is an
event E in which we are interested: the event that heads comes up, which is E = {H}.
The number of times E has occurred, or the frequency of E, is f r(E) = 58. The esti-
mated probability of the event E is then
P(E) = f r(E)
N
= 58
100 = .58
Notes
1. The estimated probability gives us an estimate of the likelihood that heads will come
up when that particular coin is tossed.
2. The larger the number of times the experiment is performed, the more accurate an es-
timate we expect the estimated probability to be. ■

Estimated Probability
When an experiment is performed a number of times, the estimated probability or
relative frequency of an event E is the fraction of times that the event E occurs. If the
experiment is performed N times and the event E occurs f r(E) times, then the esti-
mated probability is given by
P(E) = f r(E)
N
Fraction of times E occurs.
The number f r(E) is called the frequency of E. N, the number of times that the experi-
ment is performed, is called the number of trials or the sample size. If E consists of a
single outcome s, then we refer to P(E) as the estimated probability or relative fre-
quency of the outcome s, and we write P(s).
Visualizing Estimated Probability
The collection of the estimated probabilities of all the outcomes is the estimated prob-
ability distribution or relative frequency distribution.
Note In this text, we almost always use the term estimated probability rather than
relative frequency. ■
1. Experiment: Roll a pair of dice and add the numbers that face up.
Event: E: The sum is 5.
If the experiment is repeated 100 times and E occurs on 10 of the rolls, then the es-
timated probability of E is
P(E) = f r(E)

Example 1 Sales of Light Trucks
In a survey of 75 light truck sales in 2004, 20 were found to be small SUVs, 25 were
large SUVs, 5 were small pickups, and 25 were large pickups.* What is the estimated
probability that a light truck sold in the U.S. is not a large pickup?
Solution The experiment consists of choosing a light truck sold in the U.S. and deter-
mining its type. The sample space suggested by the information given is
S = {Small SUV, Large SUV, Small Pickup, Large Pickup}
* The proportions are based on 2004 sales data. SOURCE: Environmental Protection Agency, Ward’s AutoInfoBank/

and we are interested in the event
E = {Small SUV, Large SUV, Small Pickup}
The sample size is N = 75 and the frequency of E is f r(E) = 20 + 25 + 5 = 50. Thus,
the estimated probability of E is
P(E) = f r(E)
N
= 50

+Before we go on... In Example 1, you might ask how accurate the estimate of .67 is or
how well it reﬂects all of the light trucks sold in the U.S. absent any information about
national sales ﬁgures. The ﬁeld of statistics provides the tools needed to say to what ex-
tent the estimated probability can be trusted. ■

Solution
a. The following table shows the estimated probability of each outcome, which we ﬁnd
by dividing each frequency by the sum N = 50:
b. E = {0 bids, 1–5 bids, 6–10 bids}; thus,
P(E) = f r(E)

Following are some important properties of estimated probability that we can
observe in Example 2.
Some Properties of Estimated Probability Distributions
Let S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be a sample space and let P(si) be the estimated probability of
the event {si}. Then
1. 0 ≤P(si) ≤1
2. P(s1) + P(s2) + · · · + P(sn) = 1
3. If E = {e1, e2, . . . , er}, then P(E) = P(e1) + P(e2) + · · · + P(er).
In words:
1. The estimated probability of each outcome is a number between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
2. The estimated probabilities of all the outcomes add up to 1.
3. The estimated probability of an event E is the sum of the estimated probabilities of
the individual outcomes in E.
Estimated Probability and Increasing Sample Size
A “fair” coin is one that is as likely to come up heads as it is to come up tails. In other
words, we expect heads to come up 50% of the time if we toss such a coin many times.
Put more precisely, we expect the estimated probability to approach .5 as the number of
trials gets larger. Figure 4 shows how the estimated probability behaved for one se-
quence of coin tosses. For each N we have plotted what fraction of times the coin came
up heads in the ﬁrst N tosses.

N
Notice that the estimated probability graph meanders as N increases, sometimes getting
closer to .5, and sometimes drifting away again. However, the graph tends to meander
within smaller and smaller distances of .5 as N increases.6
In general, this is how estimated probability behaves; as N gets large, the estimated
probability approaches some ﬁxed value: the theoretical probability.
Theoretical Probability
It is understandable if you are a little uncomfortable with estimated probability because
it does not always agree with what you intuitively feel to be true. For instance, if you toss
6 This can be made precise by the concept of “limit” used in calculus.

7.2 Estimated and Theoretical Probability

a fair coin 100 times and heads happen to come up 62 times, the experiment seems to
suggest that the probability of heads is .62, even though you know that the “actual” prob-
ability is .50 (because the coin is fair).
Q: So what do we mean by the “actual” probability?
A: First, some terminology: We shall refer to the “actual” probability as the theoretical prob-
ability. We can define it in two ways: one more intuitive (but not very precise) and one more
precise (but not very intuitive). ■
quick Examples
Theoretical Probability
Intuitive Deﬁnition of Theoretical Probability
The theoretical probability, or probability, P(E), of an event E is the fraction of times
we expect E to occur if we repeat the same experiment over and over.
More Precise Deﬁnition of Theoretical Probability
The theoretical probability, or probability, P(E), of an event E is the limiting value of
the estimated probability as the number of trials gets larger and larger. That is, the esti-
mated probability approaches the theoretical probability as the number of trials gets
larger and larger.* Thus,
Estimated probability is an approximation, or estimate, of theoretical probability. The
larger the number of trials, the more accurate we expect this approximation to be.
If E consists of a single outcome s, we refer to P(E) as the probability of the outcome
s, and write P(s) for P(E). The collection of the probabilities of all the outcomes is the
probability distribution.
Determining Theoretical Probability
Theoretical probability is determined analytically—that is, by using our knowledge
about the nature of the experiment rather than through actual experimentation. The best
we can obtain through actual experimentation is an estimate of the theoretical probabil-
ity (hence the term estimated probability).
1. Toss a fair coin and observe the side that faces up. Because we expect that heads is as
likely to come up as tails, we conclude that the theoretical probability distribution is
P(H) = 1
2,
P(T) = 1
2
2. Roll a fair die. Because we expect to roll a 1 one sixth of the time,
P(1) = 1
6
Similarly, P(2) = 1
6, P(3) = 1
6, . . . , P(6) = 1
6 .
3. Roll a pair of fair dice (recall that there are a total of 36 outcomes if the dice are dis-
tinguishable). If E is the event that the sum of the numbers that face up is 5, then
E = {(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)}. Because all 36 outcomes are equally likely,
P(E) = 4
36 = 1
9
* See Figure 4 in the preceding section. In calculus, the idea of a “limiting value” can be made very precise,
and we say that P(E) is the limit of the estimated probability of E as the number of trials N →+∞.

Computing Theoretical Probability: Equally Likely Outcomes
In an experiment in which all outcomes are equally likely, the theoretical probability of
an event E is given by
P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes
Total number of outcomes
= n(E)
n(S)
Visualizing Theoretical Probability with Equally Likely Outcomes
Note Remember that this formula will work only when the outcomes are equally likely.
If, for example, a die is weighted, then the outcomes may not be equally likely, and the
formula above will not apply.
1. Toss a fair coin three times. The probability that we throw exactly two heads is
P(E) = n(E)
n(S) = 3

There are 8 equally likely outcomes and E = {HHT, HTH, THH}.
2. Roll a pair of fair dice. The probability that we roll a double (both dice show the same
number) is

Notes
1. Another distinction between estimated and theoretical probability is that the esti-
mated probability of an event E is the fraction of times E actually occurs in a repeated
experiment, whereas the theoretical probability is the fraction of times we expect E to
occur in the long term.
2. We use the same letter P for theoretical probability as we used for estimated proba-
bility. Whether we are talking about estimated or theoretical probability will either be
stated or be clear from the context. In the same vein, we shall often simply speak of
“probability” in reference to either estimated or theoretical probability.
Now, how do we calculate theoretical probability “using our knowledge about the
nature of the experiment”? There is no easy way to calculate theoretical probability in
general, and sometimes there is no way at all. For instance, the probability that it will
snow in Toronto on November 1 is (we suspect) impossible to determine theoretically, so
we must rely on estimated probabilities for weather prediction. However, notice that, in
the Quick Examples above, all the outcomes were equally likely and, for an event E all
we did was compute the ratio

Example 3 Sales of Light Trucks
(Compare Example 1) Approximately 750,000 light trucks were sold in the U.S. in 2004.
Of these, 200,000 were small SUVs, 250,000 were large SUVs, 50,000 were small pick-
ups, and 250,000 were large pickups.*
a. What is the probability that a light truck sold in the U.S. in 2004 was an SUV?
b. What is the probability that a light truck sold in the U.S. in 2004 was not a large pickup?
Solution
a. The experiment suggested by the question consists of randomly choosing a light truck
sold in the U.S. and determining its type. We are interested in the event E that the light
truck was an SUV. So,
S = the set of light trucks sold in the U.S. in 2004; n(S) = 750,000.
E = the set of SUVs sold in the U.S. in 2004; n(E) = 200,000 +
250,000 = 450,000.
Are the outcomes equally likely in this experiment? Yes, because we are as likely to
choose one light truck as another. Thus,
P(E) = n(E)
n(S) = 450,000
750,000 = .6
b. Let the event F consist of those light trucks sold in 2004 that were not large pickups.
n(F) = 750,000 −250,000 = 500,000
Hence,
P(F) = n(F)
n(S) = 500,000
750,000 ≈.67

AutoInfoBank/The New York Times, February 8, 2005, p. C1.
Q: In Example 1 we had a similar example about trucks, but we called the probabilities
calculated there estimated. Here they are theoretical. What is the difference?
A: In Example 1, the data were based on the results of a survey, or sample, of only 75 light
trucks (out of a total of about 750,000 sold in the U.S.), and were therefore incomplete. 
(A statistician would say that we were given sample statistics.) It follows that any inference
we draw from the 75 surveyed, such as the probability that a light truck sold in the U.S. is not a
large pickup, is uncertain, and this is the cue that tells us that we are working with estimated
probability. Think of the survey as an experiment (for instance, select a graduating senior)
repeated 75 times—exactly the setting for estimated probability.

In Example 3 above, on the other hand, the data do not describe how some light truck sales
are broken down into the categories described, but they describe how all 750,000 light truck
sales in the U.S. are broken down. (The statistician would say that we were given population
statistics in this case, because the data describe the entire “population” of light trucks sold in
the U.S. in 2004.) ■
Example 4 iPods, iMacs and Powerbooks
(Compare Example 5 in Section 7.1.) The following table shows sales, in thousands of
units, of iPods®, Powerbooks®, and iMacs® in the fourth quarter of 2003 and in the third
and fourth quarters of 2004.*
If one of the items is selected at random, ﬁnd the (theoretical) probabilities of the fol-
lowing events:
a. It is an iPod.
b. It was sold in the third quarter of 2004.
c. It is an iPod sold in the third quarter of 2004.
d. It is either an iPod or was sold in the third quarter of 2004.
e. It is not an iPod.
Solution
a. The sample space S is the set of all these machines, and the outcomes consist of all
the items sold in the given quarters. Because an item is being selected at random,
all the outcomes are equally likely. If D is the event that the selected item is an iPod,
then
P(D) = n(D)

Chapter 7
Probability
Before we go on... How are the probabilities P(D) and P(D′) in Example 4 related?
Notice that they add to 1. We shall explore this, and general facts about probability, in
Section 7.3. ■
We saw that estimated probability has the following properties for a sample space
S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}:
a. 0 ≤P(si) ≤1
b. P(s1) + P(s2) + · · · + P(sn) = 1
c. We can obtain the probability of an event E by adding up the probabilities of the out-
comes in E.
These properties hold for theoretical probability as well. Because the probability of an
outcome is the fraction of times we expect it to occur, probabilities are always numbers
between 0 and 1, inclusive. To get the fraction of times an event will occur, we clearly
need to add the fractions of times each outcome in the event will occur. And, because the
event E = S must occur every time, P(S) = P(s1) + · · · + P(sn) = 1.
Example 5 Indistinguishable Dice
We recall from Section 7.1 that the sample space when we roll a pair of indistinguish-
able dice is
S =



(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),

(5, 5), (5, 6),
(6, 6)



Compute the probabilities of all the outcomes.
Solution Because there are 21 outcomes, it is tempting to say that the probability of each
outcome is 1/21. However, the outcomes are not all equally likely. For instance, the out-
come (2, 3) is twice as likely as (2, 2), because (2, 3) can occur in two ways (it corresponds
to the event {(2, 3), (3, 2)} for distinguishable dice). For purposes of calculating probabil-
ity, it is easiest to use calculations for distinguishable dice.* Here are some examples.
* Note that any pair of real dice can be distinguished in principle because they possess slight differences, al-
though we may regard them as indistinguishable by not attempting to distinguish them. Thus, the probabilities
of events must be the same as for the corresponding events for distinguishable dice.

Example 6 Weighted Dice
In order to impress your friends with your die-rolling skills, you have surreptitiously
weighted your die in such a way that 6 is three times as likely to come up as any one of
the other numbers. (All the other outcomes are equally likely.) Find the probability dis-
tribution for a roll of the die and use it to calculate the probability of an even number
coming up.
Solution Let us label our unknowns (there appear to be two of them):
x = probability of rolling a 6.
y = probability of rolling any one of the other numbers.
We are ﬁrst told that “6 is three times as likely to come up as any other number.” If we
rephrase this in terms of our unknown probabilities we get, “the probability of rolling a
6 is three times the probability of rolling any other number.” In symbols,
x = 3y
We must also use a piece of information not given to us, but one we know must be true:
The sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1:
x + y + y + y + y + y = 1
or
x + 5y = 1
We now have two linear equations in two unknowns, and we solve for x and y. Substi-
tuting the ﬁrst equation (x = 3y) in the second (x + 5y = 1) gives
8y = 1
or
y = 1
8
To get x, we substitute the value of y back into either equation and ﬁnd
x = 3
8
Thus, the probability distribution is the one shown in the following table.

We can use the distribution to calculate the probability of an even number coming up by
adding the probabilities of the favorable outcomes.
P({2, 4, 6}) = 1
8 + 1
8 + 3
8 = 5
8
Thus there is a 5/8 = .625 chance that an even number will come up.

Q: How do I know whether a given probability is estimated or theoretical?
A: Ask yourself this: Has the probability been arrived at experimentally, by performing a
number of trials and counting the number of times the event occurred? If so, the probability is
estimated. If, on the other hand, the probability was computed by analyzing the experiment
under consideration rather than by performing actual trials of the experiment, it is theoretical. ■
Q: Out of every 100 homes, 22 have broadband Internet service. Thus, the probability that a
house has broadband service is .22. Is this probability estimated or theoretical?
A: That depends on how the ratio 22 out of 100 was arrived at. If it is based on a poll of all
homes, then the probability is theoretical. If it is based on a survey of only a sample of homes, it
is estimated (see the Q/A following Example 3). ■

found 58% to be contaminated with Campylobacter, and 84%
of those to be resistant to antibiotics.17 Construct an estimated
probability distribution showing the following outcomes

57. Organic Produce A 2001 Agriculture Department study of
more than 94,000 samples from more than 20 crops showed
that 73% of conventionally grown foods had residues from at
least one pesticide. Moreover, conventionally grown foods
were six times as likely to contain multiple pesticides as or-
ganic foods. Of the organic foods tested, 23% had pesticide
residues, which includes 10% with multiple pesticide
residues.18 Compute two probability distributions: one for
conventional produce and one for organic produce, showing
the estimated probabilities that a randomly selected product
has no pesticide residues, has residues from a single pesticide,
and has residues from multiple pesticides.
58. Organic Produce Repeat Exercise 57 using the following in-
formation for produce from California: 31% of conventional
food and 6.5% of organic food had residues from at least one
pesticide. Assume that, as in Exercise 57, conventionally
grown foods were six times as likely to contain multiple pes-
ticides as organic foods. Also assume that 3% of the organic
food has residues from multiple pesticides.
59. Steroids Testing A pharmaceutical company is running trials

known not to be using steroids. Of those using steroids, the
new test is positive for 390 and negative for 10. Of those not
using steroids, the test is positive for 10 and negative for 190.

sult (the probability that an athlete not using steroids will test
positive)?

Properties of Probability Distributions
Estimated and theoretical probability can be thought of as two different ways, appropriate
in different situations, to ﬁnd a probability distribution, an assignment of probabilities to
all the outcomes in a sample space. We record the common properties of probability
distributions.
Probability Distribution
A (ﬁnite) probability distribution is an assignment of a number P(si), the probability
of si, to each outcome of a ﬁnite sample space S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}. The probabilities
must satisfy
1. 0 ≤P(si) ≤1
and
2. P(s1) + P(s2) + · · · + P(sn) = 1.

quick Examples
We ﬁnd the probability of an event E, written P(E), by adding up the probabilities of the
outcomes in E. 
If P(E) = 0, we call E an impossible event. The event ∅is always impossible, since
something must happen.
1. All the examples of estimated and theoretical probability distributions we have
considered are examples of probability distributions.
2. Let us take S = {H, T} and make the assignments P(H) = .2, P(T) = .8. Because
these numbers are between 0 and 1 and add to 1, they specify a probability distribution.
3. With S = {H, T} again, we could also take P(H) = 1, P(T) = 0, so that T is an
impossible event.
4. The following table gives a probability distribution for the sample space 
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
It follows that
P({1, 6}) = .3 + .1 = .4
P({2, 3}) = .3 + 0 = .3
P(3) = 0
An impossible event
The distribution in Quick Example 4 could be the probability distribution of a
weighted die. Whether or not a die with these exact (theoretical) probabilities for
outcomes can actually be manufactured is a question we leave for die engineers to
ponder. As mathematicians, we can certainly conceive of such a die, and that is all the
justiﬁcation we need to consider its probability distribution. By studying probability
distributions in the abstract, without regard for how they originate, we can ﬁnd proper-
ties that all distributions must satisfy, whether estimated or theoretical.
The Probability of the Union of Two Events
For example, so far, all we know about computing the probability of an event E is that
P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of the individual outcomes in E. Suppose, though,
that we do not know the probabilities of the individual outcomes in E but we do know
that E = A ∪B, where we happen to know P(A) and P(B). How do we compute the
probability of A ∪B? We might be tempted to say that P(A ∪B) is P(A) + P(B), but let
us look at an example using the probability distribution in Quick Example 4. For A let
us take the event {2, 4, 5}, and for B let us take {2, 4, 6}. A ∪B is then the event {2, 4,
5, 6}. We know that we can ﬁnd the probabilities P(A), P(B), and P(A ∪B) by adding
the probabilities of all the outcomes in these events, so
P(A) = P({2, 4, 5}) = .3 + .1 + .2 = .6
P(B) = P({2, 4, 6}) = .3 + .1 + .1 = .5, and
P(A ∪B) = P({2, 4, 5, 6}) = .3 + .1 + .2 + .1 = .7

7.3 Properties of Probability Distributions

Addition Principle
If A and B are any two events, then
P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B)
Visualizing the Addition Principle
In the ﬁgure, the area of the union is obtained by adding the areas of A and B and then
subtracting the overlap (because it is counted twice when we add the areas).
Addition Principle for Mutually Exclusive Events
If A ∩B = ∅, we say that A and B are mutually exclusive, and we have
P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B)
Because P(A ∩B) = 0
P(A)
P(B)
A
B
P(AB)
P(AB)  P(A)  P(B)  P(AB)
Our ﬁrst guess was wrong: P(A ∪B) ̸= P(A) + P(B). Notice, however, that the out-
comes in A ∩B are counted twice in computing P(A) + P(B), but only once in comput-
ing P(A ∪B):
P(A) + P(B) = P({2, 4, 5}) + P({2, 4, 6})
A ∩B = {2, 4}
= (.3 + .1 + .2) + (.3 + .1 + .1)
P(A ∩B) counted twice
= 1.1
whereas
P(A ∪B) = P({2, 4, 5, 6}) = .3 + .1 + .2 + .1
P(A ∩B) counted once
= .7
Thus, if we take P(A) + P(B) and then subtract the surplus P(A ∩B), we get P(A ∪B).
In symbols,
P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B)
.7 = .6 + .5 −.4
(See Figure 5.) We call this formula the addition principle. One more thing: Notice that
our original guess P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) would have worked if we had chosen A
and B with no outcomes in common; that is, if A ∩B = ∅. When A ∩B = ∅, recall that
we say that A and B are mutually exclusive.

Visualizing the Addition Principle for Mutually Exclusive Events
If A and B do not overlap, then the area of the union is obtained by adding the areas of
A and B.
This holds true also for more than two events: If A1, A2, . . . , An are mutually exclusive
events (that is, the intersection of every pair of them is empty), then
P(A1 ∪A2 ∪. . . ∪An) = P(A1) + P(A2) + · · · + P(An)
1. There is a 10% chance of rain (R) tomorrow, a 20% chance of high winds (W), and a
5% chance of both. The probability of either rain or high winds (or both) is
P(R ∪W) = P(R) + P(W) −P(R ∩W)
= .10 + .20 −.05 = .25
2. The probability that you will be in Cairo at 6 A.M. tomorrow (C) is .3, while the prob-
ability that you will be in Alexandria at 6 A.M tomorrow (A) is .2. Thus, the probabil-
ity that you will be either in Cairo or Alexandria at 6 A.M. tomorrow is
P(C ∪A) = P(C) + P(A)
A and C are mutually exclusive.
= .3 + .2 = .5
3. When a pair of fair dice is rolled, the probability of the numbers that face up adding
to 7 is 6/36, the probability of their adding to 8 is 5/36, and the probability of their
adding to 9 is 4/36. Thus, the probability of the numbers adding to 7, 8, or 9 is
P(7 ∪8 ∪9) = P(7) + P(8) + P(9)
= 6

You can use the formula
P(A   B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A   B)
to calculate any of the 4 quanti-
ties in the formula if you know
the other 3.
We can use the addition principle to deduce other useful properties of a probability
distribution.
Solution We can think of the experiment of choosing a member of the high school
graduating class of 2003 at random. The sample space is the set of all these graduates.
a. We are given information about two events:
A: A graduate went on to college; P(A) = .64
B: A graduate went on to work; P(B) = .55
We are also told that P(A ∪B) = .92. We are asked for the probability that a gradu-
ate went on to both college and work, P(A ∩B). To ﬁnd P(A ∩B), we take advan-
tage of the fact that the formula
P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B)
can be used to calculate any one of the four quantities that appear in it as long as we
know the other three. Substituting the quantities we know, we get
.92 = .64 + .55 −P(A ∩B)
so
P(A ∩B) = .64 + .55 −.92 = .27
Thus, 27% of the graduates went on to college and work at the same time.
b. We are asked for the probability of a new event:
C: A graduate went on to college but not work.
C is the part of A outside of A ∩B, so C ∪(A ∩B) = A, and C and A ∩B are mu-
tually exclusive. (See Figure 6.)
Thus, applying the addition principle, we have
P(C) + P(A ∩B) = P(A)
From part (a), we know that P(A ∩B) = .27, so
P(C) + .27 = .64
giving
P(C) = .37
In other words, 37% of the graduates went on to college but not work.
The probability of something happening is 1.
The probability of nothing happening is 0.
The probability of A not happening is 1 minus the probability of A.
More Principles of Probability Distributions
The following rules hold for any sample space S and any event A:
P(S) = 1
P(∅) = 0
P(A′) = 1 −P(A)
Note
We can also write the third equation as
P(A) = 1 −P(A′)

478
Chapter 7
Probability
Q: Can you persuade me that all of these principles are true?
A: Let us take them one at a time. ■
We know that S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} is the set of all outcomes, and so
P(S) = P({s1, s2, . . . , sn})
= P(s1) + P(s2) + · · · + P(sn)
= 1
Now, note that S ∩∅= ∅, so that S and ∅are mutually exclusive. Applying the ad-
dition principle gives
P(S) = P(S ∪∅) = P(S) + P(∅)
Subtracting P(S) from both sides gives 0 = P(∅).
If A is any event in S, then we can write
S = A ∪A′
where A and A′ are mutually exclusive. (Why?) Thus, by the addition principle,
P(S) = P(A) + P(A′)
Because P(S) = 1, we get
1 = P(A) + P(A′)
or
P(A′) = 1 −P(A)
* SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics press release, January 4, 2002, obtained from www.bls.gov.
We add the probabilities of the outcomes to
obtain the probability of an event.
By the deﬁnition of a probability distribution
or
P(A) + P(A′) = 1
Visualizing the Rule for Complements
Think of A′ as the portion of S outside of A. Adding the two areas gives the area of all
of S, equal to 1.
1. There is a 10% chance of rain (R) tomorrow. Therefore, the probability that it will not
rain is
P(R′) = 1 −P(R) = 1 −.10 = .90
2. The probability that Eric Ewing will score at least two goals is .6. Therefore, the prob-
ability that he will score at most one goal is 1 −.6 = .4.

working age was unemployed but actively searching for a job was approximately .05.
Calculate the probabilities of the following events.
a. A resident of working age was unemployed.
b. A resident was unemployed and not actively searching for a job.
Solution
a. Let us write E for the event that a resident (of working age) was employed. We are
given that P(E) = .62. The event that the resident was unemployed is the comple-
ment of E, and its probability is given by
P(E′) = 1 −P(E) = 1 −.62 = .38
b. We are given the probability that a resident was unemployed and searching for a job,
and are asked to ﬁnd the probability that a resident was unemployed and not search-
ing for a job. The two corresponding events
J: A resident was unemployed and searching for a job; P(J) = .05
N: A resident was unemployed and not searching for a job
are mutually exclusive events whose union is E′, the set of all unemployed residents.
Hence,
P(E′) = P(N) + P(J)
.38 = P(N) + .05
giving
P(N) = .38 −.05 = .33
Thus, there was a 33% chance that a U.S. resident of working age was unemployed
and not searching for a job.
The next example is identical to Example 4 in Section 7.2. What is different is the
way in which we calculate some of the answers.

If one of the items is selected at random, ﬁnd the probabilities of the following
events:
a. It is an iPod.
b. It was sold in the third quarter of 2004.
c. It is an iPod sold in the third quarter of 2004.
d. It is either an iPod or was sold in the third quarter of 2004.
e. It is not an iPod.
Solution The answers to parts (a), (b), and (c) are calculated exactly as in Example 4
in Section 7.2.
a. If D is the event that the selected item is an iPod, then
P(D) = n(D)
n(S) = 2230
3560 ≈.626
b. If A is the event that the selected item was sold in the third quarter of 2004, then
P(A) = n(A)
n(S) = 1320
3560 ≈.371
c. The event that the selected item is an iPod sold in the third quarter of 2004 is the event
D ∩A, and
P(D ∩A) = n(D ∩A)
n(S)
= 860
3560 ≈.242
d. The event that the selected item is either an iPod or was sold in the third quarter of
2004 is the event D ∪A, and may be computed using the formula for the probability
of the union:
P(D ∪A) = P(D) + P(A) −P(D ∩A)
≈.626 + .371 −.242 = .755
(A more precise answer is .756. The last decimal place in the above computation is off
due to the fact that we rounded P(D), P(A), and P(D ∩A).)
e. The event that the selected item is not an iPod is the event D′; its probability may be
computed using the formula for the probability of the complement:
P(D′) = 1 −P(D) ≈1 −.626 = .374

9. ● P(A) = .75. Find P(A′).
10. ● P(A) = .22. Find P(A′).

Probability and Counting Techniques
(OPTIONAL)
We saw in the preceding section that, when all outcomes in a sample space are equally
likely, we can use the following formula.
Computing Theoretical Probability: Equally Likely Outcomes
In an experiment in which all outcomes are equally likely, the theoretical probability of
an event E is given by
P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes
Total number of outcomes
= n(E)
n(S)
This formula is simple, but calculating n(E) and n(S) may not be. In this section,
we look at some examples in which we need to use the counting techniques discussed in
the preceding chapter.
Example 1 Marbles
A bag contains 4 red marbles and 2 green ones. Upon seeing the bag, Suzy (who has
compulsive marble-grabbing tendencies) sticks her hand in and grabs 3 at random. Find
the probability that she will get both green marbles.
Solution
According to the formula, we need to know these numbers:
• The number of elements in the sample space S.
• The number of elements in the event E.
First of all, what is the sample space? The sample space is the set of all possible out-
comes, and each outcome consists of a set of 3 marbles (in Suzy’s hand). So, the set of
outcomes is the set of all sets of 3 marbles chosen from a total of 6 marbles (4 red and
2 green). Thus,
n(S) = C(6, 3) = 20
Now what about E? This is the event that Suzy gets both green marbles. We must
rephrase this as a subset of S in order to deal with it: “E is the collection of sets of three
marbles such that one is red and two are green.” Thus, n(E) is the number of such sets,
which we determine using a decision algorithm.
Step 1 Choose a red marble; C(4, 1) = 4 possible outcomes.
Step 2 Choose the two green marbles; C(2, 2) = 1 possible outcome.
We get n(E) = 4 × 1 = 4. Now,
P(E) = n(E)
n(S) = 4
20 = 1
5
Thus, there is a one in ﬁve chance of Suzy’s getting both the green marbles.
S is the set of all outcomes
that can occur, and has nothing
to do with having green marbles.

Find the probabilities of the following events:
a. Your portfolio included ELN and NOK.
b. At most two of the stocks in your portfolio declined in value.
Solution First, the sample space is the set of all collections of 3 stocks chosen from
the 6. Thus,
n(S) = C(6, 3) = 20
a. The event E of interest is the event that your portfolio includes ELN and TTN. Thus,
E is the set of all groups of 3 stocks that include ELN and TTN. Because there is only
one more stock left to choose,
n(E) = C(4, 1) = 4
We now have
P(E) = n(E)
n(S) = 4
20 = 1
5 = .2
b. Let F be the event that at most two of the stocks in your portfolio declined in value.
Thus, F is the set of all portfolios of three stocks of which at most two declined in
value. To calculate n(F), we use the following decision algorithm, noting that three
of the stocks declined in value and three did not.
Alternative 1: None of the stocks declined in value.
Step 1 Choose three stocks that did not decline in value; C(3, 3) = 1 possibility.
Alternative 2: One of the stocks declined in value.
Step 1 Choose one stock that declined in value; C(3, 1) = 3 possibilities.
Step 2 Choose two stocks that did not decline in value; C(3, 2) = 3 possibilities.
This gives 3 × 3 = 9 possibilities for this alternative.
Alternative 3: Two of the stocks declined in value.
Step 1 Choose two stocks that declined in value; C(3, 2) = 3 possibilities.
Step 2 Choose one stock that did not decline in value; C(3, 1) = 3 possibilities.
This gives 3 × 3 = 9 possibilities for this alternative.

7.4 Probability and Counting Techniques (OPTIONAL)
485
So, we have a total of 1 + 9 + 9 = 19 possible portfolios. Thus,
n(F) = 19
and
P(F) = n(F)
n(S) = 19
20 = .95
+Before we go on... When counting the number of outcomes in an event, the calculation
is sometimes easier if we look at the complement of that event. In the case of part (b) of
the Example 2, the complement of the event F is
F′: At least three of the stocks in your portfolio declined in value.
Because there are only three stocks in your portfolio, this is the same as the event that
all three stocks in your portfolio declined in value. The decision algorithm for n(F′) is
far simpler:
Step 1 Choose 3 stocks that declined in value: C(3, 3) = 1 possibility.
So, n(F′) = 1, giving
n(F) = n(S) −n(F′) = 20 −1 = 19
as we calculated above. ■
Example 3 Poker Hands
You are dealt 5 cards from a well-shufﬂed standard deck of 52. Find the probability that
you have a full house. (Recall that a full house consists of 3 cards of one denomination
and 2 of another.)
Solution The sample space S is the set of all possible 5-card hands dealt from a deck
of 52. Thus,
n(S) = C(52, 5) = 2,598,960
If the deck is thoroughly shufﬂed, then each of these 5-card hands is equally likely. Now
consider the event E, the set of all possible 5-card hands that constitute a full house. To
calculate n(E), we use a decision algorithm, which we show in the following compact
form.
1. Choose ﬁrst denomination
2. Choose 3 cards of that denomination
3. Choose second denomination
4. Choose 2 cards of that denomination
n(E) = C(13, 1) × C(4, 3) × C(12, 1) × C(4, 2) = 3744
Thus,
P(E) = n(E)
n(S) =
3744
2,598,960 ≈.00144
In other words, there is an approximately 0.144% chance that you will be dealt a full
house.
At most 2 of the
stocks declined in
value.
At least 3 of the

value.

Example 4 More Poker Hands
You are playing poker, and you have been dealt the following hand:
J♠, J♦, J♥, 2♣, 10♠
You decide to exchange the last two cards. The exchange works as follows: The two
cards are discarded (not replaced in the deck) and you are dealt two new cards.
a. Find the probability that you end up with a full house.
b. Find the probability that you end up with four jacks.
c. What is the probability that you end up with either a full house or four jacks?
Solution
a. In order to get a full house, you must be dealt two of a kind. The sample space S is the
set of all pairs of cards selected from what remains of the original deck of 52. You
were dealt 5 cards originally, so there are 52 −5 = 47 cards left in the deck. Thus,
n(S) = C(47, 2) = 1081. The event E is the set of all pairs of cards that constitute
two of a kind. Note that you cannot get two jacks because only one is left in the deck.
Also, only three 2s and three 10s are left in the deck. We have
1. Choose a denomination
1. Choose either 2’s or 10’s
other than Jacks, 2’s and 10’s
OR
n(E) = C(10, 1) × C(4, 2)

1. Choose the jack of Clubs
2. Choose 1 card from the remaining 46
n(F) = C(1, 1) × C(46, 1) = 46
Thus,
P(F) = n(F)
n(S) =
46
1081 ≈.0426
c. We are asked to calculate the probability of the event E ∪F. From the addition prin-
ciple, we have
P(E ∪F) = P(E) + P(F) −P(E ∩F)
Because E ∩F means “E and F,” E ∩F is the event that the pair of cards you are
dealt are two of a kind and include the Jack of clubs. But this is impossible because

1. Choose yourself
2. Choose 3 from the remaining 13
n(E) = C(1, 1) × C(13, 3) = 286
only one jack is left. Thus E ∩F = ∅, and so P(E ∩F) = 0. This gives us
P(E ∪F) = P(E) + P(F) ≈.0611 + .0426 = .1037
In other words, there is slightly better than a one in ten chance that you will wind up
with either a full house or four of a kind, given the original hand.
+Before we go on... A more accurate answer to part (c) of Example 4 is (66 + 46)/1081 ≈
.1036; we lost some accuracy in rounding the answers to parts (a) and (b). ■
Example 5 Committees
The University Senate bylaws at Hofstra University* state the following:
The Student Affairs Committee shall consist of one elected faculty senator, one
faculty senator-at-large, one elected student senator, ﬁve student senators-at-large
(including one from the graduate school), two delegates from the Student
Government Association, and the president of the Student Government Associa-
tion or his/her designate. It shall be chaired by the elected student senator on the
Committee and it shall be advised by the Dean of Students or his/her designate.
You are an undergraduate student and, even though you are not an elected student sena-
tor, you would very much like to serve on the Student Affairs Committee. The senators-
at-large as well as the Student Government delegates are chosen by means of a random
drawing from a list of candidates. There are already 13 undergraduate candidates for the
position of senator-at-large, and 6 candidates for Student Government delegates, and
you have been offered a position on the Student Government Association by the chair-
person (who happens to be a good friend of yours), should you wish to join it. (This
would make you ineligible for a senator-at-large position.) What should you do?
Solution You have two options. Option 1 is to include your name on the list of candi-
dates for the senator-at-large position. Option 2 is to join the Student Government As-
sociation (SGA) and add your name to its list of candidates. Let us look at the two op-
tions separately.
Option 1:Add your name to the senator-at-large list.
This will result in a list of 14 undergraduates for 4 undergraduate positions. The sample
space is the set of all possible outcomes of the random drawing. Each outcome consists
of a set of 4 lucky students chosen from 14. Thus,
n(S) = C(14, 4) = 1001
We are interested in the probability that you are among the chosen four. Thus, E is the
set of sets of 4 that include you.

In other words, the probability of being selected is exactly the same for Option 1 as it is

35 Even if all the teams are equally likely to win each game, the chances
of a perfect progression actually coming up are a little more difﬁcult to
estimate, because the number of wins by one team impacts directly on the
number of wins by the others. For instance, it is impossible for all eight
teams to show a score of 7 wins and 0 losses at the end of the season—
someone must lose! It is, however, not too hard to come up with a count-
ing argument to estimate the total number of win-lose scores actually

there are 4 possibilities—(red, red), (blue, blue), (red, blue)

Conditional Probability and Independence
Cyber Video Games, Inc., ran a television ad in advance of the release of its latest game,
“Ultimate Hockey.” As Cyber Video’s director of marketing, you would like to assess the
ad’s effectiveness, so you ask your market research team to survey video game players.
The results of its survey of 2000 video game players are summarized in the following
table:
Saw Ad
Did Not See Ad
Total
Purchased Game
100
200
300
Did Not Purchase Game
200
1500
1700
Total
300
1700
2000

The market research team concludes in its report that the ad is highly persuasive, and
recommends using the company that produced the ad for future projects.
But wait, how could the ad possibly have been persuasive? Only 100 people who
saw the ad purchased the game, while 200 people purchased the game without seeing
the ad at all! At ﬁrst glance, it looks as though potential customers are being put off by
the ad. However, let us analyze the ﬁgures a little more carefully.
First, let us restrict attention to those players who saw the ad (ﬁrst column of data:
“Saw Ad”) and compute the estimated probability that a player who saw the ad pur-
chased Ultimate Hockey.
492
Chapter 7
Probability
Saw Ad
Purchased Game
100
Did Not Purchase Game
200
Total
300
To compute this probability, we calculate
Probability that someone who saw the ad purchased the game
= Number of people who saw the ad and bought the game
Total number of people who saw the ad
= 100
300 ≈.33
In other words, 33% of game players who saw the ad went ahead and purchased the
game. Let us compare this with the corresponding probability for those players who did
not see the ad (second column of data “Did Not See Ad”):
Did Not See Ad
Purchased Game
200
Did Not Purchase Game
1500
Total
1700
Probability that someone who did not see the ad purchased the game
= Number of people who did not see the ad and bought the game
Total number of people who did not see the ad
= 200
1700 ≈.12
In other words, only 12% of game players who did not see the ad purchased the game,
whereas 33% of those who did see the ad purchased the game. Thus, it appears that the
ad was highly persuasive.
Here’s some terminology. In this example there were two related events of impor-
tance:
A: A video game player purchased Ultimate Hockey
B: A video game player saw the ad
The ﬁrst probability we computed was the estimated probability that a video game
player purchased Ultimate Hockey given that he or she saw the ad. We call the latter
probability the (estimated) probability of A, given B, and we write it as P(A | B). We
call P(A | B) a conditional probability—it is the probability of A under the condition

that B occurred. Put another way, it is the probability of A occurring if the sample space
is reduced to just those outcomes in B.
P(Purchased Game Given That Saw the Ad) = P(A | B) ≈.33
The second probability we computed was the estimated probability that a video game
player purchased Ultimate Hockey given that he or she did not see the ad, or the proba-
bility of A, given B′.
P(Purchased Game Given That Did Not See the Ad) = P(A | B′) ≈.12
Calculating Conditional Probabilities
How do we calculate conditional probabilities? In the example above we used the ratio
P(A | B) = Number of people who saw the ad and bought the game
Total number of people who saw the ad
The numerator is the frequency of A ∩B, and the denominator is the frequency of B:
P(A | B) = f r(A ∩B)
f r(B)
Now, we can write this formula in another way:
P(A | B) = f r(A ∩B)
f r(B)
= f r(A ∩B)/N
f r(B)/N
= P(A ∩B)
P(B)
We therefore have the following deﬁnition, which applies to general probability
distributions.
7.5 Conditional Probability and Independence
493
Conditional Probability
If A and B are events with P(B) ̸= 0, then the probability of A given B is
P(A | B) = P(A ∩B)

Q: Returning to the video game sales survey, how do we compute the ordinary probability of A,
not “given” anything?
A: We look at the event A that a randomly chosen game player purchased Ultimate Hockey
regardless of whether or not he or she saw the ad. In the “Purchased Game” row we see that a
total of 300 people purchased the game out of a total of 2000 surveyed. Thus, the (estimated)
probability of A is
P(A) = f r(A)
N
= 300
2000 = .15
We sometimes refer to P(A) as the unconditional probability of A to distinguish it from condi-
tional probabilities like P(A | B) and P(A | B′). ■

Chapter 7
Probability
quick Examples 1. If there is a 50% chance of rain (R) and a 10% chance of both rain and lightning (L),
then the probability of lightning, given that it rains, is
P(L | R) = P(L ∩R)
P(R)
= .10
.50 = .20
Here are two more ways to express the result:
• If it rains, the probability of lightning is .20.
• Assuming that it rains, there is a 20% chance of lightning.
2. Referring to the Cyber Video data above, the probability that a video game player did
not purchase the game (A′), given that she did not see the ad (B′), is
P(A′ | B′) = P(A′ ∩B′)
P(B′)
= 1500/2000
1700/2000 = 15
17 ≈.88
Example 1 Dice
If you roll a fair die twice and observe the numbers that face up, ﬁnd the probability that
the sum of the numbers is 8, given that the ﬁrst number is 3.
Solution We begin by recalling that the sample space when we roll a fair die twice is the
set S = {(1, 1), (1, 2), . . . , (6, 6)} containing the 36 different equally likely outcomes.
The two events under consideration are
A: The sum of the numbers is 8.
B: The ﬁrst number is 3.
We also need
A ∩B: The sum of the numbers is 8 and the ﬁrst number is 3.
But this can only happen in one way: A ∩B = {(3, 5)}. From the formula, then,
P(A | B) = P(A ∩B)
P(B)
= 1/36
6/36 = 1
6
Now, let’s see some more examples involving conditional probabilities.

Notes
1. Remember that, in the expression P(A | B), A is the event whose probability you
want, given that you know the event B has occurred.
2. From the formula, notice that P(A | B) is not deﬁned if P(B) = 0. Could P(A | B)
make any sense if the event B were impossible? ■
7.5 Conditional Probability and Independence
495
+Before we go on… There is another way to think about Example 1. When we say that
the first number is 3, we are restricting the sample space to the six outcomes (3, 1),
(3, 2), . . . , (3, 6), all still equally likely. Of these six, only one has a sum of 8, so the
probability of the sum being 8, given that the ﬁrst number is 3, is 1/6. ■
Example 2 School and Work
A survey* of the high school graduating class of 2003, conducted by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, found that, if a graduate went on to college, there was a 42% chance
that he or she would work at the same time. On the other hand, there was a 64% chance
that a randomly selected graduate would go on to college. What is the probability that a
graduate went to college and work at the same time?
Solution To understand what the question asks and what information is given, it is
helpful to rephrase everything using the standard wording “the probability that ___ ”
and “the probability that ___ given that ___.” Now we have, “The probability that a
graduate worked, given that the graduate went on to college, equals .42. (See Figure 7.)
The probability that a graduate went on to college is .64.” The events in question are as
follows:
W: A high school graduate went on to work
C: A high school graduate went on to college
From our rephrasing of the question we can write:
P(W | C) = .42.
P(C) = .64.
Find P(W ∩C)
The deﬁnition
P(W | C) = P(W ∩C)
P(C)
can be used to ﬁnd P(W ∩C):
P(W ∩C) = P(W | C)P(C)
= (.42)(.64) ≈.27
Thus there is a 27% chance that a member of the high school graduating class of 2003
went on to college and work at the same time.

The Multiplication Principle and Trees
In Example 2, we saw that the formula
P(A | B) = P(A ∩B)
P(B)
can be used to calculate P(A ∩B) if we rewrite the formula in the following form,
known as the multiplication principle for conditional probability:
496
Chapter 7
Probability
quick Example
Multiplication Principle for Conditional Probability
If A and B are events, then
P(A ∩B) = P(A | B)P(B)
If there is a 50% chance of rain (R) and a 20% chance of a lightning (L) if it rains, then
the probability of both rain and lightning is
P(R ∩L) = P(L | R)P(R) = (.20)(.50) = .10
The multiplication principle is often used in conjunction with tree diagrams. Let’s
return to Cyber Video Games, Inc., and its television ad campaign. Its marketing survey
was concerned with the following events:
A: A video game player purchased Ultimate Hockey
B: A video game player saw the ad
We can illustrate the various possibilities by means of the two-stage “tree” shown in
Figure 8.

Consider the outcome A ∩B. To get there from the starting position on the left, we must
ﬁrst travel up to the B node. (In other words, B must occur.) Then we must travel up the
branch from the B node to the A node. We are now going to associate a probability with
each branch of the tree: the probability of traveling along that branch given that we have

gotten to its beginning node. For instance, the probability of traveling up the branch
from the starting position to the B node is P(B) = 300/2000 = .15 (see the data in the
survey). The probability of going up the branch from the B node to the A node is the
probability that A occurs, given that B has occurred. In other words, it is the condi-
tional probability P(A | B) ≈.33. (We calculated this probability at the beginning of
the section.) The probability of the outcome A ∩B can then be computed using the
multiplication principle:
P(A ∩B) = P(B)P(A | B) ≈(.15)(.33) ≈.05
In other words, to obtain the probability of the outcome A ∩B, we multiply the proba-
bilities on the branches leading to that outcome (Figure 9).

The same argument holds for the remaining three outcomes, and we can use the table
given at the beginning of this section to calculate all the conditional probabilities shown
in Figure 10.
Note The sum of the probabilities on the branches leaving any node is always 1 (why?).
This observation often speeds things up because after we have labeled one branch (or,
all but one, if a node has more than two branches leaving it), we can easily label the re-

Example 3 Unfair Coins
An experiment consists of tossing two coins. The ﬁrst coin is fair, while the second coin
is twice as likely to land with heads facing up as it is with tails facing up. Draw a tree
diagram to illustrate all the possible outcomes, and use the multiplication principle to
compute the probabilities of all the outcomes.
Solution A quick calculation shows that the probability distribution for the second
coin is P(H) = 2/3 and P(T) = 1/3. (How did we get that?) Figure 11 shows the tree
diagram and the calculations of the probabilities of the outcomes.

Independence
Let us go back once again to Cyber Video Games, Inc., and its ad campaign. How did
we assess the ad’s effectiveness? We considered the following events.
A: A video game player purchased Ultimate Hockey
B: A video game player saw the ad
We used the survey data to calculate P(A), the probability that a video game player pur-
chased Ultimate Hockey, and P(A | B), the probability that a video game player who
saw the ad purchased Ultimate Hockey. When these probabilities are compared, one of
three things can happen.
Case 1 P(A | B) > P(A)
This is what the survey data actually showed: A video game player was more likely to
purchase Ultimate Hockey if he or she saw the ad. This indicates that the ad is effective;
seeing the ad had a positive effect on a player’s decision to purchase the game.
Case 2 P(A | B) < P(A)
If this had happened, then a video game player would have been less likely to purchase
Ultimate Hockey if he or she saw the ad. This would have indicated that the ad had
“backﬁred”; it had, for some reason, put potential customers off. In this case, just as in
the ﬁrst case, the event B would have had an effect—a negative one—on the event A.
Case 3 P(A | B) = P(A)
In this case seeing the ad would have had absolutely no effect on a potential customer’s
buying Ultimate Hockey. Put another way, the probability of A occurring does not de-
pend on whether B occurred or not. We say in a case like this that the events A and B are
independent.

In general, we say that two events A and B are independent if P(A | B) = P(A).
When this happens, we have
P(A) = P(A | B) = P(A ∩B)
P(B)
so
P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B)
Conversely, if P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B), then, assuming P(B) ̸= 0,†
P(A) =
P(A ∩B)/P(B) = P(A | B). Thus, saying that P(A) = P(A | B) is the same as 
saying that P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B). Also, we can switch A and B in this last formula
and conclude that saying that P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B) is the same as saying that
P(B | A) = P(B).
7.5 Conditional Probability and Independence
499
† We shall only discuss the independence of two events in cases where their probabilities are both nonzero.
quick Examples
Independent Events
The events A and B are independent if
P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B)
Equivalent formulas (assuming neither A nor B is impossible) are
P(A | B) = P(A)
and
P(B | A) = P(B)
If two events A and B are not independent, then they are dependent.
The property P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B) can be extended to three or more indepen-
dent events. If, for example, A, B and C are three mutually independent events (that is,
each one of them is independent of each of the other two and of their intersection), then,
among other things,
P(A ∩B ∩C) = P(A)P(B)P(C)
Testing for Independence
To check whether two events A and B are independent, we compute P(A), P(B), and
P(A ∩B). If P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B), the events are independent; otherwise, they are
dependent. Sometimes it is obvious that two events, by their nature, are independent, so
a test is not necessary. For example, the event that a die you roll comes up 1 is clearly in-
dependent of whether or not a coin you toss comes up heads.
1. Roll two distinguishable dice (one red, one green) and observe the numbers that face
up.
A: The red die is even; P(A) = 18
36 = 1
2
B: The dice have the same parity*; P(B) = 18
36 = 1
2
To test for independence,
calculate the three quantities
P(A), P(B) and P(A   B)
separately, and then see if
P(A   B) = P(A)..P(B).
* Two numbers have the same parity if both are even or both are odd. Otherwise, they have opposite parity.

Chapter 7
Probability
A ∩B: Both dice are even; P(A ∩B) = 9
36 = 1
4
P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B) , and so A and B are independent.
2. Roll two distinguishable dice and observe the numbers that face up.
A: The sum of the numbers is 6; P(A) = 5
36
B: Both numbers are odd; P(B) = 9
36 = 1
4
A ∩B: The sum is 6, and both are odd; P(A ∩B) = 3
36 = 1
12
P(A ∩B) ̸= P(A)P(B), and so A and B are dependent.
Example 4 Weather Prediction
According to the weather service, there is a 50% chance of rain in New York and a 30%
chance of rain in Honolulu. Assuming that New York’s weather is independent of Hon-
olulu’s, ﬁnd the probability that it will rain in at least one of these cities.
Solution We take A to be the event that it will rain in New York and B to be the event
that it will rain in Honolulu. We are asked to ﬁnd the probability of A ∪B, the event that
it will rain in at least one of the two cities. We use the addition principle:
P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B)
We know that P(A) = .5 and P(B) = .3. But what about P(A ∩B)? Because the
events A and B are independent, we can compute
P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B)
= (.5)(.3) = .15
Thus,
P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B)
= .5 + .3 −.15
= .65
So, there is a 65% chance that it will rain either in New York or in Honolulu (or in both).
Example 5 Roulette
You are playing roulette, and have decided to leave all 10 of your $1 chips on black for
ﬁve consecutive rounds, hoping for a sequence of ﬁve blacks which, according to the
rules, will leave you with $320. There is a 50% chance of black coming up on each spin,
ignoring the complicating factor of zero or double zero. What is the probability that you
will be successful?
Solution Because the roulette wheel has no memory, each spin is independent of the
others. Thus, if A1 is the event that black comes up the ﬁrst time, A2 the event that it
comes up the second time, and so on, then
P(A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 ∩A4 ∩A5) = P(A1)P(A2)P(A3)P(A4)P(A5) =

think carefully about conditional probability.
7.5 Conditional Probability and Independence

Example 6 Legal Argument
A man was arrested for attempting to smuggle a bomb on board an airplane. During the
subsequent trial, his lawyer claimed that, by means of a simple argument, she would
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that her client was not only innocent of any crime,
but was in fact contributing to the safety of the other passengers on the ﬂight. This was
her eloquent argument: “Your Honor, ﬁrst of all, my client had absolutely no intention
of setting off the bomb. As the record clearly shows, the detonator was unarmed when
he was apprehended. In addition—and your Honor is certainly aware of this—there is
a small but deﬁnite possibility that there will be a bomb on any given ﬂight. On the
other hand, the chances of there being two bombs on a ﬂight are so remote as to be neg-
ligible. There is in fact no record of this having ever occurred. Thus, because my client
had already brought one bomb on board (with no intention of setting it off) and be-
cause we have seen that the chances of there being a second bomb on board were van-
ishingly remote, it follows that the ﬂight was far safer as a result of his action! I rest my
case.” This argument was so elegant in its simplicity that the judge acquitted the de-
fendant. Where is the ﬂaw in the argument? (Think about this for a while before read-
ing the solution.)
Solution The lawyer has cleverly confused the phrases “two bombs on board” and “a
second bomb on board.” To pinpoint the ﬂaw, let us take B to be the event that there is one
bomb on board a given ﬂight, and let A be the event that there are two independent bombs
on board. Let us assume for argument’s sake that P(B) = 1/1,000,000 = .000 001. Then
the probability of the event A is
(.000 001)(.000 001) = .000 000 000 001
This is vanishingly small, as the lawyer contended. It was at this point that the lawyer
used a clever maneuver: She assumed in concluding her argument that the probability of
having two bombs on board was the same as the probability of having a second bomb on
board. But to say that there is a second bomb on board is to imply that there already is
one bomb on board. This is therefore a conditional event: the event that there are two
bombs on board, given that there is already one bomb on board. Thus, the probability
that there is a second bomb on board is the probability that there are two bombs on
board, given that there is already one bomb on board, which is
P(A | B) = P(A ∩B)
P(B)
= .000 000 000 001
.000 001
= .000 001
In other words, it is the same as the probability of there being a single bomb on board to
begin with! Thus the man’s carrying the bomb onto the plane did not improve the ﬂight’s
safety at all.*
* If we want to be picky, there was a slight decrease in the probability of a second bomb because there was
one less seat for a potential second bomb bearer to occupy. In terms of our analysis, this is saying that the
event of one passenger with a bomb and the event of a second passenger with a bomb are not completely
independent.

Example 1 Steroids Testing
Gamma Chemicals advertises its anabolic steroid detection test as being 95% effective
at detecting steroid use, meaning that it will show a positive result on 95% of all ana-
bolic steroid users. It also states that its test has a false positive rate of 6%. This means
that the probability of a nonuser testing positive is .06. Estimating that about 10% of its
athletes are using anabolic steroids, Enormous State University (ESU) begins testing its
football players. The quarterback, Hugo V. Huge, tests positive and is promptly dropped
from the team. Hugo claims that he is not using anabolic steroids. How conﬁdent can we
be that he is not telling the truth?
Solution There are two events of interest here: the event T that a person tests positive,
and the event A that the person tested uses anabolic steroids. Here are the probabilities
we are given:
P(T | A) = .95
P(T | A′) = .06
P(A) = .10
Bayes’ Theorem and Applications
Should schools test their athletes for drug use? A problem with drug testing is that there
are always false positive results, so one can never be certain that an athlete who tests
positive is in fact using drugs. Here is a typical scenario.

For the second branching, we use the outcomes of the drug test: positive (T ) or negative
(T ′). The probabilities on these branches are conditional probabilities because they de-
pend on whether or not an athlete uses steroids (see Figure 13). (We ﬁll in the probabil-
ities that are not supplied by remembering that the sum of the probabilities on the
branches leaving any node must be 1.)
508
Chapter 7
Probability
We are asked to ﬁnd P(A | T), the probability that someone who tests positive is using
anabolic steroids. We can use a tree diagram to calculate P(A | T). The trick to setting
up the tree diagram is to use as the ﬁrst branching the events with unconditional proba-
bilities we know. Because the only unconditional probability we are given is P(A), we
use A and A′ as our ﬁrst branching (Figure 12).

We can now calculate the probability we are asked to ﬁnd:
P(A | T) = P(A ∩T)
P(T)
= P(Uses anabolic steroids and tests positive)
P(Tests positive)
P(Using A and T branches)
Sum of P(Using branches ending in T)
From the tree diagram, we see that P(A ∩T) = .095. To calculate P(T), the probabil-
ity of testing positive, notice that there are two outcomes on the tree diagram that reﬂect
a positive test result. The probabilities of these events are .095 and .054. Because these
two events are mutually exclusive (an athlete either uses steroids or does not, but not
both), the probability of a test being positive (ignoring whether or not steroids are used)
is the sum of these probabilities, .149. Thus,
P(A | T) =
.095
.095 + .054 = .095
.149 ≈.64
Thus there is a 64% chance that a randomly selected athlete who tests positive, like
Hugo, is using steroids. In other words, we can be 64% conﬁdent that Hugo is lying.

Bayes’ Theorem
The calculation we used to answer the question in Example 1 can be recast as a formula
known as Bayes’ theorem. Figure 14 shows a general form of the tree we used in
Example 1.
7.6 Bayes’ Theorem and Applications
509
+Before we go on... Note that the correct answer in Example 1 is 64%, not the 94% we
might suspect from the test’s false positive rating. In fact, we can’t answer the question
asked without knowing the percentage of athletes who actually use steroids. For in-
stance, if no athletes at all use steroids, then Hugo must be telling the truth, and so the
test result has no signiﬁcance whatsoever. On the other hand, if all athletes use steroids,
then Hugo is deﬁnitely lying, regardless of the outcome of the test.
False positive rates are determined by testing a large number of samples known not
to contain drugs and computing estimated probabilities. False negative rates are com-
puted similarly by testing samples known to contain drugs. However, the accuracy of the
tests depends also on the skill of those administering them. False positives were a sig-
niﬁcant problem when drug testing started to become common, with estimates of false
positive rates for common immunoassay tests ranging from 10–30% on the high end,53
but the accuracy has improved since then. Because of the possibility of false positive re-
sults, positive immunoassay tests need to be conﬁrmed by the more expensive and much
more reliable gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test. See also the
NCAA’s drug testing policy, available at http://www1.ncaa.org/membership/ed_outreach/
health-safety/drug_testing/index.html (the section on Institutional Drug Testing addresses
the problem of false positives). ■

We ﬁrst calculated 
P(A | T) = P(A ∩T)
P(T)
as follows. We ﬁrst calculated the numerator P(A ∩T) using the multiplication principle:
P(A ∩T) = P(T | A)P(A)

We then calculated the denominator P(T) by using the addition principle for mutually
exclusive events together with the multiplication principle:
P(T) = P(A ∩T) + P(A′ ∩T)
= P(T | A)P(A) + P(T | A′)P(A′)
Substituting gives
P(A | T) =
P(T | A)P(A)
P(T | A)P(A) + P(T | A′)P(A′ )
This is the short form of Bayes’ theorem.

Bayes’ Theorem (Short Form)
If A and T are events, then
Bayes’ Formula
P(A | T) =

P(T | A)P(A) + P(T | A′)P(A′)
Using a Tree
P(A | T) =
P(Using A and T branches)
Sum of P(Using branches ending in T)
Let us calculate the probability that an athlete from Example 1 who tests positive is
actually using steroids if only 5% of ESU athletes are using steroids. Thus,
P(T | A) = .95
P(T | A′) = .06
P(A) = .05
P(A′) = .95
and so
P(A | T) =
P(T | A)P(A)
P(T | A)P(A) + P(T |A′)P(A′) =
(.95)(.05)
(.95)(.05) + (.06)(.95) ≈.45
In other words, it is actually more likely that such an athlete does not use steroids than
he does.*
* Without knowing the results of the test we would have said that there was a probability of P(A) = 0.05 that
the athlete is using steroids. The positive test result raises the probability to P(A | T) = 0.45, but the test gives
too many false positives for us to be any more certain than that that athlete is actually using steroids.
Remembering the Formula Although the formula looks complicated at ﬁrst sight, it is
not hard to remember if you notice the pattern. Or, you could re-derive it yourself by
thinking of the tree diagram.
The next example illustrates that we can use either a tree diagram or the Bayes’
theorem formula.

We see that
P(L | T) =
P(Using L and T branches)
Sum of P(Using branches ending in T)

This means that there was only a 2.4% chance that poor Mrs. Good was lying and had
stolen from the store!

Example 2 Lie Detectors
The Sherlock Lie Detector Company manufactures the latest in lie detectors, and the
Count-Your-Pennies (CYP) store chain is eager to use them to screen their employees
for theft. Sherlock’s advertising claims that the test misses a lie only once in every 100
instances. On the other hand, an analysis by a consumer group reveals 20% of people
who are telling the truth fail the test anyway.* The local police department estimates that
1 out of every 200 employees has engaged in theft. When the CYP store ﬁrst screened
their employees, the test indicated Mrs. Prudence V. Good was lying when she claimed
that she had never stolen from CYP. What is the probability that she was lying and had
in fact stolen from the store?
Solution We are asked for the probability that Mrs. Good was lying, and in the pre-
ceding sentence we are told that the lie detector test showed her to be lying. So, we are
looking for a conditional probability: the probability that she is lying, given that the lie
detector test is positive. Now we can start to give names to the events:
L: A subject is lying
T: The test is positive (indicated that the subject was lying)
We are looking for P(L | T). We know that 1 out of every 200 employees engages in
theft; let us assume that no employee admits to theft while taking a lie detector test, so
the probability P(L) that a test subject is lying is 1/200. We also know the false nega-
tive and false positive rates P(T ′ | L) and P(T | L′).

Figure 15 shows the tree diagram.

Expanded Form of Bayes’ Theorem
We have seen the “short form” of Bayes’theorem. What is the “long form?” To motivate
an expanded form of Bayes’ theorem, look again at the formula we’ve been using:
P(A | T) =
P(T | A)P(A)
P(T | A)P(A) + P(T | A′)P(A′)
The events A and A′ form a partition of the sample space S; that is, their union is the
whole of S and their intersection is empty (Figure 16).
The expanded form of Bayes’ theorem applies to a partition of S into three or more
events, as shown in Figure 17.
By saying that the events A1, A2 and A3 form a partition of S, we mean that their
union is the whole of S and the intersection of any two of them is empty, as in the ﬁgure.
When we have a partition into three events as shown, the formula gives us P(A1 | T) in
terms of P(T | A1), P(T | A2), P(T | A3), P(A1), P(A2), and P(A3).

As for why this is true, and what happens when we have a partition into four or more
events, we will wait for the exercises. In practice, as was the case with a partition into
two events, we can often compute P(A1 | T) by constructing a tree diagram.
Example 3 School and Work
A survey* conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that approximately 22% of
the high school graduating class of 2004 went on to a two-year college, 44% went on to
a four-year college, and the remaining 34% did not go on to college. Of those who went
on to a two-year college, 52% worked at the same time, 32% of those going on to a

four-year college worked, and 62% of those who did not go on to college worked. What
percentage of those working had not gone on to college?
Solution We can interpret these percentages as probabilities if we consider the exper-
iment of choosing a member of the high school graduating class of 2004 at random. The
events we are interested in are these:
R1: A graduate went on to a two-year college
R2: A graduate went on to a four-year college
R3: A graduate did not go to college
A: A graduate went on to work
The three events R1, R2, and R3 partition the sample space of all graduates into three
events. We are given the following probabilities:
P(R1) = .22
P(R2) = .44
P(R3) = .34
P(A | R1) = .52
P(A | R2) = .32
P(A | R3) = .62
We are asked to ﬁnd the probability that a graduate who went on to work did not go to
college, so we are looking for P(R3 | A). Bayes’ formula for these events is
P(R3 | A) =
P(A | R3)P(R3)
P(A | R1)P(R1) + P(A | R2)P(R2) + P(A | R3)P(R3)
=
(.62)(.34)
(.52)(.22) + (.32)(.44) + (.62)(.34) ≈.45
Thus we conclude that 45% of all those working had not gone on to college.
+Before we go on... We could also solve Example 3 using a tree diagram. As before, the
ﬁrst branching corresponds to the events with unconditional probabilities that we know:
R1, R2, and R3. You should complete the tree and check that you obtain the same result
as above. ■

were cars, and the rest were pickups or SUVs. The probability
that a severe side-impact crash would prove deadly to a driver

State University’s women’s soccer ﬁtness test is automatically
dropped from the team. Last year, Mona Header failed the

In fact, a study by the ESU Physical Education Department
suggested that 50% of athletes ﬁt enough to play on the team
would fail the soccer test, although no unﬁt athlete could pos-
sibly pass the test. It also estimated that 45% of the athletes
who take the test are ﬁt enough to play soccer. Assuming these
estimates are correct, what is the probability that Mona was
justiﬁably dropped?

physics has no hope of passing, whereas 60% of the seniors
who do go on to a career in physics still fail the test. Further,
75% of all senior physics majors in fact go on to a career in
physics. Assuming that you fail the test, what is the probabil-
ity that you will not go on to a career in physics?

25. ◆Grade Complaints Two of the mathematics professors at
Enormous State are Professor A (known for easy grading) and
Professor F (known for tough grading). Last semester, roughly
three quarters of Professor F’s class consisted of former stu-
dents of Professor A; these students apparently felt encouraged
by their (utterly undeserved) high grades. (Professor F’s own
former students had ﬂed in droves to Professor A’s class to
try to shore up their grade point averages.) At the end of the
semester, as might have been predicted, all of Professor A’s
former students wound up with a C– or lower. The rest of the
students in the class—former students of Professor F who had
decided to “stick it out”—fared better, and two-thirds of them
earned higher than a C–. After discovering what had befallen
them, all the students who earned C– or lower got together and
decided to send a delegation to the Department Chair to com-
plain that their grade point averages had been ruined by this
callous and heartless beast! The contingent was to consist of
10 representatives selected at random from among them. How
many of the 10 would you estimate to have been former
students of Professor A?
26. Weather Prediction A local TV station employs Desmorelda,

Jupiter’s shadow on only one in every ﬁve rainless days. The
powers that be at the station notice a disturbing pattern to
Desmorelda’s weather predictions. It seems that she always
predicts that it will rain when Sagittarius is in the shadow of
Jupiter. What percentage of the time is she correct? Should

7.7 Markov Systems
Many real-life situations can be modeled by processes that pass from state to state with
given probabilities. A simple example of such a Markov system is the ﬂuctuation of a
gambler’s fortune as he or she continues to bet. Other examples come from the study of
trends in the commercial world and the study of neural networks and artiﬁcial intelli-
gence. The mathematics of Markov systems is an interesting combination of probability
and matrix arithmetic.
Here is a basic example we shall use many times: A market analyst for Gamble De-
tergents is interested in whether consumers prefer powdered laundry detergents or liquid
detergents. Two market surveys taken one year apart revealed that 20% of powdered
detergent users had switched to liquid one year later, while the rest were still using
powder. Only 10% of liquid detergent users had switched to powder one year later, with
the rest still using liquid.
We analyze this example as follows: Every year a consumer may be in one of two pos-
sible states: He may be a powdered detergent user or a liquid detergent user. Let us num-
ber these states: A consumer is in state 1 if he uses powdered detergent and in state 2 if he
uses liquid. There is a basic time step of one year. If a consumer happens to be in state 1
during a given year, then there is a probability of 20% = .2 (the chance that a randomly cho-
sen powder user will switch to liquid) that he will be in state 2 the next year. We write
p12 = .2
to indicate that the probability of going from state 1 to state 2 in one time step is .2. The
other 80% of the powder users are using powder the next year. We write
p11 = .8
to indicate that the probability of staying in state 1 from one year to the next is .8.† What
if a consumer is in state 2? Then the probability of going to state 1 is given as 10% = .1,
so the probability of remaining in state 2 is .9. Thus,
p21 = .1
and
p22 = .9
We can picture this system as in Figure 18, which shows the state transition diagram
for this example. The numbers pi j, which appear as labels on the arrows, are the transi-
tion probabilities.

† Notice that these are actually conditional probabilities. For instance, p12 is the probability that the system
(the consumer in this case) will go into state 2, given that the system (the consumer) is in state 1.
Markov System, States, and Transition Probabilities
A Markov system* (or Markov process or Markov chain) is a system that can be in
one of several speciﬁed states. There is speciﬁed a certain time step, and at each step
the system will randomly change states or remain where it is. The probability of going
from state i to state j is a ﬁxed number pi j, called the transition probability.
* Named after the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov (1856–1922) who ﬁrst studied these “non-deterministic”
processes.

Notice that, because the system must go somewhere at each time step, the transition
probabilities originating at a particular state always add up to 1. For example, in the
transition diagram above, when we add the probabilities originating at state 1, we get
.8 + .2 = 1.
The transition probabilities may be conveniently arranged in a matrix.
518
Chapter 7
Probability
quick Example
The Markov system depicted in Figure 18 has two states: state 1 and state 2. The transi-
tion probabilities are as follows:
p11 = Probability of going from state 1 to state 1 = .8
p12 = Probability of going from state 1 to state 2 = .2
p21 = Probability of going from state 2 to state 1 = .1
p22 = Probability of going from state 2 to state 2 = .9
quick Example
Transition Matrix
The transition matrix associated with a given Markov system is the matrix P whose
i jth entry is the transition probability pi j, the transition probability of going from state
i to state j. In other words, the entry in position ij is the label on the arrow going from
state i to state j in a state transition diagram.
Thus, the transition matrix for a system with two states would be set up as follows:

Note Notice that because the sum of the transition probabilities that originate at any
state is 1, the sum of the entries in any row of a transition matrix is 1. ■
Now, let’s start doing some calculations.
Example 1 Laundry Detergent Switching
Consider the Markov system found by Gamble Detergents at the beginning of this sec-
tion. Suppose that 70% of consumers are now using powdered detergent, while the other
30% are using liquid.
a. What will be the distribution one year from now? (That is, what percentage will be
using powdered and what percentage liquid detergent?)
b. Assuming that the probabilities remain the same, what will be the distribution two
years from now? Three years from now?

The ﬁrst branching shows the probabilities now, while the second branching shows
the (conditional) transition probabilities. So, if we want to know the probability that a
consumer is using powdered detergent one year from now, it will be
Probability of using powder after one year = .7 × .8 + .3 × .1 = .59.
On the other hand, we have:
Probability of using liquid after one year = .7 × .2 + .3 × .9 = .41.
Now, here’s the crucial point: These are exactly the same calculations as in the matrix

Thus, to get the distribution of detergent users after one year, all we have to do is
multiply the initial distribution vector [.7 .3] by the transition matrix P. The result is
[.59 .41], the distribution vector after one step.
b. Now what about the distribution after two years? If we assume that the same fraction
of consumers switch or stay put in the second year as in the ﬁrst, we can simply repeat
the calculation we did above, using the new distribution vector:

Solution
a. First, let us think of the statement that 70% of consumers are using powdered deter-
gent as telling us a probability: The probability that a randomly chosen consumer uses
powdered detergent is .7. Similarly, the probability that a randomly chosen consumer
uses liquid detergent is .3. We want to ﬁnd the corresponding probabilities one year
from now. To do this, consider the tree diagram in Figure 19.

What about the matrix Pm that appears above? Multiplying a distribution vector v
times Pm gives us the distribution m steps later, so we can think of Pm and the m-step
transition matrix. More explicitly, consider the following example.
520
Chapter 7
Probability
Thus, after two years we can expect 51.3% of consumers to be using powdered deter-
gent and 48.7% to be using liquid detergent. Similarly, after three years we have

= [.4591

So, after three years 45.91% of consumers will be using powdered detergent and
54.09% will be using liquid. Slowly but surely, liquid detergent seems to be winning.
+Before we go on... Note that the sum of the entries is 1 in each of the distribution
vectors in Example 1. In fact, these vectors are giving the probability distributions for
each year of ﬁnding a randomly chosen consumer using either powdered or liquid
detergent. A vector having nonnegative entries adding up to 1 is called a probability
vector. ■

Example 2 Powers of the Transition Matrix
Continuing the example of detergent switching, suppose that a consumer is now using
powdered detergent. What are the probabilities that the consumer will be using pow-
dered or liquid detergent two years from now? What if the consumer is now using liquid
detergent?
Solution To record the fact that we know that the consumer is using powdered deter-
gent, we can take as our initial distribution vector v = [1 0]. To ﬁnd the distribution
using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter for con-
venient ways to use a graphing
calculator or Excel to ﬁnd distrib-
ution vectors after several steps.
Online, follow:

You can then enter the transition
matrix P and the initial distribu-
tion vector v in the input area,
and compute the various distrib-
ution vectors using the following
formulas:
v*P

v*P^2
2 steps
v*P^3

What is true in Example 2 for two time steps is true for any number of time steps:

= [.66

So, the probability that our consumer is using powdered detergent two years from now
is .66, while the probability of using liquid detergent is .34. The point to notice is that
these are the entries in the ﬁrst row of P2. Similarly, if we consider a consumer now
using liquid detergent, we should take the initial distribution vector to be v = [0 1] and
compute
vP2 = [0

.66

= [.17

Thus, the bottom row gives the probabilities that a consumer, now using liquid deter-
gent, will be using either powdered or liquid detergent two years from now.
In other words, the ijth entry of P2 gives the probability that a consumer, starting in
state i, will be in state j after two time steps.

What happens if we follow our laundry detergent-using consumers for many years?
Example 3 Long-Term Behavior
Suppose that 70% of consumers are now using powdered detergent while the other 30%
are using liquid. Assuming that the transition matrix remains valid the whole time, what
will be the distribution 1, 2, 3, . . . , and 50 years later?

Thus, the distribution after 50 years is approximately [.33333334 .66666666].
Q: Where does the name steady-state vector come from?
A: If vP = v, then v is a distribution that will not change from time step to time step. In the
example above, because [1/3 2/3] is a steady-state vector, if 1/3 of consumers use powdered
detergent and 2/3 use liquid detergent one year, then the proportions will be the same the next
year. Individual consumers may still switch from year to year, but as many will switch from pow-
der to liquid as switch from liquid to powder, so the number using each will remain constant. ■
But how do we ﬁnd a steady-state vector?

The method we just used works for any size transition matrix and can be summa-
rized as follows.

Solution We are asked to ﬁnd
v∞= [x
y]
This vector must satisfy the equation
v∞P = v∞
or
[x y]

.8
.2
.1
.9

= [x y]
Doing the matrix multiplication gives
[.8x + .1y
.2x + .9y] = [x y]
Equating corresponding entries gives
.8x + .1y = x
.2x + .9y = y
or
−.2x + .1y = 0
.2x −.1y = 0
Now these equations are really the same equation. (Do you see that?) There is one more
thing we know, though: Because [x y] is a probability vector, its entries must add up to 1.
This gives one more equation:
x + y = 1
Taking this equation together with one of the two equations above gives us the follow-
ing system:
x +
y = 1
−.2x + .1y = 0
We now solve this system using any of the techniques we learned for solving systems of
linear equations. We ﬁnd that the solution is x = 1/3, and y = 2/3, so the steady-state
vector is
v∞= [x
y] =

Calculating the Steady-State Distribution Vector
To calculate the steady-state probability vector for a Markov System with transition
matrix P, we solve the system of equations given by
x + y + z + · · · = 1
[x
y
z . . .]P = [x
y
z . . .]
where we use as many unknowns as there are states in the Markov system. The steady-
state probability vector is then
v∞= [x
y
z . . .]

Q: Is there always a steady-state distribution vector ?
A: Yes, although the explanation why is more involved than we can give here. ■
Q: In Example 3, we started with a distribution vector v and found that vPm got closer and
closer to v∞as m got larger. Does that always happen ?
A: It does if the Markov system is regular, as we define below, but may not for other kinds of
systems. Again, we shall not prove this fact here. ■

Regular Markov Systems
A regular Markov system is one for which some power of its transition matrix P has no
zero entries. If a Markov system is regular, then
1. It has a unique steady-state probability vector v∞, and
2. If v is any probability vector whatsoever, then vPm approaches v∞as m gets large. We
say that the long-term behavior of the system is to have distribution (close to) v∞.
Interpreting the Steady-State Vector
In a regular Markov system, the entries in the steady-state probability vector give the
long-term probabilities that the system will be in the corresponding states, or the frac-
tions of time one can expect to ﬁnd the Markov system in the corresponding states.
1. The system with transition matrix P =

.8

is regular because P(= P1) has no
zero entries.
2. The system with transition matrix P =


is regular because P2 =

is not regular: P2 =


and 
P3 = P again, so the powers of P alternate between these two matrices. Thus, every
power of P has zero entries. Although this system has a steady-state vector, namely
[.5 .5], if we take v = [1 0], then vP = [0 1] and vP2 = v, so the distribution vec-
tors vPm just alternate between these two vectors, not approaching v∞.
We ﬁnish with one more example.
Example 5 Gambler’s Ruin
A timid gambler, armed with her annual bonus of $20, decides to play roulette using the
following scheme. At each spin of the wheel, she places $10 on red. If red comes up, she
wins an additional $10; if black comes up, she loses her $10. For the sake of simplicity,
assume that she has a probability of 1/2 of winning. (In the real game, the probability is
slightly lower—a fact that many gamblers forget.) She keeps playing until she has either
gotten up to $30 or lost it all. In either case, she then packs up and leaves. Model this
situation as a Markov system and ﬁnd the associated transition matrix. What can we say
about the long-term behavior of this system?
Solution We must ﬁrst decide on the states of the system. A good choice is the gam-
bler’s ﬁnancial state, the amount of money she has at any stage of the game. According

Note that once the system enters state 1 or state 4, it does not leave; with probability 1,
it stays in the same state.* We call such states absorbing states. We can now write down
the transition matrix:
P =


0
.5
0
.5
0
0
.5

.5
0



(Notice all the 0 entries, corresponding to possible transitions that we did not draw in the
transition diagram because they have 0 probability of occurring. We usually leave out
such arrows.) Is this system regular? Take a look at P2:
P2 =



.25
0



Notice that the ﬁrst and last rows haven’t changed. After two steps, there is still no
chance of leaving states 1 or 4. In fact, no matter how many powers we take, no matter
how many steps we look at, there will still be no way to leave either of those states, and
the ﬁrst and last rows will still have plenty of zeros. This system is not regular.
Nonetheless, we can try to ﬁnd a steady-state probability vector. If we do this
(and you should set up the system of linear equations and solve it), we ﬁnd that there
are inﬁnitely many steady-state probability vectors, namely all vectors of the form
[x 0 0 1 −x] for 0 ≤x ≤1. (You can check directly that these are all steady-state
vectors.) As with a regular system, if we start with any distribution, the system will tend
toward one of these steady-state vectors. In other words, eventually the gambler will
either lose all her money or leave the table with $30.
But which outcome is more likely, and with what probability? One way to approach
this question is to try computing the distribution after many steps. The distribution that
represents the gambler starting with $20 is v = [0 0 1 0]. Using technology, it’s easy
to compute vPn for some large values of n:
vP10 ≈[.333008
0
.000976
.666016]
vP50 ≈[.333333
0
0
.666667]
7.7 Markov Systems

to her rules, she can be broke, have $10, $20, or $30. Thus, there are four states: 1 = $0,
2 = $10, 3 = $20, and 4 = $30. Because she bets $10 each time, she moves down $10
if she loses (with probability 1/2) and up $10 if she wins (with probability also 1/2),
until she reaches one of the extremes. The transition diagram is shown in Figure 20.

Chapter 7
Probability
So, it looks like the probability that she will leave the table with $30 is approximately
2/3, while the probability that she loses it all is 1/3.
What if she started with only $10? Then our initial distribution would be v =
[0 1 0 0] and
vP10 ≈[.666016
.000976
0
.333008]
vP50 ≈[.666667
0
0
.333333]
So, this time, the probability of her losing everything is about 2/3 while the probability
of her leaving with $30 is 1/3. There is a way of calculating these probabilities exactly
using matrix arithmetic; however, it would take us too far aﬁeld to describe it here.
+Before we go on... Another interesting question is, how long will it take the gambler
in Example 5 to get to $30 or lose it all? Again, this can be calculated using matrix
arithmetic. ■

In order to gauge the effectiveness of the OHaganBooks.com
site, you recently commissioned a survey of online shoppers.
According to the results, 2 percent of online shoppers visited 
OHaganBooks.com during a one-week period, while 5 percent
of them visited at least one of OHaganBooks.com’s two main
competitors: JungleBooks.com and FarmerBooks.com. Use this
information to answer Exercises 43–47.
43. What percentage of online shoppers never visited
OHaganBooks.com?
44. Assuming that visiting OHaganBooks.com was independent
of visiting a competitor, what percentage of online shoppers
visited either OHaganBooks.com or a competitor?
45. Under the assumption of Exercise 44, what is the estimated
probability that an online shopper will visit none of the three
sites during a week?
46. Actually, the assumption in Exercise 44 is not what was found
by the survey, because an online shopper visiting a competitor
was in fact more likely to visit OHaganBooks.com than a ran-
domly selected online shopper. Let H be the event that an on-
line shopper visits OHaganBooks.com, and let C be the event
that he visits a competitor. Which is greater: P(H ∩C) or
P(H)P(C)? Why?
47. What the survey found is that 25 percent of online shoppers
who visited a competitor also visited OHaganBooks.com.
Given this information, what percentage of online shoppers
visited OHaganBooks.com and neither of its competitors?
Not all visitors to the OHaganBooks.com site actually purchase
books, and not all OHaganBooks.com customers buy through
the website (some call them in and others use a mail-order
catalog). According to statistics gathered at the website, 
8 percent of online shoppers who visit the site during the course
of a single week will purchase books. However, the survey men-
tioned prior to Exercise 43 revealed that 2 percent of online
shoppers visited the site during the course of a week. Another
survey estimated that 0.5 percent of online shoppers who did not
visit the site during the course of a week nonetheless purchased
books at OHaganBooks.com. Use this information to answer
Exercises 48–50.
48. Complete the following sentence: Online shoppers who visit
the OHaganBooks.com website are ___ times as likely to pur-
chase books than shoppers who do not.
49. What is the probability that an online shopper will not visit
the site during the course of a week but still purchase books?
50. What is the probability that an online shopper who purchased
books during a given week also visited the site?

CAS E  STU DY:
The Monty Hall Problem
Here is a famous “paradox” that even mathematicians
ﬁnd counterintuitive. On the game show Let’s Make a
Deal, you are shown three doors, A, B, and C, and be-
hind one of them is the Big Prize. After you select one
of them—say, door A—to make things more interest-
ing the host (Monty Hall), who knows what is behind
each door, opens one of the other doors—say, door
B—to reveal that the Big Prize is not there. He then
offers you the opportunity to change your selection to
the remaining door, door C. Should you switch or stick
with your original guess? Does it make any difference?
Most people would say that the Big Prize is equally likely to be behind door A or
door C, so there is no reason to switch.78 In fact, this is wrong: The prize is more likely
to be behind door C! There are several ways of seeing why this is so. Here is how you
might work it out using Bayes’ theorem.
Let A be the event that the Big Prize is behind door A, B the event that it is behind
door B, and C the event that it is behind door C. Let F be the event that Monty has
opened door B and revealed that the Prize is not there. You wish to ﬁnd P(C | F) using
Bayes’ theorem. To use that formula you need to ﬁnd P(F | A) and P(A) and similarly
for B and C. Now, P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = 1/3 because at the outset, the prize is
equally likely to be behind any of the doors. P(F | A) is the probability that Monty will
open door B if the Prize is actually behind door A, and this is 1/2 because we assume
that he will choose either B or C randomly in this case. On the other hand,
P(F | B) = 0, because he will never open the door that hides the prize. Also,
P(F | C) = 1 because if the prize is behind door C, he must open door B to keep from
revealing that the prize is behind door C. Therefore,
P(C | F) =
P(F | C)P(C)
P(F | A)P(A) + P(F | B)P(B) + P(F | C)P(C)
=
1 · 1
3
1
2 · 1
3 + 0 · 1
3 + 1 · 1
3
= 2
3
You conclude from this that you should switch to door C because it is more likely than
door A to be hiding the Prize.
Here is a more elementary way you might work it out. Consider the tree diagram of
possibilities shown in Figure 21.
The top two branches of the tree give the cases in which the Prize is behind door A,
and there is a total probability of 1/3 for that case. The remaining two branches with
nonzero probabilities give the cases in which the prize is behind the door that you did
not choose, and there is a total probability of 2/3 for that case. Again, you conclude that
you should switch your choice of doors because the one you did not choose is twice as
likely as door A to be hiding the Big Prize.
78 This problem caused quite a stir in late 1991 when this problem was discussed in Marilyn vos Savant’s col-
umn in Parade magazine. Vos Savant gave the answer that you should switch. She received about 10,000 let-
ters in response, most of them disagreeing with her, including several from mathematicians.
The Everett Collection

Exercises
1. The answer you came up with, to switch to the other door, depends on the strategy
Monty Hall uses in picking the door to open. Suppose that he actually picks one of
doors B and C at random, so that there is a chance that he will reveal the Big Prize. If
he opens door B and it happens that the Prize is not there, should you switch or not?
2. What if you know that Monty’s strategy is always to open door B if possible (i.e., it
does not hide the Big prize) after you choose A?
a. If he opens door B, should you switch?
b. If he opens door C, should you switch?
3. Repeat the analysis of the original game, but suppose that the game uses four doors
instead of three (and still only one prize).
4. Repeat the analysis of the original game, but suppose that the game uses 1000 doors
instead of three (and still only one prize).

Section 7.2
The TI-83 has a random number generator that we can use
to simulate experiments. For the following example, recall
that a fair coin has probability 1/2 of coming up heads and
1/2 of coming up tails.
Example Use a simulated experiment to check the 
following.
a. The estimated probability of heads coming up in a toss
of a fair coin approaches 1/2 as the number of trials gets
large.
b. The estimated probability of heads coming up in two
consecutive tosses of a fair coin approaches 1/4 as the
number of trials gets large.79
Solution with Technology
a. Let us use 1 to represent heads and 0 to represent tails.
We need to generate a list of random binary digits
(0 or 1). One way to do this—and a method that works
for most forms of technology—is to generate a random
number between 0 and 1 and then round it to the nearest
whole number, which will be either 0 or 1.
We generate random numbers on the TI-83 using the
“rand” function. To round the number X to the nearest
whole number on the TI-83, follow 
→NUM, se-
lect “round,” and enter round(X,0). This instruc-
tion rounds X to zero decimal places—that is, to the
nearest whole number. Since we wish to round a random
number we need to enter
round(rand,0)
To obtain rand, 
follow 
→PRB
The result will be either 0 or 1. Each time you press
you will now get another 0 or 1. The TI-83 can
also generate a random integer directly (without the
need for rounding) through the instruction
randInt(0,1)
To obtain randInt, 
follow 
→PRB
In general, the command randInt(m, n) generates a
random integer in the range [m, n]. The following se-
quence of 100 random binary digits was produced using
technology.80

If we use only the ﬁrst row of data (corresponding to the
ﬁrst ten tosses), we ﬁnd
P(H) = f r(1)
N
= 4
10 = .4
Using the ﬁrst two rows (N = 20) gives
P(H) = f r(1)
N
= 6
20 = .3
Using all ten rows (N = 100) gives
P(H) = f r(1)
N
= 54
100 = .54
This is somewhat closer to the theoretical probability of
1/2 and supports our intuitive notion that the larger the
number of trials, the more closely the estimated proba-
bility should approximate the theoretical value.81
b. We need to generate pairs of random binary digits and
then check whether they are both 1s. Although the TI-83
will generate a pair of random digits if you enter
round(rand(2),0), it would be a lot more conve-
nient if the calculator could tell you right away whether
both digits are 1s (corresponding to two consecutive
heads in a coin toss). Here is a simple way of accom-
plishing this. Notice that if we add the two random bi-
nary digits, we obtain either 0, 1, or 2, telling us the
number of heads that result from the two consecutive
throws. Therefore, all we need to do is add the pairs of
random digits and then count the number of times 2
comes up. A formula we can use is
randInt(0,1)+randInt(0,1)
What would be even more convenient is if the result of
the calculation would be either 0 or 1, with 1 signifying

79 Since the set of outcomes of a pair of coin tosses is {HH, HT, TH, TT},
we expect HH to come up once in every four trials, on average.
80 The instruction randInt(0,1,100)→L1 will generate a list of
100 random 0s and 1s and store it in L1, where it can be summed with

success (two consecutive heads) and 0 signifying failure.
Then, we could simply add up all the results to obtain the
number of times two heads occurred. To do this, we ﬁrst
divide the result of the calculation above by 2 (obtaining
0, .5, or 1, where now 1 signiﬁes success) and then round
down to an integer using a function called “int”:
int(0.5*(randInt(0,1)+randInt(0,1)))
Following is the result of 100 such pairs of coin tosses,
with 1 signifying success (two heads) and 0 signifying
failure (all other outcomes). The last column records the
number of successes in each row and the total number at
the end.

Now, as in part (a), we can compute estimated probabili-
ties, with D standing for the outcome “two heads”:
First 10 trials:
P(D) = f r(1)
N
= 2
10 = .2
First 20 trials:
P(D) = f r(1)
N
= 5
20 = .25
First 50 trials:
P(D) = f r(1)
N
= 13
50 = .26
100 trials:
P(D) = f r(1)
N
= 27
100 = .27
Q: What is happening with the data? The probabilities seem to
be getting less accurate as N increases!
A: Quite by chance, exactly 5 of the first 20 trials resulted in
success, which matches the theoretical probability. Figure 22
shows an Excel plot of estimated probability versus N (for N a
multiple of 10). Notice that, as N increases, the graph seems to
meander within smaller distances of .25. ■
Q: The above techniques work fine for simulating coin tosses.
What about rolls of a fair die, where we want outcomes between
1 and 6?
A: We can simulate a roll of a die by generating a random inte-
ger in the range 1 through 6. The following formula accom-
plishes this:

(We used 5.99999 instead of 6 to avoid the outcome 7.) ■

Excel has a random number generator that we can use to
simulate experiments. For the following example, recall
that a fair coin has probability 1/2 of coming up heads and
1/2 of coming up tails.
Example Use a simulated experiment to check the following.
a. The estimated probability of heads coming up in a toss
of a fair coin approaches 1/2 as the number of trials gets
large.
b. The estimated probability of heads coming up in two
consecutive tosses of a fair coin approaches 1/4 as the
number of trials gets large.82
Solution with Technology
a. Let us use 1 to represent heads and 0 to represent tails.
We need to generate a list of random binary digits (0 or
1). One way to do this—and a method that works for
most forms of technology—is to generate a random

Solution with Technology Finding the steady-state proba-
bility vector comes down to solving a system of equations.
As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, there are several ways to
use a calculator to help. The most straightforward is to use
matrix inversion to solve the matrix form of the system. In
this case, as in the text, the system of equations we need to
solve is

number between 0 and 1 and then round it to the nearest
whole number, which will be either 0 or 1.
In Excel, the formula RAND() gives a random number
between 0 and 1.83 The function ROUND(X,0) rounds
X to zero decimal places—that is, to the nearest integer.
Therefore, to obtain a random binary digit in any cell
just enter the following formula.
=ROUND(RAND(),0)
Excel can also generate a random integer directly (with-
out the need for rounding) through the formula
=RANDBETWEEN(0,1)
To obtain a whole array of random numbers, just drag
this formula into the cells you wish to use.
b. We need to generate pairs of random binary digits and
then check whether they are both 1s. It would be conve-
nient if the spreadsheet could tell you right away whether
both digits are 1s (corresponding to two consecutive
heads in a coin toss). Here is a simple way of accom-
plishing this. Notice that if we add two random binary
digits, we obtain either 0, 1, or 2, telling us the number
of heads that result from the two consecutive throws.
Therefore, all we need to do is add pairs of random dig-
its and then count the number of times 2 comes up. For-
mulas we can use are
=RANDBETWEEN(0,1)+RANDBETWEEN(0,1)
What would be even more convenient is if the result of
the calculation would be either 0 or 1, with 1 signifying
success (two consecutive heads) and 0 signifying failure.
Then, we could simply add up all the results to obtain the
number of times two heads occurred. To do this, we ﬁrst
divide the result of the calculation above by 2 (obtaining
0, .5, or 1, where now 1 signiﬁes success) and then round
down to an integer using a function called “int”:
=INT(0.5*(RANDBETWEEN(0,1)+
RANDBETWEEN(0,1)))
Following is the result of 100 such pairs of coin tosses,
with 1 signifying success (two heads) and 0 signifying
failure (all other outcomes). The last column records the
number of successes in each row and the total number at

To calculate the distribution after one step, use the array formula

Random Variables and Statistics
Introduction
Statistics is the branch of mathematics concerned with organizing, analyzing, and inter-
preting numerical data. For example, given the current annual incomes of 1000 lawyers
selected at random, you might wish to answer some questions: If I become a lawyer,
what income am I likely to earn? Do lawyers’ salaries vary widely? How widely?
To answer questions like these, it helps to begin by organizing the data in the form
of tables or graphs. This is the topic of the ﬁrst section of the chapter. The second section
describes an important class of examples that are applicable to a wide range of situa-
tions, from tossing a coin to product testing.
Once the data are organized, the next step is to apply mathematical tools for ana-
lyzing the data and answering questions like those posed above. Numbers such as the
mean and the standard deviation can be computed to reveal interesting facts about the
data. These numbers can then be used to make predictions about future events.
The chapter ends with a section on one of the most important distributions in sta-
tistics, the normal distribution. This distribution describes many sets of data and also
plays an important role in the underlying mathematical theory.
8.1 Random Variables and Distributions
Random Variables
In many experiments we can assign numerical values to the outcomes. For instance, if
we roll a die, each outcome has a value from 1 through 6. If you select a lawyer and
ascertain his or her annual income, the outcome is again a number. We call a rule that
assigns a number to each outcome of an experiment a random variable.
quick Examples
Random Variable
A random variable X is a rule that assigns a number, or value, to each outcome in the
sample space of an experiment.*

2. Select a mutual fund; X = the number of companies in the fund portfolio.

Discrete and Continuous Random Variables
A discrete random variable can take on only speciﬁc, isolated numerical values, like the
outcome of a roll of a die, or the number of dollars in a randomly chosen bank account.
A continuous random variable, on the other hand, can take on any values within a con-
tinuum or an interval, like the temperature in Central Park, or the height of an athlete in
centimeters. Discrete random variables that can take on only ﬁnitely many values (like
the outcome of a roll of a die) are called ﬁnite random variables.

Notes
1. In Chapter 7, the only sample spaces we considered in detail were ﬁnite sample
spaces. However, in general, sample spaces can be inﬁnite, as in many of the experi-
ments mentioned above.
2. There are some “borderline” situations. For instance, if X is the salary of a factory
worker, then X is, strictly speaking, discrete. However, the values of X are so numer-
ous and close together that in some applications it makes sense to model X as a con-
tinuous random variable. ■
For the moment, we shall consider only ﬁnite random variables.
Example 1 Finite Random Variable
Let X be the number of heads that come up when a coin is tossed three times. List the
value of X for each possible outcome. What are the possible values of X?
Solution First, we describe X as a random variable.
X is the rule that assigns to each outcome the number of heads that come up.
We take as the outcomes of this experiment all possible sequences of three heads
and tails. Then, for instance, if the outcome is HTH, the value of X is 2. An easy way to
list the values of X for all the outcomes is by means of a table.

could have taken X to be a different rule, such as the number of tails or perhaps the num-
ber of heads minus the number of tails. These different rules are examples of different
random variables associated with the same experiment. ■

Probability Distribution of a Finite Random Variable
Given a random variable X, it is natural to look at certain events—for instance, the event
that X = 2. By this, we mean the event consisting of all outcomes that have an assigned
X-value of 2. Looking once again at the chart in Example 1, with X being the number of
heads that face up when a coin is tossed three times, we ﬁnd the following events:
The event that X = 0 is {TTT}.
The event that X = 1 is {HTT, THT, TTH}.
The event that X = 2 is {HHT, HTH, THH}.
The event that X = 3 is {HHH}.
The event that X = 4 is ∅.
There are no outcomes with four heads.
Each of these events has a certain probability. For instance, the probability of the event
that X = 2 is 3/8 because the event in question consists of three of the eight possible
From the table, we also see that the possible values of X are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Example 2 Stock Prices
You have purchased $10,000 worth of stock in a biotech company whose newest arthri-
tis drug is awaiting approval by the F.D.A. If the drug is approved this month, the value
of the stock will double by the end of the month. If the drug is rejected this month, the
stock’s value will decline by 80%. If no decision is reached this month, its value will
decline by 10%. Let X be the value of your investment at the end of this month. List the
value of X for each possible outcome.
Solution There are three possible outcomes: the drug is approved this month, it is re-
jected this month, and no decision is reached. Once again, we express the random vari-
able as a rule.
The random variable X is the rule that assigns to each outcome the value of your
investment at the end of this month.
We can now tabulate the values of X as follows:

(equally likely) outcomes. We shall abbreviate this by writing
P(X = 2) = 3
8
The probability that X = 2 is 3/8.
Similarly,
P(X = 4) = 0
The probability that X = 4 is 0.
When X is a ﬁnite random variable, the collection of the probabilities of X equaling
each of its possible values is called the probability distribution of X. Because the prob-
abilities in a probability distribution can be estimated or theoretical, we shall discuss
both estimated probability distributions (or relative frequency distributions) and theo-
retical probability distributions of random variables. (See the next two examples.)
8.1 Random Variables and Distributions
547
Note The distinction between X (upper case) and x (lower case) in the tables above is
important; X stands for the random variable in question, whereas x stands for a speciﬁc
value of X (so that x is always a number). Thus, if, say x = 2, then P(X = x) means
P(X = 2), the probability that X is 2. Similarly, if Y is a random variable, then
P(Y = y) is the probability that Y has the speciﬁc value y. ■
quick Example
Probability Distribution of a Finite Random Variable
If X is a ﬁnite random variable, with values n1, n2, . . . then its probability distribu-
tion lists the probabilities that X = n1, X = n2, . . . The sum of these probabilities is
always 1.
Visualizing the Probability Distribution of a Random Variable
If each outcome in S is equally likely,  we get the probability distribution shown for the
random variable X.
Here P(X = x) means “the probability that the random variable X has the speciﬁc value x.”
Roll a fair die; X = the number facing up. Then, the (theoretical) probability that any
speciﬁc value of X occurs is 1
6. So, the probability distribution of X is the following

+Before we go on... The probabilities in the table in Example 3 are theoretical proba-
bilities. To obtain a similar table of estimated probabilities, we would have to repeatedly
toss a coin three times and calculate the fraction of times we got 0, 1, 2, and 3 heads. ■
Note The table of probabilities in Example 3 looks like the probability distribution as-
sociated with an experiment, as we studied in Section 7.2. In fact, the probability distri-
bution of a random variable is not really new. Consider the following experiment: toss
three coins and count the number of heads. The associated probability distribution (as
per Section 7.2) would be this:
The online simulation for Example 1
gives estimated probabilities for
the random variable of Example 3.

Example 3 Theoretical Probability Distribution
Let X be the number of heads that face up in three tosses of a coin. Give the probability
distribution of X.
Solution X is the random variable of Example 1, so its values are 0, 1, 2, and 3. The
probability distribution of X is given in the following table:
Notice that the probabilities add to 1, as we might expect.
We can use a bar graph to visualize a probability distribution. Figure 1 shows the
bar graph for the probability distribution we obtained. Such a graph is sometimes called
a histogram.

of the experiment, but as values of the random variable X. ■

using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter to see
how to use a TI-83/84 or Excel
to convert frequencies into 
probabilities.
Solution Statisticians refer to the income brackets as measurement classes. Because
the ﬁrst measurement class contains incomes that are at least $20,000, but less than
$30,000, its midpoint is $25,000.* Similarly the second measurement class has midpoint
$35,000, and so on. We can rewrite the table with the midpoints, as follows:
We have used the term frequency rather than number, although it means the same thing.
This table is called a frequency table. It is almost the probability distribution for X,
except that we must replace frequencies by probabilities. (We did this in calculating
estimated probabilities in the preceding chapter.) We start with the lowest measurement
class. Because 20 of the 1000 lawyers fall in this group, we have
P(X = 25,000) =
20
1000 = .02
We can calculate the remaining probabilities similarly to obtain the following distribution:
* One might argue that the midpoint should be (20,000 + 29,999)/2 = 24,999.50, but we round this to
25,000. So, technically we are using “rounded” midpoints of the measurement classes.
Note again the distinction between X and x: X stands for the random variable in question,
whereas x stands for a speciﬁc value (25,000, 35,000, . . . , or 85,000) of X.

Finally, we compute P(X ≥20), the probability of all events with an X-value of 20
or more. From the table, we obtain
P(X ≥20) = 2
30 + 0 + 1
30 = 3
30 = .1
Thus, there is a 10% chance that a country randomly selected from the given list pro-
duces 20 or more metric tons per capita of greenhouse gases.
Consider the experiment in which a country is selected at random from this list, and let
X be the per capita greenhouse gas emissions for that country. Find the probability dis-
tribution of X and graph it with a histogram. Use the probability distribution to compute
P(X ≥20) (the probability that X is 20 or more) and interpret the result.
Solution The values of X are the possible emissions ﬁgures, which we take to be 0, 5,
10, 15, 20, 25, and 30. In the table below, we ﬁrst compute the frequency of each value
of X by counting the number of countries that produce that per capita level of green-
house gases. For instance, there are 7 countries that have X = 15. Then, we divide each
frequency by the sample size N = 30 to obtain the probabilities.

FAQs
Recognizing What to Use as a Random Variable 
and Deciding on Its Values
Q: In an application, how, exactly, do I decide what to use as a random variable X?
A: Be as systematic as possible: First, decide what the experiment is and what its sample 
space is. Then, based on what is asked for in the application, complete the following sentence: 
“X assigns ___ to each outcome.” For instance, “X assigns the number of flavors to each packet
of gummy bears selected,” or “X assigns the average faculty salary to each college selected.” ■

8 These are customary names for the two possible outcomes, and often do not indicate actual success or failure
at anything. “Success” is the label we give the outcome of interest—in this case, ﬁnding a defective joystick.
8.2 Bernoulli Trials and Binomial 
Random Variables
Your electronic production plant produces video game joysticks. Unfortunately, quality
control at the plant leaves much to be desired, and 10% of the joysticks the plant pro-
duces are defective. A large corporation has expressed interest in adopting your product
for its new game console, and today an inspection team will be visiting to test video
game joysticks as they come off the assembly line. If the team tests ﬁve joysticks, what
is the probability that none will be defective? What is the probability that more than one
will be defective?
In this scenario we are interested in the following, which is an example of a particular
type of ﬁnite random variable called a binomial random variable: Think of the
experiment as a sequence of ﬁve “trials” (in each trial the inspection team chooses one
joystick at random and tests it) each with two possible outcomes: “success” (a defective
joystick) and “failure” (a non-defective one).8 If we now take X to be the number of

successes (defective joysticks) the inspection team ﬁnds, we can recast the questions
above as follows: Find P(X = 0) and P(X > 1).
8.2 Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Random Variables
555
quick Examples
Bernoulli Trial; Binomial Random Variable
A Bernoulli* trial is an experiment that has two possible outcomes, called success and
failure. If the probability of success is p then the probability of failure is q = 1 −p.
Visualizing a Bernoulli Trial:
Tossing a coin three times is an example of a sequence of independent Bernoulli
trials: a sequence of Bernoulli trials in which the outcomes in any one trial are inde-
pendent (in the sense of the preceding chapter) of those in any other trial, and in which
the probability of success is the same for all the trials.
A binomial random variable is one that counts the number of successes in a se-
quence of independent Bernoulli trials, where the number of trials is ﬁxed.

1. Roll a die ten times; X is the number of times you roll a 6.
2. Provide a property with ﬂood insurance for 20 years; X is the number of years, dur-
ing the 20-year period, during which the property is ﬂooded.†
3. You know that 60% of all bond funds will depreciate in value next year, and you ran-
domly select four from a very large number of possible choices; X is the number of
bond funds you hold that will depreciate next year. (X is approximately binomial.‡)
* Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) was one of the pioneers of probability theory.
† Assuming that the occurrence of ﬂooding one year is independent of whether there was ﬂooding in earlier
years.
‡ Since the number of bond funds is extremely large, choosing a “loser” (a fund that will depreciate next year)
does not signiﬁcantly deplete the pool of “losers,” and so the probability that the next fund you choose will be
a “loser,” is hardly affected. Hence, p is very nearly constant and we can think of X as being a binomial variable.

Example 1 Probability Distribution of a Binomial Random Variable
Suppose that we have a possibly unfair coin with the probability of heads p and the
probability of tails q = 1 −p.
a. Let X be the number of heads you get in a sequence of 5 tosses. Find P(X = 2).
b. Let X be the number of heads you get in a sequence of n tosses. Find P(X = x).
Solution
a. We are looking for the probability of getting exactly 2 heads in a sequence of 5 tosses.
Let’s start with a simpler question: What is the probability that we will get the se-
quence HHTTT?
The probability that the ﬁrst toss will come up heads is p.
The probability that the second toss will come up heads is also p.
The probability that the third toss will come up tails is q.
The probability that the fourth toss will come up tails is q.
The probability that the ﬁfth toss will come up tails is q.
The probability that the ﬁrst toss will be heads and the second will be heads and the
third will be tails and the fourth will be tails and the ﬁfth will be tails equals the prob-
ability of the intersection of these ﬁve events. Because these are independent events,
the probability of the intersection is the product of the probabilities, which is
p × p × q × q × q = p2q3
Now HHTTT is only one of several outcomes with two heads and three tails. Two oth-
ers are HTHTT and TTTHH. How many such outcomes are there altogether? This is
the number of “words” with two H’s and three T’s, and we know from Chapter 6 that
the answer is C(5, 2) = 10.
Each of the 10 outcomes with two H’s and three T’s has the same probability:
p2q3. (Why?) Thus, the probability of getting one of these 10 outcomes is the proba-
bility of the union of all these (mutually exclusive) events, and we saw in the preced-
ing chapter that this is just the sum of the probabilities. In other words, the probability
we are after is
P(X = 2) = p2q3 + p2q3 + · · · + p2q3
= C(5, 2) p2q3
C(5, 2) times
The structure of this formula is as follows:
Number of heads Number of tails
P(X = 2) = C(5, 2) p2q3
Number of tosses
Probability of tails
Number of heads Probability of heads
b. What we did using the numbers 5 and 2 in part (a) works as well in general. For the
general case, with n tosses and x heads, replace 5 with n and replace 2 with x to get:
P(X = x) = C(n, x) pxqn−x
(Note that the coefﬁcient of q is the number of tails, which is n −x.)

The calculation in Example 1 applies to any binomial random variable, so we can
say the following:

If X is the number of successes in a sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials, then
P(X = x) = C(n, x) pxqn−x

n = number of trials
p = probability of success
q = probability of failure = 1 −p

the die.
Example 2 Aging
The probability that a randomly chosen person in Cape Coral, FL, is 65 years old or
older* is approximately .2.
a. What is the probability that, in a randomly selected sample of 6 Cape Coral Floridians,
exactly 4 of them are 65 or older?
b. If X is the number of people aged 65 or older in a sample of 6, construct the proba-
bility distribution of X and plot its histogram.
c. Compute P(X ≤2).
d. Compute P(X ≥2).
Solution
a. The experiment is a sequence of Bernoulli trials; in each trial we select a person and
ascertain his or her age. If we take “success” to mean selection of a person aged 65 or
older, then the probability distribution is
P(X = x) = C(n, x) pxqn−x
where n = number of trials = 6
p = probability of success = .2
q = probability of failure = .8
So,
P(X = 4) = C(6, 4)(.2)4(.8)2
= 15 × .0016 × .64 = .01536

b. We have already computed P(X = 4). Here are all the calculations:
P(X = 0) = C(6, 0)(.2)0(.8)6
= 1 × 1 × .262144 = .262144
P(X = 1) = C(6, 1)(.2)1(.8)5
= 6 × .2 × .32768 = .393216
P(X = 2) = C(6, 2)(.2)2(.8)4
= 15 × .04 × .4096 = .24576
P(X = 3) = C(6, 3)(.2)3(.8)3
= 20 × .008 × .512 = .08192
P(X = 4) = C(6, 4)(.2)4(.8)2
= 15 × .0016 × .64 = .01536
P(X = 5) = C(6, 5)(.2)5(.8)1
= 6 × .00032 × .8 = .001536
P(X = 6) = C(6, 6)(.2)6(.8)0
= 1 × .000064 × 1 = .000064

Figure 3 shows its histogram.
c. P(X ≤2)—the probability that the number of people selected who are at least
65 years old is either 0, 1, or 2—is the probability of the union of these events and is
thus the sum of the three probabilities:
P(X ≤2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)
= .262144 + .393216 + .24576
= .90112
d. To compute P(X ≥2), we could compute the sum
P(X ≥2) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5) + P(X = 6)
but it is far easier to compute the probability of the complement of the event:
P(X < 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)
= .262144 + .393216 = .65536
and then subtract the answer from 1:
P(X ≥2) = 1 −P(X < 2)
= 1 −.65536 = .34464

FAQs
Terminology and Recognizing When to Use the Binomial Distribution
Q: What is the difference between Bernoulli trials and a binomial random variable?
A: A Bernoulli trial is a type of experiment, whereas a binomial random variable is the resulting
kind of random variable. More precisely, if your experiment consists of performing a sequence of
n Bernoulli trials (think of throwing a dart n times at random points on a dartboard hoping to hit
the bull’s eye), then the random variable X that counts the number of successes (the number of
times you actually hit the bull’s eye) is a binomial random variable. ■
Q: How do I recognize when a situation gives a binomial random variable?
A: Make sure that the experiment consists of a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials; that
is, a sequence of a fixed number of trials of an experiment that has two outcomes, where the
outcome of each trial does not depend on the outcomes in previous trials, and where the proba-
bility of success is the same for all the trials. For instance, repeatedly throwing a dart at a dart-
board hoping to hit the bull’s eye does not constitute a sequence of Bernoulli trials if you adjust
your aim each time depending on the outcome of your previous attempt. This dart-throwing 
experiment can be modeled by a sequence of Bernoulli trials if you make no adjustments after
each attempt and your aim does not improve (or deteriorate) with time. ■

Random Variables and Statistics
8.3 Measures of Central Tendency
Mean, Median, and Mode of a Set of Data
One day you decide to measure the popularity rating of your statistics instructor, Mr.
Pelogrande. Ideally, you should poll all of Mr. Pelogrande’s students, which is what
statisticians would refer to as the population. However, it would be difficult to poll
all the members of the population in question (Mr. Pelogrande teaches more than 400
students). Instead, you decide to survey 10 of his students, chosen at random, and ask
them to rate Mr. Pelogrande on a scale of 0–100. The survey results in the following set
of data:
60, 50, 55, 0, 100, 90, 40, 20, 40, 70
Such a collection of data is called a sample, because the 10 people polled represent only
a (small) sample of Mr. Pelogrande’s students. We should think of the individual scores
60, 50, 55, . . . as values of a random variable: Choose one of Mr. Pelogrande’s students
at random and let X be the rating the student gives to Mr. Pelogrande.
How do we distill a single measurement, or statistic, from this sample that would
describe Mr. Pelogrande’s popularity? Perhaps the most commonly used statistic is the
average, or mean, which is computed by adding the scores and dividing the sum by the
number of scores in the sample:
Sample Mean = 60 + 50 + 55 + 0 + 100 + 90 + 40 + 20 + 40 + 70
10
= 525
10 = 52.5
We might then conclude, based on the sample, that Mr. Pelogrande’s average popularity
rating is about 52.5. The usual notation for the sample mean is ¯x, and the formula we use
to compute it is
¯x = x1 + x2 + · · · + xn
n
where x1, x2, . . . , xn are the values of X in the sample.
A convenient way of writing the sum that appears in the numerator is to use
summation or sigma notation. We write the sum x1 + x2 + · · · + xn as
n

i=1
xi
We think of i as taking on the values 1, 2, . . . , n in turn, making xi equal x1, x2, . . . , xn in
turn, and we then add up these values.
Sample and Mean
A sample is a sequence of values (or scores) of a random variable X. (The process of
collecting such a sequence is sometimes called sampling X.) The sample mean is the
average of the values, or scores, in the sample. To compute the sample mean, we use the
n

i=1
by itself stands for “the sum, from i = 1 to n.”
n

i=1
xi stands for “the sum of the xi, from i = 1 to n.”

Note: Sample Mean versus Population Mean
Determining a population mean can be difﬁcult or even impossible. For instance,
computing the mean household income for the U.S. would entail recording the income
of every single household in the U.S. Instead of attempting to do this, we usually use
sample means instead. The larger the sample used, the more accurately we expect
the sample mean to approximate the population mean. Estimating how accurately a
sample mean based on a given sample size approximates the population mean is pos-
sible, but we will not go into that in this book. ■
The mean ¯x is an attempt to describe where the “center” of the sample is. It is
therefore called a measure of central tendency. There are two other common measures

If the sample x1, x2, . . . , xn consists of all the values of X from the entire population†
(for instance, the ratings given Mr. Pelogrande by all of his students), we refer to the
mean as the population mean, and write it as µ (Greek “mu”) instead of ¯x.
Visualizing the Mean

of central tendency: the “middle score,” or median, and the “most frequent score,” or
mode. These are deﬁned as follows.

Chapter 8
Random Variables and Statistics
quick Examples
Median and Mode
The sample median m is the middle score (in the case of an odd-size sample), or average
of the two middle scores (in the case of an even-size sample) when the scores in a sample
are arranged in ascending order.
A sample mode is a score that appears most often in the collection. (There may be
more than one mode in a sample.)
Visualizing the Median and Mode
As before, we refer to the population median and population mode if the sample con-
sists of the data from the entire population.
1. The sample median of 2, –3, –1, 4, 2 is found by ﬁrst arranging the scores in ascending
order: –3, –1, 2, 2, 4 and then selecting the middle (third) score: m = 2. The sample
mode is also 2 because this is the score that appears most often.
2. The sample 2, 5, 6, –1, 0, 6 has median m = (2 + 5)/2 = 3.5 and mode 6.
Median  Middle score  4
Mode  Most frequent score  2

The mean tends to give more weight to scores that are further away from the center
than does the median. For example, if you take the largest score in a collection of more
than two numbers and make it larger, the mean will increase but the median will remain
the same. For this reason the median is often preferred for collections that contain a
wide range of scores. The mode can sometimes lie far from the center and is thus used
less often as an indication of where the “center” of a sample lies.
Example 1 Teenage Spending
A 10-year survey of spending patterns of U.S. teenagers yielded the following ﬁgures*
(in billions of dollars spent in a year): 90, 90, 85, 80, 80, 80, 80, 85, 90, 100. Compute
and interpret the mean, median, and mode, and illustrate the data on a graph.
Solution The mean is given by
¯x =

i xi
n
= 90 + 90 + 85 + 80 + 80 + 80 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 100

10 = 86
Thus, spending by teenagers averaged $86 billion per year.

Expected Value of a Finite Random Variable
Now, instead of looking at a sample of values of a given random variable, let us look at
the probability distribution of the random variable itself and see if we can predict the
sample mean without actually taking a sample. This prediction is what we call the
expected value of the random variable.
8.3 Measures of Central Tendency
565
For the median, we arrange the sample data in ascending order:
80, 80, 80, 80, 85, 85, 90, 90, 90, 100
We then take the average of the two middle scores:
m = 85 + 85
2
= 85
This means that in half the years in question, teenagers spent $85 billion or less, and in
half they spent $85 billion or more.
For the mode we choose the score (or scores) that occurs most frequently: $80 billion.
Thus, teenagers spent $80 billion per year more often than any other amount.
The frequency histogram in Figure 4 illustrates these three measures.

+Before we go on... There is a nice geometric interpretation of the difference between
the median and mode: The median line shown in Figure 4 divides the total area of the
histogram into two equal pieces, whereas the mean line passes through its “center of
gravity”; if you placed the histogram on a knife-edge along the mean line, it would
balance. ■
Example 2 Expected Value of a Random Variable
Suppose you roll a fair die a large number of times. What do you expect to be the av-
erage of the numbers that face up?
Solution Suppose we take a sample of n rolls of the die (where n is large). Because the
probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6, we would expect that we would roll a 1 one sixth of
the time, or n/6 times. Similarly, each other number should also appear n/6 times. The
frequency table should then look like this:
x

Number of Times x is Rolled

(frequency)
Note that we would not really expect the scores to be evenly distributed in practice, al-
though for very large values of n we would expect the frequencies to vary only by a
small percentage. To calculate the sample mean, we would add up all the scores and
divide by the sample size. Now, the table tells us that there are n/6 ones, n/6 twos, n/6
threes, and so on, up to n/6 sixes. Adding these all up gives

i
xi = n
6 · 1 + n
6 · 2 + n
6 · 3 + n
6 · 4 + n
6 · 5 + n
6 · 6

The expected value of X is then the sum of the products x·P(X = x). This is how we
shall compute it from now on.

(Notice that we can obtain this number by multiplying the frequencies by the values of
X and then adding.) Thus, the mean is

Divide top and bottom by n.
= 3.5
This is the average value we expect to get after a large number of rolls or, in short, the
expected value of a roll of the die. More precisely, we say that this is the expected value
of the random variable X whose value is the number we get by rolling a die. Notice that
n, the number of rolls, does not appear in the expected value. In fact, we could redo the
calculation more simply by dividing the frequencies in the table by n before adding.
Doing this replaces the frequencies with the probabilities, 1/6. That is, it replaces the
frequency distribution with the probability distribution.
quick Example
Expected Value of a Finite Random Variable
If X is a ﬁnite random variable that takes on the values x1, x2, . . . , xn, then the expected
value of X, written E(X) or µ, is
µ = E(X) = x1 · P(X = x1) + x2 · P(X = x2) + · · · + xn · P(X = xn)
=

i
xi · P(X = xi)
In Words
To compute the expected value from the probability distribution of X, we multiply the
values of X by their probabilities and add up the results.
Interpretation
We interpret the expected value of X as a prediction of the mean of a large random sample
of measurements of X; in other words, it is what we “expect” the mean of a large number
of scores to be. (The larger the sample, the more accurate this prediction will tend to be.)
If X has the distribution shown,
then µ = E(X) = −1(.3) + 0(.5) + 4(.1) + 5(.1) = −.3 + 0 + .4 + .5 = .6.
To obtain the expected value,
multiply the values of X by their
probabilities, and then add the
results.

If X denotes the number of injuries sustained by a player during one season, compute
E(X) and interpret the result.
Solution We can compute the expected value using the following tabular approach:
take the probability distribution table, add another row in which we compute the product
x P(X = x), and then add these products together.

expected values.
Example 4 Roulette
A roulette wheel (of the kind used in the U.S.) has the numbers 1 through 36, 0 and 00.
A bet on a single number pays 35 to 1. This means that if you place a $1 bet on a single
number and win (your number comes up), you get your $1 back plus $35 (that is, you
gain $35). If your number does not come up, you lose the $1 you bet. What is the ex-
pected gain from a $1 bet on a single number?
Solution The probability of winning is 1/38, so the probability of losing is 37/38. Let
X be the gain from a $1 bet. X has two possible values: X = −1 if you lose and X = 35
if you win. P(X = −1) = 37/38 and P(X = 35) = 1/38. This probability distribution
and the calculation of the expected value are given in the following table:

The total of the entries in the bottom row is the expected value. Thus,
E(X) = 2.01
We interpret the result as follows: If many soccer players are observed for a season, we
predict that the average number of injuries each will sustain is about 2.

So, we expect to average a small loss of 2/38 ≈$0.0526 on each spin of the wheel.

A betting game in which the expected value is zero is called a fair game. For ex-
ample, if you and I ﬂip a coin, and I give you $1 each time it comes up heads but you
give me $1 each time it comes up tails, then the game is fair. Over the long run, we ex-
pect to come out even. On the other hand, a game like roulette in which the expected
value is not zero is biased. Most casino games are slightly biased in favor of the house.18
Thus, most gamblers will lose only a small amount and many gamblers will actually win
something (and return to play some more). However, when the earnings are averaged
over the huge numbers of people playing, the house is guaranteed to come out ahead.
This is how casinos make (lots of) money.
Expected Value of a Binomial Random Variable
Suppose you guess all the answers to the questions on a multiple-choice test. What score
can you expect to get? This scenario is an example of a sequence of Bernoulli trials (see
the preceding section), and the number of correct guesses is therefore a binomial ran-
dom variable whose expected value we wish to know. There is a simple formula for the
expected value of a binomial random variable.
568
Chapter 8
Random Variables and Statistics
+Before we go on... Of course, you cannot actually lose the expected $0.0526 on one
spin of the roulette wheel in Example 4. However, if you play many times, this is what
you expect your average loss per bet to be. For example, if you played 100 times, you
could expect to lose about 100 × 0.0526 = $5.26. ■
18 Only rarely are games not biased in favor of the house. However, blackjack played without continuous shufﬂe
machines can be beaten by card counting.
quick Example
Expected Value of Binomial Random Variable
If X is the binomial random variable associated with n independent Bernoulli trials, each
with probability p of success, then the expected value of X is
µ = E(X) = np
If X is the number of successes in 20 Bernoulli trials with p = .7, then the expected
number of successes is µ = E(X) = (20)(.7) = 14.
Where does this formula come from? We could use the formula for expected value and
compute the sum
E(X) = 0C(n, 0) p0qn + 1C(n, 1) p1qn−1 + 2C(n, 2) p2qn−2 + · · · + nC(n, n) pnq0
directly (using the binomial theorem), but this is one of the many places in mathematics
where a less direct approach is much easier. X is the number of successes in a sequence
of n Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success. Thus, p is the fraction of time
we expect a success, so out of n trials we expect np successes. Because X counts suc-
cesses, we expect the value of X to be np. (With a little more effort, this can be made into
a formal proof that the sum above equals np.)

Q: Wait a minute. How can a student get a fraction of a correct answer?
A: Remember that the expected value is the average number of correct answers a student will
get if he or she guesses on a large number of such tests. Or, we can say that if many students
use this strategy of guessing, they will average about 12.5 correct answers each. ■
Estimating the Expected Value from a Sample
It is not always possible to know the probability distribution of a random variable. For
instance, if we take X to be the income of a randomly selected lawyer, one could not be
expected to know the probability distribution of X. However, we can still obtain a good
estimate of the expected value of X (the average income of all lawyers) by using the
estimated probability distribution based on a large random sample.
8.3 Measures of Central Tendency
569
Example 5 Guessing on an Exam
An exam has 50 multiple-choice questions, each having 4 choices. If a student randomly
guesses on each question, how many correct answers can he or she expect to get?
Solution Each guess is a Bernoulli trial with probability of success 1 in 4, so p = .25.
Thus, for a sequence of n = 50 trials,
µ = E(X) = np = (50)(.25) = 12.5
Thus, the student can expect to get about 12.5 correct answers.

FAQs
Recognizing When to Compute the Mean and When to 
Compute the Expected Value
Q: When am I supposed to compute the mean (add the values of X and divide by n) and when am
I supposed to use the expected value formula?
A: The formula for the mean (adding and dividing by the number of observations) is used to
compute the mean of a sequence of random scores, or sampled values of X. If, on the other
hand, you are given the probability distribution for X (even if it is only an estimated probability
distribution) then you need to use the expected value formula. ■

8.4 Measures of Dispersion
Variance and Standard Deviation of a Set of Scores
Your grade on a recent midterm was 68%; the class average was 72%. How do you stand
in comparison with the rest of the class? If the grades were widely scattered, then your
grade may be close to the mean and a fair number of people may have done a lot worse
than you (Figure 5a). If, on the other hand, almost all the grades were within a few points
of the average, then your grade may not be much higher than the lowest grade in the
class (Figure 5b).

This scenario suggests that it would be useful to have a way of measuring not only
the central tendency of a set of scores (mean, median or mode) but also the amount of
“scatter” or “dispersion” of the data.
If the scores in our set are x1, x2, . . . , xn and their mean is ¯x (or µin the case of a popu-
lation mean), we are really interested in the distribution of the differences xi −¯x. We could
compute the average of these differences, but this average will always be 0. (Why?) It is re-
ally the sizes of these differences that interest us, so we might try computing the average of
the absolute values of the differences.This idea is reasonable, but it leads to technical difﬁ-
culties that are avoided by a slightly different approach:The statistic we use is based on the
average of the squares of the differences, as explained in the following deﬁnitions.

Q: The population variance is the average of the squares of the differences between the values
and the mean. But why do we divide by n −1 instead of n when calculating the sample
variance?
A: In real-life applications, we would like the sample variance to approximate the population
variance. In statistical terms, we would like the expected value of the sample variance s2 to be
the same as the population variance σ 2. The sample variance s2 as we have defined it is the 
“unbiased estimator” of the population variance σ 2 that accomplishes this task; if, instead, we
divided by n in the formula for s2, we would, on average, tend to underestimate the population
variance. (See the online text on Sampling Distributions for further discussion of unbiased esti-
mators.) Note that as the sample size gets larger and larger, the discrepancy between the for-
mulas for s2 and σ 2 becomes negligible; dividing by n gives almost the same answer as dividing
by n −1. ■
Here’s a simple example of calculating standard deviation.

Q: In Example 1, 33 percent of the scores fell within one standard deviation of the mean and all
of them fell within two standard deviations of the mean. Is this typical?
A: Actually, this is atypical due to the small number of scores involved. There are two useful
methods for estimating the percentage of scores that fall within any number of standard
deviations of the mean. The first method applies to any set of data, and is due to P.L. Chebyshev
(1821–1894), while the second applies to “nice” sets of data, and is based on the “normal
distribution,” which we shall discuss in Section 5. ■

5

5 = 0.8
Thus, the sample standard deviation is
s =
√
0.8 ≈0.9
Rounded to 1 decimal place
To ask which scores fall “within one standard deviation of the mean” is to ask
which scores fall in the interval [¯x – s, ¯x + s], or [5 −0.9, 5 + 0.9] = [4.1, 5.9]. Only
2 of the 6 scores (the two 5s) fall in this interval, so the percentage of scores that fall
within one standard deviation of the mean is 2/6 ≈33%.
For two standard deviations, the interval in question is [¯x −2s, ¯x + 2s] =
[5 −1.8, 5 + 1.8] = [3.2, 6.8], which includes all of the scores. In other words, 100%
of the scores fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

the end of the chapter to see
how to compute means and

Chebyshev’s Rule
For any set of data, the following statements are true:
At least 3/4 of the scores fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean (within the
interval [¯x −2s, ¯x + 2s] for samples or [µ −2σ, µ + 2σ] for populations).
At least 8/9 of the scores fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean (within the
interval [¯x −3s, ¯x + 3s] for samples or [µ −3σ, µ + 3σ] for populations).
At least 15/16 of the scores fall within 4 standard deviations of the mean (within
the interval [¯x −4s, ¯x + 4s] for samples or [µ −4σ, µ + 4σ] for populations).
. . .
At least 1 −1/k2 of the scores fall within k standard deviations of the mean (within
the interval [¯x −ks, ¯x + ks] for samples or [µ −kσ, µ + kσ] for populations).

The empirical rule could not be applied in Example 1. The distribution was not bell-
shaped (sketch it to see for yourself) and the fact that there were only 6 scores limits the
accuracy further. The empirical rule is, however, accurate in distributions that are bell-
shaped and symmetric, even if not perfectly so. Chebyshev’s rule, on the other hand, is
always valid (and applies in Example 1 in particular) but tends to be “overcautious” and
in practice underestimates how much of a distribution lies in a given interval.

Empirical Rule*
For a set of data whose frequency distribution is “bell-shaped” and symmetric (see
Figure 6), the following is true:
Approximately 68 percent of the scores fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean
(within the interval [¯x −s, ¯x + s] for samples or [µ −σ, µ + σ] for populations).
Approximately 95 percent of the scores fall within 2 standard deviations of the
mean (within the interval [¯x −2s, ¯x + 2s] for samples or [µ −2σ, µ + 2σ] for
populations).
Approximately 99.7 percent of the scores fall within 3 standard deviations of the
mean (within the interval [¯x −3s, ¯x + 3s] for samples or [µ −3σ, µ + 3σ] for
populations).
Visualizing the Empirical Rule
1. If the mean of a sample is 20 with standard deviation s = 2, then at least 15/16 =
93.75% of the scores lie within 4 standard deviations of the mean—that is, in the
interval [12, 28].
2. If the mean of a sample with a bell-shaped symmetric distribution is 20 with standard
deviation s = 2, then approximately 95 percent of the scores lie in the interval [16, 24].

* Unlike Chebyshev’s rule, which is a precise theorem, the empirical rule is a “rule of thumb” that is intention-
ally vague about what exactly is meant by a “bell-shaped distribution” and “approximately such-and-such
percent.” (As a result, the rule is often stated differently in different textbooks.) We will see in Section 8.5 that
if the distribution is a normal one, the empirical rule translates to a precise statement.

Example 2 Automobile Life
The average life span of a Batmobile® is 9 years, with a standard deviation of 2 years. My
own Batmobile lasted less than 3 years before being condemned to the bat-junkyard.
a. Without any further knowledge about the distribution of Batmobile life spans, what
can one say about the percentage of Batmobiles that last less than 3 years?
b. Reﬁne the answer in part (a), assuming that the distribution of Batmobile life spans is
bell-shaped and symmetric.
Solution
a. If we are given no further information about the distribution of Batmobile life spans,
we need to use Chebyshev’s rule. Because the life span of my Batmobile was more
than 6 years (or 3 standard deviations) shorter than the mean, it lies outside the range
[µ −3σ, µ + 3σ] = [3, 15]. Because at least 8/9 of the life spans of all Batmobiles
lie in this range, at most 1/9, or 11 percent, of the life spans lie outside this range
(see Figure 7). Some of these, like the life span of my own Batmobile, are less than
3 years, while the rest are more than µ + 3σ = 15 years.
b. Because we know more about the distribution now than we did in part (a), we can use
the empirical rule and obtain sharper results. The empirical rule predicts that approxi-
mately 99.7 percent of the life spans of Batmobiles lie in the range [µ −3σ, µ + 3σ] =
[3, 15]. Thus, approximately 1 −99.7% = 0.3% of them lie outside that range. Be-
cause the distribution is symmetric, however, more can be said: half of that 0.3 percent,
or 0.15 percent of Batmobiles will last longer than 15 years, while the other 0.15 per-
cent are, like my own ill-fated Batmobile, doomed to a life span of less than 3 years (see

Engineer on Amtrak’s nascent
Infrastructure 
Management
System (IMS), the team I work
with is using mathematics to en-
sure you have a safe, comfort-
able ride every time you step on
the train. The IMS is essentially
an enterprise asset management
system that will allow Amtrak to more effectively maintain
its infrastructure, manage its workforce, and control costs
associated with the maintenance of the railroad.
Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor is unique in that it is the
most heavily traversed stretch of railroad in the United States.
In addition, it is the only railroad that supports heavy freight
rail, commuter operations, and high-speed rail. Because of
these unique traffic patterns it is imperative to ensure that the
rail geometry is maintained to very high standards. One of the
ways in which we use mathematics to improve ride quality and
safety while reducing maintenance costs is through the devel-
opment of a “roughness profile” for the Amtrak owned and op-
erated rail along the Northeast Corridor. The roughness profile
is an excellent indicator of where track work must be done in
order to maintain a safe and comfortable railroad. Using the
latest in testing equipment, we are able to record many as-
pects of the rail geometry including the measurement of de-
formations in the rail caused by the varied weight and speed of
the trains running on the Corridor. From these measurements,
we then calculate the standard deviation from construction
and safety standards to create the aforementioned “rough-
ness profile”; we can then generate a work plan to improve
safety and comfort as well as optimize our resources.
While this is one explicit example of a real-world applica-
tion of mathematics that I’ve experienced in my career, it is
certainly not the only one. From computer programming to
project management to financial analysis, I have used virtu-
ally every mathematical discipline at one time or another. In
my experience, mathematics is everywhere you look.

Variance and Standard Deviation 
of a Finite Random Variable
We calculated the population variance by taking the mean of the quantities (xi −µ)2.
The xi are the values of a ﬁnite random variable X. Thus, the population variance of a set
of data can be written as the mean of all the values of (X −µ)2. But for a population,
the mean of all the values of (X −µ)2 is the same as the expected value of (X −µ)2,
which we can write as E([X −µ]2). In general, we make the following deﬁnition.

Variance and Standard Deviation of a Finite Random Variable
If X is a ﬁnite random variable taking on values x1, x2, . . ., xn, then the variance of X is
σ 2 = E([X −µ]2)
= (x1 −µ)2P(X = x1) + (x2 −µ)2P(X = x2) + · · · + (xn −µ)2P(X = xn)
=

i (xi −µ)2P(X = xi)
The standard deviation of X is then the square root of the variance:
σ =
√
σ 2
To compute the variance from the probability distribution of X, ﬁrst compute the ex-
pected value µ and then compute the expected value of (X −µ)2.
The following distribution has expected value µ = E(X) = 2:
The variance of X is
σ 2 = (x1 −µ)2P(X = x1) + (x2 −µ)2P(X = x2) + · · · + (xn −µ)2P(X = xn)
= (−1 −2)2(.3) + (2 −2)2(.5) + (3 −2)2(.1) + (10 −2)2(.1) = 9.2

above
• a row for the products (x −µ)2P(X = x), which we obtain by multiplying the values
in the second and the ﬁfth rows.

Exercise 3.
Note Chebyshev’s rule and the empirical rule apply to random variables just as they
apply to samples and populations, as we illustrate in the following example. ■
Example 4 Internet Commerce
Your newly launched company, CyberPromo, Inc., sells computer games on the Internet.
a. Statistical research indicates that the lifespan of an Internet marketing company such
as yours is symmetrically distributed with an expected value of 30 months and stan-
dard deviation of 4 months. Complete the following sentence:
There is (at least/at most/approximately)______ a _____ percent chance that
CyberPromo will still be around for more than three years.
b. How would the answer to part (a) be affected if the distribution of lifespans was not
known to be symmetric?
Solution
a. Do we use Chebyshev’s rule or the empirical rule? Because the empirical rule requires
that the distribution be both symmetric and bell-shaped—not just symmetric—we can-
not conclude that it applies here, so we are forced to use Chebyshev’s rule instead.

Variance and Standard Deviation 
of a Binomial Random Variable
We saw that there is an easy formula for the expected value of a binomial random vari-
able: µ = np, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. Simi-
larly, there is a simple formula for the variance and standard deviation.
582
Chapter 8
Random Variables and Statistics
Let X be the lifespan of an Internet commerce site. The expected value of X is
30 months, and the hoped-for lifespan of CyberPromo, Inc., is 36 months, which is
6 months, or 6/4 = 1.5 standard deviations, above the mean. Chebyshev’s rule tells us
that X is within k = 1.5 standard deviations of the mean at least 1 −1/k2 of the time;
that is,
P(24 ≤X ≤36) ≥1 −1
k2 = 1 −
1
1.52 ≈.56
In other words, at least 56 percent of all Internet marketing companies have life spans
in the range of 24 to 36 months. Thus, at most 44 percent have life spans outside this
range. Because the distribution is symmetric, at most 22 percent have life spans longer
than 36 months. Thus we can complete the sentence as follows:
There is at most a 22 percent chance that CyberPromo will still be around for more
than three years.
b. If the given distribution was not known to be symmetric, how would this affect the an-
swer? We saw above that regardless of whether the distribution is symmetric or not, at
most 44 percent have lifespans outside the range 24 to 36 months. Because the distri-
bution is not symmetric, we cannot conclude that at most half of the 44 percent have
lifespans longer than 36 months, and all we can say is that no more than 44 percent
can possibly have life spans longer than 36 years. In other words:
There is at most a 44 percent chance that CyberPromo will still be around for more
than three years.
quick Example
Variance and Standard Deviation of a Binomial Random Variable 
If X is a binomial random variable associated with n independent Bernoulli trials, each
with probability p of success, then the variance and standard deviation of X are given by
σ 2 = npq
and
σ = √npq
where q = 1 −p is the probability of failure.
If X is the number of successes in 20 Bernoulli trials with p = .7, then the standard
deviation is σ = √npq = √(20)(.7)(.3) ≈2.05.
34 Remember that the empirical rule only gives an estimate of probabilities. In Section 8.5 we give a more
accurate approximation that takes into account the fact that the binomial distribution is not continuous.
Note For values of p near 1/2 and large values of n, a binomial distribution is bell-
shaped and (nearly) symmetric, hence the empirical rule applies. One rule of thumb is
that we can use the empirical rule when both np ≥10 and nq ≥10.34 ■

8.4 Measures of Dispersion
583
Example 5 Internet Commerce
You have calculated that there is a 40 percent chance that a hit on your Web page results
in a fee paid to your company CyberPromo, Inc. Your Web page receives 25 hits per day.
Let X be the number of hits that result in payment of the fee (“successful hits”).
a. What are the expected value and standard deviation of X?
b. Complete the following: On approximately 95 out of 100 days, I will get between ___
and ___ successful hits.
Solution
a. The random variable X is binomial with n = 25 and p = .4. To compute µ and σ, we
use the formulas
µ = np = (25)(.4) = 10 successfulhits
σ = √npq =

(25)(.4)(.6) ≈2.45 hits
b. Because np = 10 ≥10 and nq = (25)(.6) = 15 ≥10, we can use the empirical rule,
which tells us that there is an approximately 95 percent probability that the number of
successful hits is within two standard deviations of the mean—that is, in the interval
[µ −2σ, µ + 2σ] = [10 −2(2.45), 10 + 2(2.45)] = [5.1, 14.9]
Thus, on approximately 95 out of 100 days, I will get between 5.1 and 14.9 successful hits.
FAQs
Recognizing When to Use the Empirical Rule or Chebyshev’s Rule
Q: How do I decide whether to use Chebyshev’s rule or the empirical rule?
A: Check to see whether the probability distribution you are considering is both symmetric 
and bell-shaped. If so, you can use the empirical rule. If not, then you must use Chebyshev’s
rule. Thus, for instance, if the distribution is symmetric but not known to be bell-shaped, you
must use Chebyshev’s rule. ■

Because each column is 1 unit wide, its area is numerically equal to its height.
Thus, the area of each rectangle can be interpreted as a probability. For example, in
Figure 9(a) the area of the rectangle over X = 3 represents P(X = 3). If we want to
find P(3 ≤X ≤5), we can add up the areas of the three rectangles over 3, 4 and 5,
shown shaded in Figure 10. Notice that if we add up the areas of all the rectangles in
Figure 9(a), the total is 1 because P(0 ≤X ≤10) = 1. We can summarize these
observations.

Properties of the Probability Distribution Histogram
In a probability distribution histogram where each column is one unit wide:
• The total area enclosed by the histogram is 1 square unit.
• P(a ≤X ≤b) is the area enclosed by the rectangles lying between and including
X = a and X = b.
This discussion is motivation for considering another kind of random variable, one
whose probability distribution is speciﬁed not by a bar graph, as above, but by the graph
of a function.
Continuous Random Variable; Probability Density Function
A continuous random variable X may take on any real value whatsoever. The proba-
bilities P(a ≤X ≤b) are deﬁned by means of a probability density function, a func-
tion whose graph lies above the x-axis with the total area between the graph and the
x-axis being 1. The probability P(a ≤X ≤b) is deﬁned to be the area enclosed by the
curve, the x-axis, and the lines x = a and x = b (see Figure 11).

Notes
1. In Chapter 7, we deﬁned probability distributions only for ﬁnite sample spaces. Be-
cause continuous random variables have inﬁnite sample spaces, we need the deﬁni-
tion above to give meaning to P(a ≤X ≤b) if X is a continuous random variable.
2. If a = b, then P(X = a) = P(a ≤X ≤a) is the area under the curve between the
lines x = a and x = a—no area at all! Thus, when X is a continuous random variable,
P(X = a) = 0 for every value of a.
3. Whether we take the region on the right in Figure 11 to include the boundary or not
does not affect the area. The probability P(a < X < b) is deﬁned as the area strictly
between the vertical lines x = a and x = b, but is, of course, the same as
P(a ≤X ≤b), because the boundary contributes nothing to the area. When we are
calculating probabilities associated with a continuous random variable,
P(a ≤X ≤b) = P(a < X ≤b) = P(a ≤X < b) = P(a < X < b) ■
Normal Density Functions
Among all the possible probability density functions, there is an important class of func-
tions called normal density functions, or normal distributions. The graph of a normal

density function is bell-shaped and symmetric, as the ﬁgure below shows. The formula
for a normal density function is rather complicated looking:
f (x) =

σ

2π
e−(x−µ)2
2σ2
The quantity µ is called the mean and can be any real number. The quantity σ is
called the standard deviation and can be any positive real number. The number
e = 2.7182 . . . is a useful constant that shows up many places in mathematics, much as
the constant π does. Finally, the constant 1/(σ
√
2π) that appears in front is there to
make the total area come out to be 1. We rarely use the actual formula in computations;
instead, we use tables or technology.

Calculating Probabilities Using the 
Standard Normal Distribution
The standard normal distribution has µ = 0 and σ = 1. The corresponding variable is
called the standard normal variable, which we always denote by Z. Recall that to cal-
culate the probability P(a ≤Z ≤b), we need to ﬁnd the area under the distribution
curve between the vertical lines z = a and z = b. We can use the table in the Appendix
to look up these areas, or we can use technology. Here is an example.

Chapter 8
Random Variables and Statistics
Example 1 Standard Normal Distribution
Let Z be the standard normal variable. Calculate the following probabilities:
a. P(0 ≤Z ≤2.4)
b. P(0 ≤Z ≤2.43)
c. P(−1.37 ≤Z ≤2.43)
d. P(1.37 ≤Z ≤2.43)
Solution
a. We are asking for the shaded area under the standard normal curve shown in Figure 13.
We can ﬁnd this area, correct to four decimal places, by looking at the table in the
Appendix, which lists the area under the standard normal curve from Z = 0 to Z = b
for any value of b between 0 and 3.09. To use the table, write 2.4 as 2.40, and read the
entry in the row labeled 2.4 and the column labeled .00. (2.4 + .00 = 2.40) Here is
the relevant portion of the table:

Thus, P(0 ≤Z ≤2.40) = .4918.
b. The area we require can be read from the same portion of the table shown above.
Write 2.43 as 2.4 + .03, and read the entry in the row labeled 2.4 and the column
labeled .03:
Z

→
Thus, P(0 ≤Z ≤2.43) = .4925.
c. Here we cannot use the table directly because the range −1.37 ≤Z ≤2.43 does not
start at 0. But we can break the area up into two smaller areas that start or end at 0:
P(−1.37 ≤Z ≤2.43) = P(−1.37 ≤Z ≤0) + P(0 ≤Z ≤2.43)

Calculating Probabilities for Any Normal Distribution
Although we have tables to compute the area under the standard normal curve, there are
no readily available tables for nonstandard distributions. For example, If µ = 2 and
σ = 3, then how would we calculate P(0.5 ≤X ≤3.2)? The following conversion for-
mula provides a method for doing so:

P(1.37  Z  0)
P(0  Z  2.43)
In terms of the graph, we are splitting the desired area into two smaller areas
(Figure 14).
We already calculated the area of the right-hand piece in part (b):
P(0 ≤Z ≤2.43) = .4925
For the left-hand piece, the symmetry of the normal curve tells us that
P(−1.37 ≤Z ≤0) = P(0 ≤Z ≤1.37)
This we can ﬁnd on the table. Look at the row labeled 1.3 and the column labeled .07,
and read
P(−1.37 ≤Z ≤0) = P(0 ≤Z ≤1.37) = .4147
Thus,
P(−1.37 ≤Z ≤2.43) = P(−1.37 ≤Z ≤0) + P(0 ≤Z ≤2.43)
= .4147 + .4925
= .9072
d. The range 1.37 ≤Z ≤2.43 does not contain 0, so we cannot use the technique of
part (c). Instead, the corresponding area can be computed as the difference of two
areas:
P(1.37 ≤Z ≤2.43) = P(0 ≤Z ≤2.43) −P(0 ≤Z ≤1.37)
= .4925 −.4147

Example 2 Quality Control
Pressure gauges manufactured by Precision Corp. must be checked for accuracy before
being placed on the market. To test a pressure gauge, a worker uses it to measure the pres-
sure of a sample of compressed air known to be at a pressure of exactly 50 pounds per square
inch. If the gauge reading is off by more than 1 percent (0.5 pounds), it is rejected. Assum-
ing that the reading of a pressure gauge under these circumstances is a normal random vari-
able with mean 50 and standard deviation 0.4, ﬁnd the percentage of gauges rejected.
Solution If X is the reading of the gauge, then X has a normal distribution with µ = 50
and σ = 0.4. We are asking for P(X < 49.5 or X > 50.5) = 1 −P(49.5 ≤X ≤50.5).

for a utility for this purpose.
In many applications, we need to know the probability that a value of a normal random
variable will lie within one standard deviation of the mean, or within two standard devia-
tions, or within some number of standard deviations. To compute these probabilities, we
ﬁrst notice that, if X has a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ, then
P(µ −kσ ≤X ≤µ + kσ) = P(−k ≤Z ≤k)
by the standardizing formula. We can compute these probabilities for various values of
k using the table in the Appendix, and we obtain the following results.

Now you can see where the empirical rule comes from! Notice also that the prob-
abilities above are a good deal larger than the lower bounds given by Chebyshev’s
rule. Chebyshev’s rule must work for distributions that are skew or any shape
whatsoever.

Example 3 Loans
The values of mortgage loans made by a certain bank one year were normally distrib-
uted with a mean of $120,000 and a standard deviation of $40,000.
a. What is the probability that a randomly selected mortgage loan was in the range of
$40,000–$200,000?
b. You would like to state in your annual report that 50 percent of all mortgage loans
were in a certain range with the mean in the center. What is that range?
Solution
a. We are asking for the probability that a loan was within 2 standard deviations
($80,000) of the mean. By the calculation done above, this probability is .9544.
b. We look for the k such that
P(120,000 −k · 40,000 ≤X ≤120,000 + k · 40,000) = .5
Because
P(120,000 −k · 40,000 ≤X ≤120,000 + k · 40,000) = P(−k ≤Z ≤k)
we look in the Appendix to see for which k we have
P(0 ≤Z ≤k) = .25
so that P(−k ≤Z ≤k) = .5. That is, we look inside the table to see where 0.25 is,
and ﬁnd the corresponding k. We ﬁnd
and
P(0 ≤Z ≤0.67) = .2486
P(0 ≤Z ≤0.68) = .2517
Therefore, the k we want is about half-way between 0.67 and 0.68, call it 0.675. This
tells us that 50 percent of all mortgage loans were in the range
to
120,000 −0.675 · 40,000 = $93,000
120,000 + 0.675 · 40,000 = $147,000
Normal Approximation to a Binomial Distribution
You might have noticed that the histograms of some of the binomial distributions we
have drawn (for example, those in Figure 1) have a very rough bell shape. In fact, in
many cases it is possible to draw a normal curve that closely approximates a given bi-
nomial distribution.

Notes
1. The condition that 0 ≤µ −3σ < µ + 3σ ≤n is satisﬁed if n is sufﬁciently large and
p is not too close to 0 or 1; it ensures that most of the normal curve lies in the range 0
to n.
2. In the formula P(a ≤X ≤b) ≈P(a −0.5 ≤Y ≤b + 0.5), we assume that a and b
are integers. The use of a −0.5 and b + 0.5 is called the continuity correction. To
see that it is necessary, think about what would happen if you wanted to approximate,
say, P(X = 2) = P(2 ≤X ≤2). Should the answer be 0?
Figures 15 and 16 show two binomial distributions with their normal approximations
superimposed, and illustrate how closely the normal approximation ﬁts the binomial
distribution.

Normal Approximation to a Binomial Distribution
If X is the number of successes in a sequence of n independent Bernoulli trials, with
probability p of success in each trial, and if the range of values of X within 3 standard de-
viations of the mean lies entirely within the range 0 to n (the possible values of X), then
P(a ≤X ≤b) ≈P(a −0.5 ≤Y ≤b + 0.5)
where Y has a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as X; that
is, µ = np and σ = √npq, where q = 1 −p.

Example 4 Coin Tosses
a. If you ﬂip a fair coin 100 times, what is the probability of getting more than 55 heads
or fewer than 45 heads?
b. What number of heads (out of 100) would make you suspect that the coin is not fair?
Solution
a. We are asking for
P(X < 45 or X > 55) = 1 −P(45 ≤X ≤55)
We could compute this by calculating
1 −[C(100, 45)(.5)45(.5)55 + C(100, 46)(.5)46(.5)54 + · · · + C(100, 55)(.5)55(.5)45]
but we can much more easily approximate it by looking at a normal distribution with
mean µ = 50 and standard deviation σ = √(100)(.5)(.5) = 5. (Notice that three
standard deviations above and below the mean is the range 35 to 65, which is well

8.5 Normal Distributions
597
within the range of possible values for X, which is 0 to 100, so the approximation
should be a good one.) Let Y have this normal distribution. Then
P(45 ≤X ≤55) ≈P(44.5 ≤Y ≤55.5)
= P(−1.1 ≤Z ≤1.1)
= .7286
Therefore,
P(X < 45 or X > 55) ≈1 −.7286 = .2714
b. This is a deep question that touches on the concept of statistical signiﬁcance: What
evidence is strong enough to overturn a reasonable assumption (the assumption that
the coin is fair)? Statisticians have developed sophisticated ways of answering this
question, but we can look at one simple test now. Suppose we tossed a coin 100 times
and got 66 heads. If the coin were fair, then P(X > 65) ≈P(Y > 65.5) =
P(Z > 3.1) ≈.001. This is small enough to raise a reasonable doubt that the coin is
fair. However, we should not be too surprised if we threw 56 heads because we can
calculate P(X > 55) ≈.1357, which is not such a small probability. As we said, the
actual tests of statistical signiﬁcance are more sophisticated than this, but we shall not
go into them.
FAQs
When to Subtract From .5 and When Not To
Q: When computing probabilities like, say P(Z ≤1.2), P(Z ≥1.2), or P(1.2 ≤Z ≤2.1) using
a table, just looking up the given values (1.2, 2.1 or whatever) is not enough. Sometimes you have
to subtract from .5, sometimes not. Is there a simple rule telling me what to do when?
A: The simplest—and also most instructive—way of knowing what to do is to draw a picture of
the standard normal curve, and shade in the area you are looking for. Drawing pictures also
helps one come up with the following mechanical rules:
1. To compute P(a ≤Z ≤b), look up the areas corresponding to |a| and |b| in the table. If a
and b have opposite sign, add these areas. Otherwise, subtract the smaller area from the
larger.
2. To compute P(Z ≤a), look up the area corresponding to |a|. If a is positive, add .5.
Otherwise, subtract from .5.
3. To compute P(Z ≥a), look up the area corresponding to |a|. If a is positive, subtract from .5.
Otherwise, add .5. ■

CAS E  STU DY :  Spotting Tax Fraud with Benford’s Law60
60 The discussion is based on the article “Following Benford’s Law, or Looking Out for No. 1” by Malcolm
W. Browne, The New York Times, August 4, 1998, p. F4. The use of Benford’s Law in detecting tax evasion is
discussed in a Ph.D. dissertation by Dr. Mark J. Nigrini (Southern Methodist University, Dallas).

You then do a quick calculation based on this probability distribution, and ﬁnd an ex-
pected value of E(X) = 5. Next, you turn to the Colossal Conglomerate tax return data
and calculate the relative frequency (estimated probability) of the actual numbers in the
tax return. You ﬁnd the following results.
Colossal Conglomerate Return
You are a tax fraud specialist working for the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS), and you have just been handed
a portion of the tax return from Colossal Conglomer-
ate. The IRS suspects that the portion you were handed
may be fraudulent, and would like your opinion. Is
there any mathematical test, you wonder, that can point
to a suspicious tax return based on nothing more than
the numbers entered? 
You decide, on an impulse, to make a list of the ﬁrst
digits of all the numbers entered in the portion of the
Colossal Conglomerate tax return (there are 625 of them). You reason that, if the tax re-
turn is an honest one, the ﬁrst digits of the numbers should be uniformly distributed.
More precisely, if the experiment consists of selecting a number at random from the tax
return, and the random variable X is deﬁned to be the ﬁrst digit of the selected number,
then X should have the following probability distribution: 
age fotostock/SuperStock

It certainly does look suspicious! For one thing, the digits 1 and 5 seem to occur a
lot more often than any of the other digits, and roughly 3 times what you predicted.
Moreover, when you compute the expected value, you obtain E(Y) = 3.48, considerably
lower than the value of 5 you predicted. Gotcha! you exclaim.
You are about to ﬁle a report recommending a detailed audit of Colossal Conglom-
erate when you recall an article you once read about ﬁrst digits in lists of numbers. The
article dealt with a remarkable discovery in 1938 by Dr. Frank Benford, a physicist at
General Electric. What Dr. Benford noticed was that the pages of logarithm tables that
listed numbers starting with the digits 1 and 2 tended to be more soiled and dog-eared
than the pages that listed numbers starting with higher digits—say, 8. For some reason,
numbers that start with low digits seemed more prevalent than numbers that start with
high digits. He subsequently analyzed more than 20,000 sets of numbers, such as tables
of baseball statistics, listings of widths of rivers, half-lives of radioactive elements,
street addresses, and numbers in magazine articles. The result was always the same: In-
explicably, numbers that start with low digits tended to appear more frequently than
those that start with high ones, with numbers beginning with the digit 1 most prevalent
of all.61 Moreover, the expected value of the ﬁrst digit was not the expected 5, but 3.44. 
Because the ﬁrst digits in Colossal Conglomerate’s return have an expected value of
3.48, very close to Benford’s value, it might appear that your suspicion was groundless
after all. (Back to the drawing board . . .)
Out of curiosity, you decide to investigate Benford’s discovery more carefully. What
you ﬁnd is that Benford did more than simply observe a strange phenomenon in lists of
numbers. He went further and derived the following formula for the probability distrib-
ution of ﬁrst digits in lists of numbers:
P(X = x) = log(1 + 1/x)
(x = 1, 2, . . . , 9)
You compute these probabilities, and ﬁnd the following distribution (the probabilities
are all rounded, and thus do not add to exactly 1).
604
Chapter 8
Random Variables and Statistics
61 This does not apply to all lists of numbers. For instance, a list of randomly chosen numbers between 100 and
999 will have ﬁrst digits uniformly distributed between 1 and 9.

Benford
Colossal Conglomerate
You then enter these data along with the Colossal Conglomerate tax return data in your
spreadsheet program and obtain the graph shown in Figure 17.
The graph shows something awfully suspicious happening with the digit 5. The per-
centage of numbers in the Colossal Conglomerate return that begin with 5 far exceeds
Benford’s prediction that approximately 8 percent of all numbers should begin with 5.
Now it seems fairly clear that you are justiﬁed in recommending Colossal Con-
glomerate for an audit, after all.
Q: Because no given set of data can reasonably be expected to satisfy Benford’s Law exactly,
how can I be certain that the Colossal Conglomerate data is not simply due to chance?
A: You can never be 100 percent certain. It is certainly conceivable that the tax figures just hap-
pen to result in the “abnormal” distribution in the Colossal Conglomerate tax return. However—
and this is the subject of “inferential statistics”—there is a method for deciding whether you can
be, say “95 percent certain” that the anomaly reflected in the data is not due to chance. To check,
you must first compute a statistic that determines how far a given set of data deviates from
Figure 17

satisfying a theoretical prediction (Benford’s Law, in this case). This statistic is called a sum-of-
squares error, and given by the following formula (reminiscent of the variance):
SSE = n

[P(y1) −P(x1)]2
P(xi)
+ [P(y2) −P(x2)]2
P(x2)
+ · · · + [P(y9) −P(x9)]2
P(x9)
	
Here, n is the sample size: 625 in the case of Colossal Conglomerate. The quantities P(xi ) are
the theoretically predicted probabilities according to Benford’s Law, and the P(yi ) are the prob-
abilities in the Colossal Conglomerate return. Notice that if the Colossal Conglomerate return
probabilities had exactly matched the theoretically predicted probabilities, then SSE would have
been zero. Notice also the effect of multiplying by the sample size n: The larger the sample, the
more likely that the discrepancy between the P(xi ) and the P(yi ) is not due to chance. Substi-
tuting the numbers gives
SSE ≈625

[.29 −.30]2
.30
+ [.1 −.18]2
.18
+ · · · + [.01 −.05]2
.05
	
≈55262
■
Q: The value of SSE does seem quite large. But how can I use this figure in my report? I would
like to say something impressive, such as “Based on the portion of the Colossal Conglomerate tax
return analyzed, one can be 95 percent certain that the figures are anomalous.”?
A: The error SSE is used by statisticians to answer exactly such a question. What they would
do is compare this figure to the largest SSE we would have expected to get by chance in 95 out
of 100 selections of data that do satisfy Benford’s law. This “biggest error” is computed using a
“Chi-Squared” distribution and can be found in Excel by entering 
=CHIINV(0.05, 8)
Here, the 0.05 is 1 −0.95, encoding the “95 percent certainty,” and the 8 is called the “number
of degrees of freedom” = number of outcomes (9) minus 1.
You now find, using Excel, that the chi-squared figure is 15.5, meaning that the largest SSE
that you could have expected purely by chance is 15.5. Because Colossal Conglomerate’s error
is much larger at 552, you can now justifiably say in your report that there is a 95% certainty
that the figures are anomalous.63 ■
Exercises
Which of the following lists of data would you expect to follow Benford’s law? If the
answer is “no,” give a reason.
1. Distances between cities in France, measured in kilometers.
2. Distances between cities in France, measured in miles.
3. The grades (0–100) in your math instructor’s grade book.
4. The Dow Jones averages for the past 100 years.
5. Verbal SAT scores of college-bound high school seniors.
6. Life spans of companies.
Case Study
605
62 If you use more accurate values for the probabilities in Benford’s distribution, the value is approximately
560.
63 What this actually means is that, if you were to do a similar analysis on a large number of tax returns, and
you designated as “not conforming to Benford’s Law” all of those whose value of SSE was larger than 15.5,
you would be justiﬁed in 95 percent of the cases.

Ex Use technology to determine whether the given distribution of ﬁrst digits fails,
with 95 percent certainty, to follow Benford’s law.

Example 2 Pressure gauges manufactured by Precision
Corp. must be checked for accuracy before being placed on
the market. To test a pressure gauge, a worker uses it to mea-
sure the pressure of a sample of compressed air known to be
at a pressure of exactly 50 pounds per square inch. If the
gauge reading is off by more than 1 percent (0.5 pounds), it
is rejected. Assuming that the reading of a pressure gauge
under these circumstances is a normal random variable with

tion permits us to compute P(a ≤X ≤b) for non-

P(a ≤X ≤b)
For example, we can compute P(49.5 ≤X ≤50.5) by
entering
normalcdf(49.5, 50.5, 50, 0.4)
Then subtract it from 1 to obtain the answer:

Corp. must be checked for accuracy before being placed on
the market. To test a pressure gauge, a worker uses it to
measure the pressure of a sample of compressed air known
to be at a pressure of exactly 50 pounds per square inch. If
the gauge reading is off by more than 1 percent (0.5 pounds),
it is rejected. Assuming that the reading of a pressure gauge
under these circumstances is a normal random variable
with mean 50 and standard deviation 0.4, ﬁnd the percent-

CA S E  STU DY Checking up on Malthus
In 1798 Thomas R. Malthus (1766–1834) published an inﬂuential pamphlet, later expanded
into a book, titled An Essay on the Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improve-
ment of Society. One of his main contentions was that population grows geometrically
(exponentially), while the supply of resources such as food grows only arithmetically (linearly).
Some 200 years later, you have been asked to check the validity of Malthus’s contention.
How do you go about doing so?

Introduction
To see if Malthus was right, we need to see if the data ﬁt the models (linear and expo-
nential) that he suggested or if other models would be better. We saw in Chapter 1 how
to ﬁt a linear model. In this chapter we discuss how to construct models using various
nonlinear functions.
The nonlinear functions we consider in this chapter are the quadratic functions, the
simplest nonlinear functions; the exponential functions, essential for discussing many
kinds of growth and decay, including the growth (and decay) of money in ﬁnance and
the initial growth of an epidemic; the logarithmic functions, needed to fully understand
the exponential functions; and the logistic functions, used to model growth with an
upper limit, such as the spread of an epidemic.
algebra Review
For this chapter, you should be
familiar with the algebra re-
viewed in Chapter 0, Section 2.
9.1 Quadratic Functions and Models
In Chapter 1 we studied linear functions. Linear functions are useful, but in real-life ap-
plications, they are often accurate for only a limited range of values of the variables. The
relationship between two quantities is often best modeled by a curved line rather than a
straight line. The simplest function with a graph that is not a straight line is a quadratic
function.
quick Examples
Quadratic Function
A quadratic function of the variable x is a function that can be written in the form
f (x) = ax2 + bx + c
Function form
or
y = ax2 + bx + c
Equation form
where a, b, and c are ﬁxed numbers (with a ̸= 0).
1. f (x) = 3x2 −2x + 1
a = 3, b = −2, c = 1
2. g(x) = −x2
a = −1, b = 0, c = 0
3. R( p) = −5600p2 + 14,000p
a = −5600, b = 14,000, c = 0
Every quadratic function f (x) = ax2 + bx + c (a ̸= 0) has a parabola as its
graph. Following is a summary of some features of parabolas that we can use to sketch
the graph of any quadratic function.1
1 We shall not fully justify the formula for the vertex and the axis of symmetry until we have studied some
calculus, although it is possible to do so with just algebra.

9.1 Quadratic Functions and Models
617
Features of a Parabola
The graph of f (x) = ax2 + bx + c (a ̸= 0) is a parabola. If a > 0 the parabola opens
upward (concave up) and if a < 0 it opens downward (concave down):
concave up
concave down
(a > 0)
(a < 0)
Vertex, Intercepts, and Symmetry

The vertex is the turning point of the parabola (see the above ﬁgure). Its
x-coordinate is −b

.
x-Intercepts
(if any) These occur when f (x) = 0; that is, when
ax2 + bx + c = 0
Solve this equation for x by either factoring or using the quadratic formula. The 
x-intercepts are
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
If the discriminant b2 −4ac is positive, there are two x-intercepts. If it is zero, there is
a single x-intercept (at the vertex). If it is negative, there are no x-intercepts (so the
parabola doesn’t touch the x-axis at all).
y-Intercept
This occurs when x = 0, so
y = a(0)2 + b(0) + c = c
Symmetry
The parabola is symmetric with respect to the vertical line through the 
vertex, which is the line x = −b
2a .

making it clear that they are located symmetrically on either side of the line
x = −b/(2a). This partially justiﬁes the claim that the whole parabola is symmetric
with respect to this line.

Nonlinear Models
Example 1 Sketching the Graph of a Quadratic Function
Sketch the graph of f (x) = x2 + 2x −8 by hand.
Solution Here, a = 1, b = 2, and c = −8. Because a > 0, the parabola is concave up
(Figure 1).
Vertex: The x-coordinate of the vertex is
x = −b
2a = −2
2 = −1
To get its y-coordinate, we substitute the value of x back into f (x) to get
y = f (−1) = (−1)2 + 2(−1) −8 = 1 −2 −8 = −9
Thus, the coordinates of the vertex are (−1, −9).
x-Intercepts: To calculate the x-intercepts (if any), we solve the equation
x2 + 2x −8 = 0
Luckily, this equation factors as (x + 4)(x −2) = 0. Thus, the solutions are x = −4
and x = 2, so these values are the x-intercepts. (We could also have used the quadratic
formula here.)
y-Intercept: The y-intercept is given by c = −8.
Symmetry: The graph is symmetric around the vertical line x = −1.
Now we can sketch the curve as in Figure 2. (As we see in the ﬁgure, it is helpful to
plot additional points using the equation y = x2 + 2x −8, and to use symmetry to
obtain others.)
y = x2 + 2x −8

Example 2 One x-Intercept and No x-Intercepts

b. g(x) = −1
2x2 + 4x −12

Thus, the vertex is at the point (3/2, 0).
x-Intercepts:
4x2 −12x + 9 = 0
(2x −3)2 = 0
The only solution is 2x −3 = 0, or x = 3/2. Note that this coincides with the vertex,
which lies on the x-axis.
using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter to ﬁnd out
how to do the calculations and
the graph in part (a) using a 
TI-83/84 or Excel.

y-Intercept: c = 9
Symmetry: The graph is symmetric around the vertical line x = 3/2.
The graph is the narrow parabola shown in Figure 3. (As we remarked in Example 1,
plotting additional points and using symmetry helps us obtain an accurate 
sketch.)
b. Here, a = −1/2, b = 4, and c = −12. Because a < 0, the parabola is concave down.
The vertex has x-coordinate −b/(2a) = 4, with corresponding y-coordinate
f (4) = −1
2(4)2 + 4(4) −12 = −4. Thus, the vertex is at (4, −4).
For the x-intercepts, we must solve −1
2x2 + 4x −12 = 0. If we try to use the
quadratic formula, we discover that the discriminant is b2 −4ac = 16 −24 = −8.
Because the discriminant is negative, there are no solutions of the equation, so there
are no x-intercepts.
The y-intercept is given by c = −12, and the graph is symmetric around the
vertical line x = 4.
Because there are no x-intercepts, the graph lies entirely below the x-axis, as
shown in Figure 4. (Again, you should plot additional points and use symmetry to en-
sure that your sketch is accurate.)

Applications
Recall that the revenue resulting from one or more business transactions is the total
payment received. Thus, if q units of some item are sold at p dollars per unit, the revenue
resulting from the sale is
revenue = price × quantity
R = pq
Example 3 Demand and Revenue
Alien Publications, Inc., predicts that the demand equation for the sale of its latest illus-
trated sci-ﬁnovel Episode 93: Yoda vs. Alien is
q = −2000p + 150,000
where q is the number of books it can sell each year at a price of $p per book. What price
should Alien Publications, Inc., charge to obtain the maximum annual revenue?
Solution The total revenue depends on the price, as follows:
R = pq
= p(−2000p + 150,000)
= −2000p2 + 150,000p
We are after the price p that gives the maximum possible revenue. Notice that what we
have is a quadratic function of the form R( p) = ap2 + bp + c, where a = −2000,
b = 150,000, and c = 0. Because a is negative, the graph of the function is a parabola,
concave down, so its vertex is its highest point (Figure 5). The p-coordinate of the 
vertex is
p = −b
2a = −150,000
−4000 = 37.5
Formula for revenue
Substitute for q from demand equation.
Simplify.

This value of p gives the highest point on the graph and thus gives the largest value of
R( p). We may conclude that Alien Publications, Inc., should charge $37.50 per book to
maximize its annual revenue.

+Before we go on... You might ask what the maximum annual revenue is for the publisher
in Example 3. Because R( p) gives us the revenue at a price of $p, the answer is
R(37.5) = −2000(37.5)2+ 150,000(37.5) = 2,812,500. In other words, the company
will earn total annual revenues from this book amounting to $2,812,500. ■
Example 4 Demand, Revenue, and Profit
As the operator of Workout Fever Health Club, you calculate your demand equation
to be
q = −0.06p + 84
where q is the number of members in the club and p is the annual membership fee you
charge.
a. Your annual operating costs are a ﬁxed cost of $20,000 per year plus a variable cost
of $20 per member. Find the annual revenue and proﬁt as functions of the member-
ship price p.
b. At what price should you set the annual membership fee to obtain the maximum
revenue? What is the maximum possible revenue?
c. At what price should you set the annual membership fee to obtain the maximum
proﬁt? What is the maximum possible proﬁt? What is the corresponding revenue?
Solution
a. The annual revenue is given by
R = pq
= p(−0.06p + 84)
= −0.06p2 + 84p
Formula for revenue
Substitute for q from demand equation.
Simplify.

The annual cost C is given by
C = 20,000 + 20q
$20,000 plus $20 per member
However, this is a function of q, and not p. To express C as a function of p we substi-
tute for q using the demand equation q = −0.06p + 84:
C = 20,000 + 20(−0.06p + 84)
= 20,000 −1.2p + 1680
= −1.2p + 21,680
Thus, the proﬁt function is
P = R −C
= −0.06p2 + 84p −(−1.2p + 21,680)
= −0.06p2 + 85.2p −21,680
b. From part (a) the revenue function is given by
R = −0.06p2 + 84p
This is a quadratic function (a = −0.06, b = 84, c = 0) whose graph is a concave-
down parabola (Figure 6).
Formula for proﬁt
Substitute for revenue and cost.

c. From part (a), the proﬁt function is given by
P = −0.06p2 + 85.2p −21,680

Like the revenue function, the proﬁt function is quadratic (a = −0.06, b = 85.2,
c = −21,680). Figure 7 shows both the revenue and proﬁt functions.

+Before we go on... The result of part (c) of Example 4 tells us that the vertex of the
proﬁt curve in Figure 7 is slightly to the right of the vertex in the revenue curve. How-
ever, the difference is tiny compared to the scale of the graphs, so the graphs appear to
be parallel. ■
Q: Charging $710 membership brings in less revenue than charging $700. So why charge $710?
A: A membership fee of $700 does bring in slightly larger revenue than a fee of $710, but it
also brings in a slightly larger membership which in turn raises the operating expense and has
the effect of lowering the profit slightly (to $8560). In other words, the slightly higher fee,
while bringing in less revenue, also lowers the cost, and the net result is a larger profit. ■

set of points. The quadratic regression curve is the quadratic curve y = ax2 + bx + c
that best ﬁts the data points in the sense that the associated sum-of-squares error
(SSE—see Section 1.5) is a minimum. Although there are algebraic methods for ob-
taining the quadratic regression curve, it is normal to use technology to do this.

From the graph, we can see that the given data suggest a curve and not a straight line:
The observed points are above the regression line at the ends but below in the middle.
(We would expect the data points from a linear relation to fall randomly above and
below the regression line.)
b. The quadratic model that best ﬁts the data is the quadratic regression model. As with
linear regression, there are algebraic formulas to compute a, b, and c, but they are
rather involved. However, we exploit the fact that these formulas are built into

Notice from the graphs above that the quadratic regression model appears to give
a far better ﬁt than the linear regression model. This impression is supported by the
values of SSE. For the linear regression model, SSE ≈0.13. For the quadratic regres-
sion model, SSE is much smaller, approximately 0.03, indicating a much better ﬁt.

beast.net, where users must pay a small fee to log on. When
you charged $2 the demand was 280 log-ons per month.
When you lowered the price to $1.50, the demand increased
to 560 log-ons per month. hint [see Example 4]

center, but are not sure how much to charge. Sig Ep treasurer
Augustus recalls that they once sold 400 shirts in a week at
$8 per shirt, but Ep Sig treasurer Julius has solid research
indicating that it is possible to sell 600 per week at $4 per
shirt.
a. Based on this information, construct a linear demand
equation for Yoda vs. Alien T-shirts, and hence obtain the
weekly revenue R as a function of the unit price x.
b. The university administration charges the fraternities a
weekly fee of $500 for use of the Student Center. Write
down the monthly proﬁt P as a function of the unit price x,
and hence determine how much the fraternities should
charge to obtain the largest possible weekly proﬁt. What is

follows:
Site maintenance fee:
$20 per month
High-volume access fee:
50¢ per log-on
Find the monthly cost as a function of the log-on fee x.
Hence, ﬁnd the monthly proﬁt as a function of x and deter-

you charge $x per shirt. The Student Council charges you
$400 per week for use of their facilities, and the T-shirts cost
you $5 each. Find the weekly cost as a function of the unit
price x. Hence, ﬁnd the weekly proﬁt as a function of x and
determine the unit price you should charge to obtain the
largest possible weekly proﬁt. What is the largest possible
weekly proﬁt?

you charged $15 per guest and averaged 250 guests per
night.
a. Find a linear demand equation showing the number 
of guests q per night as a function of the cover 
charge p.
b. Find the nightly revenue R as a function of the cover
charge p.
c. The club will provide two free nonalcoholic drinks for
each guest, costing the club $3 per head. In addition, the
nightly overheads (rent, salaries, dancers, DJ, etc.) amount
to $3000. Find the cost C as a function of the cover
charge p.
d. Now ﬁnd the proﬁt in terms of the cover charge p, and
hence determine the cover charge you should charge for a
maximum proﬁt.
34. Television Advertising As Sales Manager for Montevideo
Productions, Inc., you are planning to review the prices you
charge clients for television advertisement development. You
currently charge each client an hourly development fee of
$2500. With this pricing structure, the demand, measured
by the number of contracts Montevideo signs per month, is
15 contracts. This is down 5 contracts from the ﬁgure last
year, when your company charged only $2000.
a. Construct a linear demand equation giving the number of
contracts q as a function of the hourly fee p Montevideo
charges for development.
b. On average, Montevideo bills for 50 hours of production
time on each contract. Give a formula for the total revenue
obtained by charging $p per hour
c. The costs to Montevideo Productions are estimated as
follows:
Fixed costs:
$120,000 per month
Variable costs:
$80,000 per contract
Express Montevideo Productions’ monthly cost (i) as a
function of the number q of contracts and (ii) as a function
of the hourly production charge p.

Exponential Functions and Models
The quadratic functions we discussed in Section 9.1 can be used to model many nonlin-
ear situations. However, exponential functions give better models in some applications,
including population growth, radioactive decay, the growth or depreciation of ﬁnancial
investments, and many other phenomena.
To work effectively with exponential functions, we need to know the laws of expo-
nents. The following list, similar to the one in the algebra review in Chapter 0, gives the
laws of exponents we will be using.

for every increase of 1 in x. If we decrease x by 1, the y-coordinate gets divided by 
b = 2.

One of these functions is linear, and the other is exponential. Which is which?
Solution
Remember that a linear function increases (or decreases) by the same amount every time
x increases by 1. The values of f behave this way: Every time x increases by 1, the value
of f (x) increases by 4. Therefore, f is a linear function with a slope of 4. Since
f (0) = 1, we see that
f (x) = 4x + 1
is a linear formula that ﬁts the data.
On the other hand, every time x increases by 1, the value of g(x) is multiplied by 3.
Since g(0) = 2, we ﬁnd that
g(x) = 2(3x)
is an exponential function ﬁtting the data.
We can visualize the two functions f and g by plotting the data points (Figure 11).
The data points for f (x) clearly lie along a straight line, whereas the points for g(x) lie
along a curve, as shown in the graph on the right. The y-coordinate of each point for
g(x) is three times the y-coordinate of the preceding point, demonstrating that the curve
is an exponential one.

Example 2 Finding the Exponential Curve through Two Points
Find an equation of the exponential curve through (1, 6) and (3, 24).
Solution
We want an equation of the form
y = Abx
(b > 0)
Substituting the coordinates of the given points, we get
6 = Ab1
Substitute (1, 6).
24 = Ab3
Substitute (3, 24).
If we now divide the second equation by the ﬁrst, we get
24
6 = Ab3
Ab = b2
b2 = 4
b = 2
b is positive in an exponential function
Now that we have b, we can substitute its value into the ﬁrst equation to obtain
6 = 2A
Substitute b  2 into the equation 6  Ab.
A = 3
We have both constants, A = 3 and b = 2, so the model is
y = 3(2x)
Example 7 will show how to use technology to ﬁt an exponential function to two or
more data points.
Applications
Recall some terminology we mentioned earlier: A quantity y experiences exponential
growth if y = Abt with b > 1. (Here we use t for the independent variable, thinking of
time.) It experiences exponential decay if y = Abt with 0 < b < 1. Here we discuss
examples of the numerous applications of exponential growth and decay. Our ﬁrst
application is to public health.
Example 3 Exponential Growth: Epidemics
In the early stages of the AIDS epidemic during the 1980s, the number of cases in the
U.S. was increasing by about 50% every six months. By the start of 1983, there were ap-
proximately 1600 AIDS cases in the U.S.*

9.2 Exponential Functions and Models

a. Assuming an exponential growth model, ﬁnd a function that predicts the number of
people infected t years after the start of 1983.
b. Use the model to estimate the number of people infected by October 1, 1986, and also
by the end of that year.
Solution
a. One way of ﬁnding the desired exponential function is to reason as follows: At time
t = 0 (January 1, 1983), the number of people infected was 1600, so A = 1600.
Every six months, the number of cases increased to 150% of the number six months
earlier—that is, to 1.50 times that number. Each year, it therefore increased to
(1.50)2 = 2.25 times the number one year earlier. Hence, after t years, we need to
multiply the original 1600 by 2.25t, so the model is
y = 1600(2.25t) cases
Alternatively, if we wish to use the method of Example 2, we need two data points. We
are given one point: (0, 1600). Since y increased by 50% every six months, six months
later it reached 1600 + 800 = 2400 (t = 0.5). This information gives a second point:
(0.5, 2400). We can now apply the method in Example 2 to ﬁnd the model above.
b. October 1, 1986, corresponds to t = 3.75 (because October 1 is 9 months, or
9/12 = 0.75 of a year after January 1). Substituting this value of t in the model gives
y = 1600(2.253.75) ≈33,481 cases
1600*2.25^3.75
By the end of 1986, the model predicts that
y = 1600(2.254) = 41,006 cases
(The actual number of cases was around 41,700.)
Before we go on... Increasing the number of cases by 50% every six months couldn’t
continue for very long and this is borne out by observations. If increasing by 50% every
six months did continue, then by January 2003 (t = 20), the number of infected people
would have been
1600(2.2520) ≈17,700,000,000
a number that is more than 50 times the size of the U.S. population! Thus, although the
exponential model is fairly reliable in the early stages of the epidemic, it is unreliable for
predicting long-term trends. ■
Epidemiologists use more sophisticated models to measure the spread of epi-
demics, and these models predict a leveling-off phenomenon as the number of cases be-
comes a signiﬁcant part of the total population. We discuss such a model, the logistic
function, in Section 9.4.
Exponential functions arise in ﬁnance and economics mainly through the idea of
compound interest. Suppose you invest $500 (the present value) in an investment ac-
count with an annual yield of 15%, and the interest is reinvested at the end of every year
(we say that the interest is compounded once a year). Let t represent the number of
years since you made the initial $500 investment. Each year, the investment is worth
115% (or 1.15 times) its value the previous year. The future value A of your investment

A special case is interest compounded once a year:
A(t) = P(1 + r)t
If $2000 is invested for two and a half years in a mutual fund with an annual yield of
12.6% and the earnings are reinvested each month, then P = 2000, r = 0.126, m = 12,
and t = 2.5, which gives
A(2.5) = 2000

how we can calculate the future value for several values of t:

Thus, A(t) = 500(1.15)t. A traditional way to write this formula is
A(t) = P(1 + r)t
where P is the present value (P = 500) and r is the annual interest rate (r = 0.15).
If, instead of compounding the interest once a year, we compound it every three
months (four times a year), we would earn one quarter of the interest (r/4 of the current
investment) every three months. Because this would happen 4t times in t years, the for-
mula for the future value becomes

This is the exponential model. (What would happen if we left out the last set of paren-
theses in the technology formula?)
b. We need to ﬁnd the value of t for which A(t) = $5000, so we need to solve the equation
5000 = 2000(1.0105)12t

Because the balance ﬁrst exceeds $5000 in year 8, the answer is t = 8 years.
Carbon-14, an unstable isotope of carbon, decays exponentially to nitrogen. Because
carbon-14 decay is extremely slow, it has important applications in the dating of fossils.
Example 5 Exponential Decay: Carbon Dating
The amount of carbon-14 remaining in a sample that originally contained A grams is
approximately
C(t) = A(0.999879)t
where t is time in years. A fossilized plant unearthed in an archaeological dig contains
0.50 gram of carbon-14 and is known to be 50,000 years old. How much carbon-14 did
the plant originally contain?
Solution We are given the following information: C = 0.50, A = the unknown, and
t = 50,000. Substituting gives
0.50 = A(0.999879)50,000

Chapter 9
Nonlinear Models
Solving for A gives
A =
0.5
0.99987950,000 ≈212 grams
Thus, the plant originally contained 212 grams of carbon-14.
Before we go on... The formula we used for A in Example 5 has the form
A(t) =
C
0.999879t
which gives the original amount of carbon-14 t years ago in terms of the amount C that
is left now. A similar formula can be used in ﬁnance to ﬁnd the present value, given the
future value. ■
The Number e and More Applications
In nature we ﬁnd examples of growth that occurs continuously, as though “interest” is
being added more often than every second or fraction of a second. To model this, we
need to see what happens to our compound interest formula as we let m (the number of
times interest is added per year) become extremely large. Something very interesting
does happen: we end up with a more compact and elegant formula than we began with.
To see why, let’s look at a very simple situation.
Suppose we invest $1 in the bank for 1 year at 100% interest, compounded m times
per year. If m = 1, then 100% interest is added every year, and so our money doubles at
the end of the year. In general, the accumulated capital at the end of the year is
A = 1

Something interesting does seem to be happening! The numbers appear to be getting
closer and closer to a speciﬁc value. In mathematical terminology, we say that the

quantities 

1 + 1

m. This number, called e, is one of the most important in mathemat-
ics. The number e is irrational, just as the more familiar number π is, so we cannot write
down its exact numerical value. To 20 decimal places,
e = 2.71828182845904523536. . . .
We now say that, if $1 is invested for 1 year at 100% interest compounded contin-
uously, the accumulated money at the end of that year will amount to $e = $2.72 (to the
nearest cent). But what about the following more general question?
Q: What about a more general scenario: If we invest an amount $P for t years at an interest
rate of r, compounded continuously, what will be the accumulated amount A at the end of that
period?
A: In the special case above, (P, t, and r all equal to 1) we took the compound interest formula
and let m get larger and larger. We do the same more generally, after a little preliminary work
with the algebra of exponentials.

A: On the TI-83/84, enter ex as e^(x), where e^( can be obtained by pressing

Q: How does continuous compounding compare with monthly compounding?
A: To repeat the calculation in part (a) of Example 6 using monthly compounding instead of
continuous compounding, we use the compound interest formula with P = 10,000, r = 0.06,
m = 12, and t = 5 and find
A(5) = 10,000(1 + 0.06/12)60 ≈$13,488.50
Thus, continuous compounding earns you approximately $10 more than monthly compounding
on a five-year, $10,000 investment. This is little to get excited about. ■

quick Examples 1. If $100 is invested in an account that bears 15% interest compounded continuously, at
the end of 10 years the investment will be worth
A(10) = 100e(0.15)(10) = $448.17 100*e^(0.15*10) or 100*EXP(0.15*10)
2. If $1 is invested in an account that bears 100% interest compounded continuously, at
the end of x years, the investment will be worth
A(x) = exdollars
Example 6 Continuous Compounding
a. You invest $10,000 at Fastrack Savings & Loan, which pays 6% compounded con-
tinuously. Express the balance in your account as a function of the number of years t
and calculate the amount of money you will have after ﬁve years.
b. Your friend has just invested $10,000 in Constant Growth Funds, whose stocks are
continuously declining at a rate of 6% per year. How much will her investment be
worth in ﬁve years?
Solution
a. We use the continuous growth formula with P = 10,000, r = 0.06, and t variable,
getting
A(t) = Pert = 10,000e0.06t
In ﬁve years,
A(5) = 10,000e0.06(5)
= 10,000e0.3
≈$13,498.59
b. Because the investment is depreciating, we use a negative value for r and take
P = 10,000, r = −0.06, and t = 5, getting
A(t) = Pert = 10,000e−0.06t
A(5) = 10,000e−0.06(5)
= 10,000e−0.3
≈$7408.18

9.2 Exponential Functions and Models
639
If we write the continuous compounding formula A(t) = Pert as A(t) = P(er)t,
we see that A(t) is an exponential function of t, where the base is b = er, so we have
really not introduced a new kind of function. In fact, exponential functions are often
written in this way:
quick Examples
Exponential Functions: Alternative Form
We can write any exponential function in the following alternative form:
f (x) = Aerx
where A and r are constants. If r is positive, f models exponential growth; if r is nega-
tive, f models exponential decay.

Exponential Regression
Starting with a set of data that suggests an exponential curve, we can use technology to
compute the exponential regression curve in much the same way as we did for the qua-
dratic regression curve in Example 5 of Section 9.1.

2010 (t = 0 represents 1980).*

b. Use the regression model to estimate the expenditure in 2002 (t = 22; the actual ex-
penditure was approximately $1550 billion).

FAQs
When to Use an Exponential Model for Data Points, and When to
Use e in Your Model
Q: Given a set of data points that appear to be curving upwards, how can I tell whether to use a
quadratic model or an exponential model?
A: Here are some things to look for:
• Do the data values appear to double at regular intervals? (For example, do the values approxi-
mately double every five units?) If so, then an exponential model is appropriate. If it takes
longer and longer to double, then a quadratic model may be more appropriate.
• Do the values first decrease to a low point and then increase? If so, then a quadratic model is
more appropriate.
It is also helpful to use technology to graph both the regression quadratic and exponential
curves and to visually inspect the graphs to determine which gives the closest fit to the data. ■
b. Using the model C(t) ≈282.33(1.0808)t we ﬁnd that
C(22) ≈282.33(1.0808)22 ≈$1560 billion
which is close to the actual number of around $1550 billion.
Before we go on... We said in the preceding section that the regression curve gives the
smallest value of the sum-of-squares error, SSE (the sum of the squares of the residu-
als). However, exponential regression as computed via technology generally minimizes
the sum of the squares of the residuals of the logarithms (logarithms are discussed in the
next section). Using logarithms allows one easily to convert an exponential function into
a linear one and then use linear regression formulas. However, in Section 9.4, we will
discuss a way of using Excel’s Solver to minimize SSE directly, which allows us to ﬁnd
the best-ﬁt exponential curve directly without the need for devices to simplify the math-
ematics. If we do this, we obtain a very different equation:
C(t) ≈316.79(1.0747t)
If you plot this function, you will notice that it seems to ﬁt the data more closely than the
regression curve. ■

Q: We have two ways of writing exponential functions: f(x) = Abx and f(x) = Aerx. How do
we know which one to use?
A: The two forms are equivalent, and it is always possible to convert from one form to the
other.* So, use whichever form seems to be convenient for a particular situation. For instance,
f(t) = A(3t) conveniently models exponential growth that is tripling every unit of time, whereas
f(t) = Ae0.06t conveniently models an investment with continuous compounding at 6%. ■

9.3 Logarithmic Functions and Models

9.3 Logarithmic Functions and Models
Logarithms were invented by John Napier (1550–1617) in the late 16th century as a
means of aiding calculation. His invention made possible the prodigious hand calcula-
tions of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), who was the ﬁrst to describe accu-
rately the orbits and the motions of the planets. Today, computers and calculators have
done away with that use of logarithms, but many other uses remain. In particular, the
logarithm is used to model real-world phenomena in numerous ﬁelds, including physics,
ﬁnance, and economics.
From the equation
23 = 8
we can see that the power to which we need to raise 2 in order to get 8 is 3. We abbrevi-
ate the phrase “the power to which we need to raise 2 in order to get 8” as “log2 8.” Thus,
another way of writing the equation 23 = 8 is
log2 8 = 3
The power to which we need to raise 2 in order to get 8 is 3.
This is read “the base 2 logarithm of 8 is 3” or “the log, base 2, of 8 is 3.”
Here is the general deﬁnition.
quick Examples
Base b Logarithm
The base b logarithm of x, logb x, is the power to which we need to raise b in order to
get x. Symbolically,
logb x = y
means
by = x

Exponential form
1. The following table lists some exponential equations and their equivalent logarithmic
forms:
2. log3 9 = the power to which we need to raise 3 in order to get 9. Because 32 = 9, this
power is 2, so log3 9 = 2.
3. log1010,000 = the power to which we need to raise 10 in order to get 10,000. Because
104 = 10,000, this power is 4, so log1010,000 = 4.
4. log3
1
27 is the power to which we need to raise 3 in order to get 1
27. Because 3−3 =
1
27
this power is –3, so log3

27 = −3.
5. logb1 = 0 for every positive number b other than 1 because b0 = 1.
103. ● How would you check whether data points of the form
(1, y1), (2, y2), (3, y3) lie on an exponential curve?
104. You are told that the points (1, y1), (2, y2), (3, y3) lie on an
exponential curve. Express y3 in terms of y1 and y2.
105. Your local banker tells you that the reason his bank doesn’t

To compute logb x using technology, use the following formulas:
TI-83:
log(x)/log(b)
Example: log2(16) is log(16)/log(2)
Excel:
=LOG(x,b)
Example: log2(16) is = LOG(16,2)
* Here is a quick explanation of why this formula works: To calculate logb a, we ask, “to what power must we
raise b to get a?” To check the formula, we try using log a/log b as the exponent.
b
log a
log b = (10log b)
log a
log b
(because b = 10log b)
= 10log a = a
so this exponent works!
Note The number logb x is deﬁned only if b and x are both positive and b ̸= 1. Thus, it
is impossible to compute, say, log3(−9) (because there is no power of 3 that equals −9),
or log1(2) (because there is no power of 1 that equals 2). ■
Logarithms with base 10 and base e are frequently used, so they have special names
and notations.

Solve the following equations
a. 5−x = 125
b. 32x−1 = 6
c. 100(1.005)3x = 200
Solution
a. Write the given equation 5−x = 125 in logarithmic form:
−x = log5 125
This gives x = −log5 125 = −3.
b. In logarithmic form, 32x−1 = 6 becomes

x = 1 + log3 6

Logarithmic Function
A logarithmic function has the form
f (x) = logb x + C
(b and C are constants with b > 0, b ̸= 1)
or, alternatively,
f (x) = A ln x + C
(A, C constants with A ̸= 0)
1. f (x) = log x
2. g(x) = ln x −5
3. h(x) = log2 x + 1

b. Use technology to compare the graph in part (a) with the graphs of logb x for

Solution
a. To sketch the graph of f (x) = log2 x by hand, we begin with a table of values.
Because log2 x is not deﬁned when x = 0, we choose several values of x close to
zero and also some larger values, all chosen so that their logarithms are easy to
compute:
Graphing these points and joining them by a smooth curve gives us Figure 14.

+Before we go on... Notice that the graphs of the logarithmic functions in Example 2 all
pass through the point (1, 0). (Why?) Notice further that the graphs of the logarithmic
functions with bases less than 1 are upside-down versions of the others. Finally, how are
these graphs related to the graphs of exponential functions? ■
Q: What is the difference between the two forms of the logarithmic function?
A: None, really, they’re equivalent: We can start with an equation in the first form and use the
change-of-base formula to rewrite it:
f (x) = logb x + C
= ln x
ln b + C
Change-of-base formula

Our function now has the form f(x) = A ln x + C , where A = 1/ ln b. We can go the other way
as well, to rewrite A ln x + C in the form logb x + C . ■

Relationship with Exponential Functions
The following two identities demonstrate that the operations of taking the base b loga-
rithm and raising b to a power are “inverse” to each other.*

Quick Example
1. logb(bx) = x
log2(27) = 7
In words: The power to which you raise b in order to get bx is x (!)
2. blogb x = x
5log5 8 = 8
In words: Raising b to the power to which it must be raised to get x, yields x (!)

Example 3 Investments: How Long?
Ten-year government bonds in Italy are yielding an average of 5.2% per year.* At that
interest rate, how long will it take a €1000 investment to be worth €1500 if the interest
is compounded monthly?
Solution Substituting A = 1500, P = 1000, r = 0.052, and m = 12 in the compound
interest equation gives

Chapter 9
Nonlinear Models
and we must solve for t. We ﬁrst divide both sides by 1000, getting an equation in expo-
nential form:
1.5 = 1.00433312t
In logarithmic form, this becomes
12t = log1.004333(1.5)
We can now solve for t:
t = log1.004333(1.5)
12
≈7.8 years
log(1.5)/(log(1.004333)*12)
Thus, it will take approximately 7.8 years for a €1000 investment to be worth €1500.
Example 4 Half-Life
a. The weight of carbon-14 that remains in a sample that originally contained A grams
is given by
C(t) = A(0.999879)t
where t is time in years. Find the half-life, the time it takes half of the carbon-14 in a
sample to decay.
b. Repeat part (a) using the following alternative form of the exponential model in
part (a):
C(t) = Ae−0.000 121 01t 
See p. 639.
c. Another radioactive material has a half-life of 7000 years. Find an exponential
decay model in the form
R(t) = Ae−kt
for the amount of undecayed material remaining. (The constant k is called the decay
constant.)
d. How long will it take for 99.95% of the substance in a sample of the material in
part (c) to decay?
Solution
a. We want to ﬁnd the value of t for which C(t) = the weight of undecayed carbon-14
left  half the original weight = 0.5A. Substituting, we get
0.5A = A(0.999879)t
Dividing both sides by A gives
0.5 = 0.999879t
Exponential form
t = log0.999879 0.5 ≈5728 years
Logarithmic form
b. This is similar to part (a): We want to solve the equation
0.5A = Ae−0.000 121 01t
for t. Dividing both sides by A gives
0.5 = e−0.000 121 01t

9.3 Logarithmic Functions and Models
651
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives
ln(0.5) = ln(e−0.000 121 01t) = −0.000 121 01t
ln(ea) = a ln e = a
t =
ln(0.5)
−0.000 121 01 ≈5728 years
as we obtained in part (a).
c. This time we are given the half-life, which we can use to ﬁnd the exponential model
R(t) = Ae−kt. At time t = 0, the amount of radioactive material is
R(0) = Ae0 = A
Because half of the sample decays in 7000 years, this sample will decay to 0.5A
grams in 7000 years (t = 7000). Substituting this information gives
0.5A = Ae−k(7000)
Canceling A and taking natural logarithms gives
ln(0.5) = −7000k
so the decay constant k is
k = −ln(0.5)
7000 ≈0.000 099 021
Therefore, the model is
R(t) = Ae−0.000 099 021t
d. If 99.95% of the substance in a sample has decayed, then the amount of undecayed
material left is 0.05% of the original amount  0.0005A. We have
0.0005A = Ae−0.000 099 021t
0.0005 = e−0.000 099 021t
ln(0.0005) = −0.000 099 021t
t =
ln(0.0005)
−0.000 099 021 ≈76,760 years
+Before we go on...
Q: In parts (a) and (b) of Example 4 we were given two different forms of the model for 
carbon-14 decay. How do we convert an exponential function in one form to the other?
A: We have already seen (See Quick Example 3 on p. 639) how to convert from the form
f(t) = Aert in part (b) to the form f(t) = Abt in part (a). To go the other way, start with the
model in part (a), and equate it to the desired form:
C(t) = A(0.999 879)t = Ae rt
To solve for r, cancel the As and take the natural logarithm of both sides:
t ln(0.999 879) = rt ln e = rt
so
r = ln(0.999 879) ≈−0.000 121 01
giving
C(t) = Ae−0.000 121 01t
as in part (b). ■

Logarithmic Regression
If we start with a set of data that suggests a logarithmic curve we can, by repeating the
methods from previous sections, use technology to ﬁnd the logarithmic regression curve
y = logb x + C approximating the data.
We can use the work we did in parts (b) and (c) of the above example to obtain a for-
mula for the decay constant in an exponential decay model for any radioactive substance
when we know its half-life. Write the half-life as th. Then the calculation in part (b) gives
k = −ln(0.5)
th

Exponential Decay Model and Half-Life
An exponential decay function has the form
Q(t) = Q0e−kt
Q0, k both positive
Q0 represents the value of Q at time t = 0, and k is the decay constant. The decay con-
stant k and half-life th for Q are related by
thk = ln 2
1. Q(t) = Q0e−0.000 121 01t is the decay function for carbon-14 (see Example 4b).
2. If th = 10 years, then 10k = ln 2, so k = ln 2
10 ≈0.06931 so the decay model is
Q(t) = Q0e−0.06931t
3. If k = 0.0123, then th(0.0123) = ln 2, so the half-life is th =
ln 2
0.0123 ≈56.35 years.

Exponential Growth Model and Doubling Time
An exponential growth function has the form
Q(t) = Q0ekt
Q0, k both positive
Q0 represents the value of Q at time t = 0, and k is the growth constant. The growth
constant k and doubling time td for Q are related by
tdk = ln 2
1. P(t) = 1000e0.05t
$1000 invested at 5% annually with interest compounded continuously
2. If td = 10 years, then 10k = ln 2, so k = ln 2
10 ≈0.06931 so the growth model is
Q(t) = Q0e0.06931t
3. If k = 0.0123, then td(0.0123) = ln 2, so the doubling time is td =
ln 2
0.0123 ≈56.35
years.
We can repeat the analysis above for exponential growth models:

and use the model to project total spending on research in 2010, assuming the trend
continues.
Solution
We use technology to get the following regression model:
S(t) = 73.77 ln t + 67.75
Coefﬁcients rounded
Because 2010 is represented by t = 20, we have
S(20) = 73.77 ln(20) + 67.75 ≈289
Why did we round the result to three 
signiﬁcant digits?
So, research and development spending is predicted to be around $289 billion in 2010.

30 A mole corresponds to about 6.0 × 1023 hydrogen ions. (This number
is known as Avogadro’s number.)

The left-hand part of the curve in Figure 17, from t = 0 to, say, t = 4, looks like
exponential growth: P behaves (roughly) like an exponential function, growing at a rate
of around 15% per year. Then, as the market starts to become saturated, the growth of P
slows and its value approaches a “saturation” point. Logistic functions have just this
kind of behavior, growing exponentially at ﬁrst and then leveling off. In addition to
modeling the demand for a new technology or product, logistic functions are often used
in epidemic and population modeling. In an epidemic, the number of infected people
often grows exponentially at ﬁrst and then slows when a signiﬁcant proportion of the en-
tire susceptible population is infected and the epidemic has “run its course.” Similarly,
populations may grow exponentially at ﬁrst and then slow as they approach the capacity
of the available resources.

the logistic function:
f (x) =

bottom by bx:
f (x) =
N
1 + Ab−x
=
Nbx
(1 + Ab−x)bx
=
Nbx
bx + A
Because b−xbx = 1
For values of x close to 0, the quantity bx is close to 1, so the denominator is approximately
1 + A, giving
f (x) ≈Nbx
1 + A =

In other words, f (x) is approximately exponential with base b for values of x close to 0.
Put another way, if x represents time, then initially the logistic function behaves like an
exponential function.

Modeling with the Logistic Function
Example 1 Epidemics
A ﬂu epidemic is spreading through the U.S. population. An estimated 150 million peo-
ple are susceptible to this particular strain, and it is predicted that all susceptible people
will eventually become infected. There are 10,000 people already infected, and the num-
ber is doubling every two weeks. Use a logistic function to model the number of people
infected. Hence predict when, to the nearest week, 1 million people will be infected.
Solution Let t be time in weeks, and let P(t) be the total number of people infected at
time t. We want to express P as a logistic function of t, so that
P(t) =
N
1 + Ab−t
We are told that, in the long run, 150 million people will be infected, so that
N = 150,000,000
Limiting value of P
At the current time (t = 0), 10,000 people are infected, so
10,000 =
N
1 + A = 150,000,000
1 + A
Value of P when t = 0

9.4 Logistic Functions and Models
661
Solving for A gives
10,000(1 + A) = 150,000,000
1 + A = 15,000
A = 14,999
What about b? At the beginning of the epidemic (t near 0), P is growing approximately
exponentially, doubling every two weeks. Using the technique of Section 9.2, we ﬁnd
that the exponential curve passing through the points (0, 10,000) and (2, 20,000) is
y = 10,000(
√
2)t
giving us b =
√
2. Now that we have the constants N, A, and b, we can write down the
logistic model:
P(t) =
150,000,000
1 + 14,999(
√
2)−t
The graph of this function is shown in Figure 18.
Now we tackle the question of prediction: When will 1 million people be infected?
In other words: When is P(t) = 1,000,000?
1,000,000 =
150,000,000
1 + 14,999(
√
2)−t
1,000,000[1 + 14,999(

Logistic Regression
Let us go back to the data on the percentage of households with PCs and try to estimate
the percentage of households that will have PCs in the long term. In order to be able to
make predictions such as this, we require a model for the data, so we will need to do
some form of regression.

using Technology
See the Technology Guides at
the end of the chapter for 
detailed instructions on using a
TI-83/84 or Excel to ﬁnd logistic
regression curves.
Note Logistic regression estimates all three constants N, A, and b for a model
y =
N
1 + Ab−x . However, there are times, as in Example 1, when we already know the 
limiting value N and require estimates of only A and b. In such cases, we can use expo-
nential regression to compute these estimates: First rewrite the logistic equation as
N
y = 1 + Ab−x
so that
N
y −1 = Ab−x = A(b−1)x
This equation gives N/y −1 as an exponential function of x. Thus, if we do exponential
regression using the data points (x, N/y −1), we can obtain estimates for A and
b−1 (and hence b). This is done in Exercises 33 and 34. ■

Applications
37. Website Trafﬁc The daily trafﬁc (“hits per day”) at 
OHaganBooks.com seems to depend on the monthly expendi-
ture on advertising through banner ads on well-known Inter-
net portals. The following model, based on information you
have collected over the past few months, shows the approxi-
mate relationship:
h = −0.000005c2 + 0.085c + 1750
where h is the average number of hits per day at 
OHaganBooks.com, and c
is the monthly advertising
expenditure.
a. According to the model, what monthly advertising
expenditure will result in the largest volume of trafﬁc at
OHaganBooks.com? What is that volume?
b. In addition to predicting a maximum volume of trafﬁc, the
model predicts that the trafﬁc will eventually drop to zero if
the advertising expenditure is increased too far. What expen-
diture (to the nearest dollar) results in no website trafﬁc?
c. What feature of the formula for this quadratic model indi-
cates that it will predict an eventual decline in trafﬁc as
advertising expenditure increases?
38. Broadband Access Pablo Pelogrande, a new summer intern at
OHaganBooks.com, argues that broadband access to the
Internet is increasing as a rate that justiﬁes the website up-
grades (video and audio content for broadband) that the com-
pany is planning: indeed the rate of growth of broadband was
approximately n(t) = 2t2 −2t + 8 million new American
adults with broadband per year, where t is time in years since
the beginning of 2001.42
a. According to the model, when was the rate of growth at a
minimum?
b. Does the model predict a zero rate of growth at any
particular time? If so, when?

the number of broadband users actually declined in early
2001? Explain.
39. Revenue Some time ago, you formulated the following linear
model of demand:
q = −60p + 950
where q is the monthly demand for OHaganBooks.com’s on-
line novels at a price of p dollars per novel. Use this model to
express the monthly revenue as a function of the unit price p,
and hence determine the price you should charge for a maxi-
mum monthly revenue.
40. Proﬁt Refer to the linear demand model in Exercise 39 for
online novels. Author royalties and copyright fees cost the
company an average of $4 per novel, and the monthly cost of
operating and maintaining the online publishing service
amounts to $900 per month. Express the monthly proﬁt P as a
function of the unit price p, and hence determine the unit
price you should charge for a maximum monthly proﬁt. What
is the resulting proﬁt (or loss)?
41. Lobsters Marjory Dufﬁn is particularly fond of having
steamed lobster at working lunches with executives from
OHaganBooks.com, and is therefore alarmed by the news that
the yearly lobster harvest from New York’s Long Island Sound
has been decreasing dramatically since 1997. Indeed, the size
of the annual harvest can be approximated by
n(t) = 10(0.66t) million pounds
where t is time in years since June, 1997.43
a. The model tells us that the harvest was ____ million
pounds in 1997 and decreasing by ___% each 
year.
b. What does the model predict for the 2005 harvest?
42.Stock Prices In the period immediately following its initial
public offering (IPO), OHaganBooks.com’s stock is doubling
in value every three hours. If you bought $10,000 worth of the
stock when it was ﬁrst offered, how much was your stock
worth after eight hours?
43.Lobsters (See Exercise 41.) Marjory Dufﬁn has just left John
O’Hagan, CEO of OHaganBooks.com, a frantic phone mes-
sage to the effect that yearly lobster harvest from New York’s
Long Island Sound has just dipped below 100,000 pounds,
making that planned lobster working lunch more urgent than
ever. What year is it?
44. Stock Prices We saw in Exercise 42 that OHaganBooks.com’s
stock was doubling in value every three hours, following its
IPO. If you bought $10,000 worth of the stock when it was ﬁrst
offered, how long from the initial offering did it take your in-
vestment to reach $50,000?
45. Stock Prices We saw in Exercise 42 that OHaganBooks.com’s
stock was doubling in value every three hours, following its
IPO. After 10 hours of trading, the stock turns around and
starts losing one third of its value every four hours. How long
(from the initial offering) will it be before your stock is once
again worth $10,000?
46.
Ex Lobsters The model in Exercise 41 was based on
the data shown in the following chart:
Yearly Lobster Harvest from Long Island Sound
Use the data to obtain an exponential regression curve of the
form n(t) = Abt, with t = 0 corresponding to 1997 and
coefﬁcients rounded to two signiﬁcant digits.
47.Hardware Life (Based on a question from the GRE economics
exam) To estimate the rate at which new computer hard drives
will have to be retired, OHaganBooks.com uses the “survivor
curve”:
Lx = L0e−x/t
where
Lx  number of surviving hard drives at age x
L0  number of hard drives initially
t  average life in years
All of the following are implied by the curve except:
(A) Some of the equipment is retired during the ﬁrst year of
service.
(B) Some equipment survives three average lives.
(C) More than half the equipment survives the average 
life.
(D) Increasing the average life of equipment by using more
durable materials would increase the number surviving at
every age.
(E) The number of survivors never reaches zero.

In 1798 Thomas R. Malthus (1766–1834) published
an inﬂuential pamphlet, later expanded into a book,
titled An Essay on the Principle of Population As It
Affects the Future Improvement of Society. One of
his main contentions was that population grows
geometrically (exponentially) while the supply of
resources such as food grows only arithmetically
(linearly).This led him to the pessimistic conclusion
that population would always reach the limits of sub-
sistence and precipitate famine, war, and ill-health,
unless population could be checked by other means. He advocated “moral restraint,”
which includes the pattern of late marriage common in Western Europe at the time and is
now common in most developed countries, and which leads to a lower reproduction rate.
Two hundred years later, you have been asked to check the validity of Malthus’s con-
tention. That population grows geometrically, at least over short periods of time, is com-
monly assumed. That resources grow linearly is more questionable. You decide to check
the actual production of a common crop, wheat, in the United States. Agricultural statis-
tics like these are available from the U.S. government on the Internet, through the U.S.
Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). As of 2006,
this service was available at http://www.nass.usda.gov/. Looking through this site, you
locate data on the annual production of all wheat in the U.S. from 1866 through 2001.
Park Street/PhotoEdit

This does not look very linear, particularly in the last half of the 20th century, but you
continue checking the mathematics. Using Excel’s built-in linear regression capabilities,
you ﬁnd that the line that best ﬁts these data, shown in Figure 21, has r2 = 0.8002.
(Recall the discussion of the correlation coefﬁcient r in Section 1.5. A similar statistic is
available for other types of regression as well.)

Although that is a fairly high correlation, you notice that the residuals are not distributed
randomly: The actual wheat production starts out higher than the line, is below the line
from about 1920 to about 1970, and then is mostly above the line. This suggests that
you would get a better ﬁt from a function whose graph bends upwards. But what kind
of curve? You decide to compare three different models: quadratic, exponential, and
logistic.
Following is a comparison of the results of ﬁtting the three proposed models.
(Coefﬁcients are rounded to six signiﬁcant digits. SSE is the sum-of-squares error and
r2 is called the coefﬁcient of determination, and measures how closely the regression
curve ﬁts the data.)

Q: Because the quadratic model gives a slightly higher value for r2, it follows that the quadratic
model is more appropriate than the exponential model, right?
A: The quadratic model does give a better fit to the data than the exponential model (as
evidenced by the values of both SSE and r2). However, a better fit does not necessarily imply a
more appropriate model. ■
Q: Why not?
A: Suppose, for arguments’ sake, that production of wheat was growing exponentially accord-
ing to the above regression model on average, but that due to random fluctuations in market
conditions and weather patterns, the actual output varied from the predicted output by a
random amount. This randomness would explain the fact that the observed values do not lie
exactly on the regression curve, but are instead scattered about in its vicinity. Moreover, because
the scatter is due to random factors, any attempt to obtain a mathematical curve that fits the
actual data more closely would be questionable, given our assumption. (For example, we could
find a degree 99 polynomial whose graph passes through every data point!) ■
Q: Could you not then argue that the linear model might be the most appropriate of all three,
and that the illusion of curvature is caused by those same random fluctuations?
A: That could conceivably be happening, but two factors argue against it: First, the positive-
negative-positive pattern of the residuals in the linear model (Figure 21) strongly suggest that
something other than a linear relationship is going on. Second (and we will be vague here)
there are rigorous statistical tests one can perform to support the hypothesis that there is
curvature.44 ■
Although neither the quadratic nor the exponential model has a clear advantage
over the other, the good ﬁt of both models provides reasonable evidence that wheat pro-
duction, at least, is better described as increasing quadratically or exponentially than
linearly, contradicting Malthus.

If you compare the exponential and logistic models, you get additional interesting
information. The logistic model seems as though it ought to be the most appropriate,
because wheat production cannot reasonably be expected to continue increasing
exponentially forever; eventually resource limitations must lead to a leveling-off of
wheat production. Such a leveling off, if it occurred before the population started to
level off, would seem to vindicate Malthus’s pessimistic predictions.45
However, the logistic regression model looks suspect: It predicts a leveling-off
value (N) that is orders of magnitude higher than what seems reasonable. Moreover, the
logistic model (as well as SSE and r2) looks almost indistinguishable from the expo-
nential model, suggesting that it is no better. You are forced to conclude that wheat
production—even if it is logistic—is still in the early (exponential) stage of growth, and
thus shows no sign, as yet, of leveling off. In general, for a logistic model to be reliable
in its prediction of the leveling-off value N, we would need to see signiﬁcant evidence of
leveling-off in the data.
You tentatively conclude that wheat production for the past 100 years is better de-
scribed as increasing quadratically or exponentially than linearly, contradicting Malthus,
and moreover that it shows no sign of leveling off as yet.

Because both intercepts agree, we conclude that the graph
intersects the x-axis on a single point (at the vertex).
6. To graph the function, we need to select good values for
Xmin and Xmax. In general, we would like our graph to
show the vertex as well as all the intercepts. To see the
vertex, make sure that its x-coordinate (1.5) is between
Xmin and Xmax. To see the x-intercepts, make sure that
they are also between Xmin and Xmax (also 1.5). To see
the y-intercept, make sure that x = 0 is between Xmin
and Xmax. Thus, to see everything, choose Xmin and
Xmax so that the interval [xMin, xMax] contains the 
x-coordinate of the vertex, the x-intercepts, and 0. For
this example, we can choose an interval like [−1, 3].
7. Once xMin and xMax are chosen, you can obtain conve-
nient values of yMin and yMax by pressing 
and
selecting the option ZoomFit. (Make sure that your
quadratic equation is entered in the Y= screen before
doing this!)

Find a logistic regression curve of the form
P(t) =

1 + Ab−t
Solution with Technology Excel does not have a built-in logistic regression calculation, so we use an alternative method
that works for any type of regression curve.
1. First use rough estimates for N, A, and b, and compute the sum-of-squares error (SSE; see Section 1.5) directly:

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
Cells E2:G2 contain our initial rough estimates of N, A, and b. For N, we used 70 (notice that the y-coordinates do ap-
pear to level off around 70). For A, we used the fact that the y-intercept is N/(1 + A). In other words,
24 =
70
1 + A
Because a very rough estimate is all we are after, using A = 2 will do just ﬁne. For b, we chose 1.15 as the values of P
appear to be increasing by around 15% per year initially (again this is rough—we could equally have use 1.1 or 1.2).
2. Cell C2 contains the formula for P(t), and the square of the resulting residual is computed in D2.
3. Cell F6 will contain SSE. The completed spreadsheet should look like this:
Technology Guide
683
The best-ﬁt curve will result from values of N, A, and b that give a minimum value for SSE. We shall use Excel’s
“Solver,” found in the “Tools” menu, to ﬁnd these values for us. (If “Solver” does not appear in the Tools menu, select
Add-Ins in the Tools menu and install it.) Figure 22 shows the dialogue box with the necessary ﬁelds completed to solve
the problem.

TE C H N O LO GY G U I D E
• The Target Cell refers to the cell that contains SSE
• “Min” is selected because we are minimizing SSE.
• “Changing Cells” are obtained by selecting the cells that contain the current values of N, A, and b.
4. When you have ﬁlled in the values for the three items above, press “Solve” and tell Solver to Keep Solver Solution
when done. You will ﬁnd N ≈84.573, A ≈2.6428, and b ≈1.2845 so that
P(t) ≈

CA S E  STU DY Reducing Sulfur Emissions
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to formulate a policy that will encourage
utilities to reduce sulfur emissions. Its goal is to reduce annual emissions of sulfur dioxide by a
total of 10 million tons from the current level of 25 million tons by imposing a ﬁxed charge for
every ton of sulfur released into the environment per year. The EPA has some data showing
the marginal cost to utilities of reducing sulfur emissions. As a consultant to the EPA, you
must determine the amount to be charged per ton of sulfur emissions in light of these data.

Introduction
In the world around us, everything is changing. The mathematics of change is largely
about the rate of change: how fast and in which direction the change is occurring. Is the
Dow Jones average going up, and if so, how fast? If I raise my prices, how many cus-
tomers will I lose? If I launch this missile, how fast will it be traveling after two seconds,
how high will it go, and where will it come down?
We have already discussed the concept of rate of change for linear functions (straight
lines), where the slope measures the rate of change. But this works only because a straight
line maintains a constant rate of change along its whole length. Other functions rise faster
here than there—or rise in one place and fall in another—so that the rate of change varies
along the graph. The ﬁrst achievement of calculus is to provide a systematic and straight-
forward way of calculating (hence the name) these rates of change. To describe a chang-
ing world, we need a language of change, and that is what calculus is.
The history of calculus is an interesting story of personalities, intellectual move-
ments, and controversy. Credit for its invention is given to two mathematicians: Isaac
Newton (1642–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Newton, an English mathe-
matician and scientist, developed calculus ﬁrst, probably in the 1660s. We say “proba-
bly” because, for various reasons, he did not publish his ideas until much later. This al-
lowed Leibniz, a German mathematician and philosopher, to publish his own version of
calculus ﬁrst, in 1684. Fifteen years later, stirred up by nationalist fervor in England and
on the continent, controversy erupted over who should get the credit for the invention of
calculus. The debate got so heated that the Royal Society (of which Newton and Leibniz
were both members) set up a commission to investigate the question. The commission
decided in favor of Newton, who happened to be president of the society at the time. The
consensus today is that both mathematicians deserve credit because they came to the
same conclusions working independently. This is not really surprising: Both built on
well-known work of other people, and it was almost inevitable that someone would put
it all together at about that time.
Limits: Numerical and Graphical
Approaches (OPTIONAL)
Rates of change are calculated by derivatives, but an important part of the deﬁnition of
the derivative is something called a limit. Arguably, much of mathematics since the 18th
century has revolved around understanding, reﬁning, and exploiting the idea of the
limit. The basic idea is easy, but getting the technicalities right is not.
Evaluating Limits Numerically
Start with a very simple example: Look at the function f (x) = 2 + x and ask: What
happens to f (x) as x approaches 3? The following table shows the value of f (x) for
values of x close to and on either side of 3:

We have left the entry under 3 blank to emphasize that when calculating the limit of
f (x) as x approaches 3, we are not interested in its value when x equals 3.
Notice from the table that the closer x gets to 3 from either side, the closer f (x) gets
to 5. We write this as
lim
x→3 f (x) = 5
The limit of f (x), as x approaches 3, equals 5.
Q: Why all the fuss? Can’t we simply substitute x = 3 and avoid having to use a table?
A: This happens to work for some functions, but not for all functions. The following example
illustrates this point. ■
Example 1 Estimating a Limit Numerically
Use a table to estimate the following limits:
a. lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2
b. lim
x→0
e2x −1
x
Solution
a. We cannot simply substitute x = 2, because the function f (x) = x3 −8
x −2
is not 
deﬁned at x = 2. (Why?)* Instead, we use a table of values as we did above, with x
approaching 2 from both sides.

x approaching 0 from the left →
←x approaching 0 from the right
We notice that as x approaches 2 from either side, f (x) appears to be approaching 12.
This suggests that the limit is 12, and we write
lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2 = 12
b. The function g(x) = e2x −1
x
is not deﬁned at x = 0 (nor can it even be simpliﬁed to 
one which is deﬁned at x = 0). In the following table, we allow x to approach 0 from
both sides:
*However, if you factor x3 −8, you will ﬁnd that f (x) can be simpliﬁed to a function which is deﬁned at
x = 2. This point will be discussed (and this example redone) in Section 10.3. The function in part (b) cannot
be simpliﬁed by factoring.
The table suggests that lim
x→0
e2x −1
x
= 2.
using Technology
We can automate these
computations using a graphing
calculator or Excel. See the
Technology Guides at the end of
the chapter to ﬁnd out how to
create tables like these using a
TI-83/84 or Excel.

Before we go on... Although the table suggests that the limit in Example 1 part (b) is
2, it by no means establishes that fact conclusively. It is conceivable (though not in fact
the case here) that putting x = 0.000000087 could result in g(x) = 426. Using a table
can only suggest a value for the limit. In the next two sections we shall discuss algebraic
techniques for ﬁnding limits. ■
Before we continue, let us make a more formal deﬁnition.

Definition of a Limit
If f (x) approaches the number L as x approaches (but is not equal to) a from both sides,
then we say that f (x) approaches L as x →a (“x approaches a”) or that the limit of
f (x) as x →a is L. We write
lim
x→a f (x) = L
or
f (x) →L as x →a
If f (x) fails to approach a single ﬁxed number as x approaches a from both sides, then
we say that f (x) has no limit as x →a, or
lim
x→a f (x) does not exist.
1. lim
x→3(2 + x) = 5
See discussion before Example 1.
2. lim
x→−2(3x) = −6
As x approaches −2, 3x approaches −6.
3. lim
x→0(x2 −2x + 1) exists.
In fact, the limit is 1.
4. lim
x→5
1
x = 1
5
As x approaches 5, 1
x approaches 1
5 .
5. lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2 = 12
See Example 1. (We cannot just put x = 2 here.)
(For examples where the limit does not exist, see Example 2.)
Notes
1. It is important that f (x) approach the same number as x approaches a from either side.
For instance, if f (x) approaches 5 for x = 1.9, 1.99, 1.999, . . . , but approaches 4 for
x = 2.1, 2.01, 2.001, . . . , then the limit as x →2 does not exist. (See Example 2
for such a situation.)
2. It may happen that f (x) does not approach any ﬁxed number at all as x →a from
either side. In this case, we also say that the limit does not exist.
3. We are being deliberately vague as to exactly what we mean by the word
“approaches”; instead, we trust your intuition. However, the following phrasing of the
deﬁnition of the limit is close to the more technical one used by mathematicians. ■
Verbal Form of the Mathematical Definition of a Limit
We can make f (x) be as close to L as we like by choosing any x sufﬁciently close
to (but not equal to) a.

The following example gives instances in which a stated limit does not exist.

The table shows that as x gets closer to zero on either side, f (x) gets larger and larger
without bound—that is, if you name any number, no matter how large, f (x) will be
even larger than that if x is sufﬁciently close to 0. Because f (x) is not approaching 
any real number, we conclude that lim
x→0
1
x2 does not exist. Because f (x) is becoming 
arbitrarily large, we also say that lim
x→0
1
x2 diverges to +∞, or just
lim
x→0
1
x2 = +∞
Note This is not meant to imply that the limit exists; the symbol +∞does not repre-
sent any real number. We write limx→a f (x) = +∞to indicate two things: (1) the
limit does not exist and (2) the function gets large without bound as x approaches a. ■
b. Here is a table of values for f (x) = |x|
x , with x approaching 0 from both sides.
The table shows that f (x) does not approach the same limit as x approaches 0 from
both sides. There appear to be two different limits: the limit as we approach 0 from the
left and the limit as we approach from the right. We write
lim
x→0−f (x) = −1
read as “the limit as x approaches 0 from the left (or from below) is −1” and
lim
x→0+ f (x) = 1
read as “the limit as x approaches 0 from the right (or from above) is 1.” These are
called the one-sided limits of f (x). In order for f to have a two-sided limit, the two
one-sided limits must be equal. Because they are not, we conclude that limx→0 f (x)
does not exist.

c. Near x = 2, we have the following table of values for f (x) =

Because 
1
x −2 is approaching no (single) real number as x →2, we see that 
lim

x −2 does not exist. Notice also that  1
x −2 diverges to +∞as x →2 from the 
positive side (right half of the table) and to −∞as x →2 from the left (left half of
the table). In other words,
lim
x→2−

x −2 = −∞

In another useful kind of limit, we let x approach either +∞or −∞, by which we
mean that we let x get arbitrarily large or let x become an arbitrarily large negative num-
ber. The next example illustrates this.
Example 3 Limits at Infinity
Use a table to estimate: a. lim
x→+∞
2x2 −4x
x2 −1
and b. lim
x→−∞
2x2 −4x
x2 −1 .
Solution
a. By saying that x is “approaching +∞,” we mean that x is getting larger and larger
without bound, so we make the following table:
(Note that we are only approaching +∞from the left because we can hardly approach it
fromtheright!)Whatseemstobehappeningisthat f (x)isapproaching2.Thuswewrite
lim
x→+∞f (x) = 2
b. Here, x is approaching −∞, so we make a similar table, this time with x assuming
negative values of greater and greater magnitude (read this table from right to left):

Once again, f (x) is approaching 2. Thus, limx→−∞f (x) = 2.

Estimating Limits Graphically
We can often estimate a limit from a graph, as the next example shows.
Example 4 Estimating Limits Graphically
The graph of a function f is shown in Figure 1. (Recall that the solid dots indicate points
on the graph, and the hollow dots indicate points not on the graph.)

From the graph, analyze the following limits.
a. lim
x→−2 f (x)
b. lim
x→0 f (x)
c. lim
x→1 f (x)
d. lim
x→+∞f (x)
Solution Since we are given only a graph of f, we must analyze these limits graphically.
a. Imagine that Figure 1 was drawn on a graphing calculator equipped with a trace fea-
ture that allows us to move a cursor along the graph and see the coordinates as we go.
To simulate this, place a pencil point on the graph to the left of x = −2, and move it
along the curve so that the x-coordinate approaches −2. (See Figure 2.) We evaluate
the limit numerically by noting the behavior of the y-coordinates.*
However, we can see directly from the graph that the y-coordinate approaches 2. Sim-
ilarly, if we place our pencil point to the right of x = −2 and move it to the left, the
y-coordinate will approach 2 from that side as well (Figure 3). Therefore, as x ap-
proaches −2 from either side, f (x) approaches 2, so
lim
x→−2 f (x) = 2
b. This time we move our pencil point toward x = 0. Referring to Figure 4, if we
start from the left of x = 0 and approach 0 (by moving right), the y-coordinate
*For a visual animation of this process, look at the online tutorial for this section.

approaches −1. However, if we start from the right of x = 0 and approach 0 (by mov-
ing left), the y-coordinate approaches 3. Thus (see Example 2),
lim
x→0−f (x) = −1
and
lim
x→0+ f (x) = 3
Because these limits are not equal, we conclude that
lim
x→0 f (x) does not exist
In this case there is a “break” in the graph at x = 0, and we say that the function is
discontinuous at x = 0 (see Section 10.7).
692

c. Once more we think about a pencil point moving along the graph with the x-coordinate
this time approaching x = 1 from the left and from the right (Figure 5). As the 
x-coordinate of the point approaches 1 from either side, the y-coordinate approaches
1 also. Therefore,
lim
x→1 f (x) = 1
d. For this limit, x is supposed to approach inﬁnity. We think about a pencil point mov-
ing along the graph further and further to the right as shown in Figure 6.
As the x-coordinate gets larger, the y-coordinate also gets larger and larger without
bound. Thus, f (x) diverges to +∞:
lim
x→+∞f (x) = +∞
Similarly,
lim
x→−∞f (x) = +∞
Before we go on... In Example 4(c) limx→1 f (x) = 1 but f (1) = 2 (why?).
Thus, limx→1 f (x) ̸= f (1). In other words, the limit of f (x) as x approaches 1 is not
the same as the value of f at x = 1. Always keep in mind that when we evaluate a limit
as x →a, we do not care about the value of the function at x = a. We only care about
the value of f (x) as x approaches a. In other words, f (a) may or may not equal
limx→a f (x). ■

10.1 Limits: Numerical and Graphical Approaches (OPTIONAL)
693
Evaluating Limits Graphically
To decide whether limx→a f (x) exists and to ﬁnd its value if it does:
1. Draw the graph of f (x) by hand or with graphing technology.
2 Position your pencil point (or the Trace cursor) on a point of the graph to the right
of x = a.
3. Move the point along the graph toward x = a from the right and read the y-coordinate
as you go. The value the y-coordinate approaches (if any) is the limit limx→a+ f (x).
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3, this time starting from a point on the graph to the left of x = a,
and approaching x = a along the graph from the left. The value the y-coordinate
approaches (if any) is limx→a−f (x).
5. If the left and right limits both exist and have the same value L, then limx→a f (x) = L.
Otherwise, the limit does not exist. The value f (a) has no relevance whatsoever.
6. To evaluate limx→+∞f (x), move the pencil point toward the far right of the graph
and estimate the value the y-coordinate approaches (if any). For limx→−∞f (x), move
the pencil point toward the far left.
7. If x = a happens to be an endpoint of the domain of f, then only a one-sided limit is
possible at x = a. For instance, if the domain is (−∞, 4], then limx→4−f (x) can be
computed, but not limx→4 f (x) or limx→4+ f (x).
Here is a summary of the graphical method we used in Example 4, together with
some additional information:
In the next example we use both the numerical and graphical approaches.

What seems to be happening as x approaches 0 from the right is that f (x) is in-
creasing without bound, as in Example 4(d). That is, if you name any number, no matter
how large, f (x) will be even larger than that if x is sufﬁciently close to zero. Thus, the
limit diverges to +∞, so
lim
x→0+
1
x = +∞
Graphical Method Recall that the graph of f (x) = 1
x is the standard hyperbola shown
in Figure 7.
The ﬁgure also shows the pencil point moving so that its x-coordinate approaches 0
from the right. Because the point moves along the graph, it is forced to go higher and

higher. In other words, its y-coordinate becomes larger and larger, approaching +∞.
Thus, we conclude that
lim
x→0+
1
x = +∞
Before we go on... In Example 5(a) you should also check that
lim

x = −∞
We say that as x approaches 0 from the left, 1

Application
Example 6 Internet Connectivity
The number of U.S. households connected to the Internet can be modeled by*
N(t) =
80
1 + 2.2(3.68)−t
(t ≥0)
where t is time in years since 1999.
a. Estimate limt→+∞N(t) and interpret the answer.
b. Estimate limt→0+ N(t) and interpret the answer.
Solution
a. Figure 8 shows a plot of N(t) for 0 < t < 10:
Using either the numerical or graphical approach, we ﬁnd
lim
t→+∞N(t) = lim
t→+∞
80
1 + 2.2(3.68)−t = 80
Thus, in the long term (as t gets larger and larger) the percentage of U.S. households
connected to the Internet is expected to approach 80%.
b. The limit here is
lim
t→0+ N(t) = lim
t→0+
80
1 + 2.2(3.68)−t = 25
(Notice that in this case, we can simply put t = 0 to evaluate this limit.) Thus, the
closer t gets to 0 (representing 1999) the closer N(t) gets to 25%, meaning that, in
1999, 25% of U.S. households were connected to the Internet.

FAQs
Determining When a Limit Does or Does Not Exist
Q: If I substitute x = a in the formula for a function and find that the function is not defined
there, it means that limx→a f(x) does not exist, right?
A: Wrong. The limit may still exist, as in Example 1, or may not exist, as in Example 2. In
general, whether or not limx→a f(x) exists has nothing to do with f(a), but rather the value of
f when x is very close to, but not equal to a. ■
Q: Is there a quick and easy way of telling from a graph whether limx→a f(x) exists?
A: Yes. If you cover up the portion of the graph corresponding to x = a, and it appears as
though the visible part of the graph could be made into a continuous line by filling in a suitable
point at x = a, then the limit exists. (The “suitable point” need not be (a, f(a).) Otherwise, it
does not. Try this method with the curves in Example 4. ■

Continuous Function
Let f be a function and let a be a number in the domain of f. Then f is continuous at a if
a. limx→a f (x) exists, and
b. limx→a f (x) = f (a).
The function f is said to be continuous on its domain if it is continuous at each point in
its domain.
If f is not continuous at a particular a in its domain, we say that f is discontinuous
at a or that f has a discontinuity at a. Thus, a discontinuity can occur at x = a if either
a. limx→a f (x) does not exist, or
b. limx→a f (x) exists but is not equal to f (a).
1. The function shown in Figure 9 is continuous at x = −1 and x = 2. It is discontinu-
ous at x = 0 and x = 1, and so is not continuous on its domain.
2. The function f (x) = x2 is continuous on its domain. (Think of its graph, which con-
tains no breaks.)
3. The function f whose graph is shown on the left in the following ﬁgure is contin-
uous on its domain. (Although the graph breaks at x = 2, that is not a point of its
domain.) The function g whose graph is shown on the right is not continuous on its
quick Examples
10.2 Limits and Continuity (OPTIONAL)
In Section 10.1 we saw examples of graphs that had various kinds of “breaks” or
“jumps.” For instance, in Example 4 we looked at the graph in Figure 9.
This graph appears to have breaks, or discontinuities, at x = 0 and at x = 1. At
x = 0 we saw that limx→0 f (x) does not exist because the left- and right-hand limits are
not the same. Thus, the discontinuity at x = 0 seems to be due to the fact that the limit
does not exist there. On the other hand, at x = 1, limx→1 f (x) does exist (it is equal
to 1), but is not equal to f (1) = 2.
Thus, we have identiﬁed two kinds of discontinuity:
(1) Points where the limit of the function does not exist.
x = 0 in Figure 9 because
limx→0 f (x) does not exist.
(2) Points where the limit exists but does not equal
x = 1 in Figure 9 because
the value of the function.
limx→1 f (x) = 1 ̸= f (1)
On the other hand, there is no discontinuity at, say, x = −2, where we ﬁnd that
limx→−2 f (x) exists and equals 2 and f (−2) is also equal to 2. In other words,
lim
x→−2 f (x) = 2 = f (−2)
The point x = −2 is an example of a point where f is continuous. (Notice that you can
draw the portion of the graph near x = −2 without lifting your pencil from the paper.)
Similarly, f is continuous at every point other than x = 0 and x = 1. Here is the mathe-
matical deﬁnition.

Note If the number a is not in the domain of f—that is, if f (a) is not deﬁned—we will
not consider the question of continuity at a. A function cannot be continuous at a point
not in its domain, and it cannot be discontinuous there either. ■

Which of the following functions are continuous on their domains?
a. h(x) =

Solution
a. and b. The graphs of h and k are shown in Figure 10.
y = h(x)
y = k(x)
Figure 10
Even though the graph of h is made up of two different line segments, it is continuous at
every point of its domain, including x = 1 because

of g.)

y = g(x): Not continuous

On the other hand, x = 1 is also in the domain of k, but limx→1 k(x) does not exist.
Thus, k is discontinuous at x = 1 and thus not continuous on its domain.
c. and d. The graphs of f and g are shown in Figure 11.
y = f (x)
y = g(x)
Figure 11
The domain of f consists of all real numbers except 0 and f is continuous at all such
numbers. (Notice that 0 is not in the domain of f, so the question of continuity at 0 does
not arise.) Thus, f is continuous on its domain.
The function g, on the other hand, has its domain expanded to include 0, so we now
need to check whether g is continuous at 0. From the graph, it is easy to see that g is dis-
continuous there because limx→0 g(x) does not exist. Thus, g is not continuous on its
domain because it is discontinuous at 0.

+Before we go on...
Q: Wait a minute! How can a function like f(x) = 1/x be continuous when its graph has a break
in it?
A: We are not claiming that f is continuous at every real number. What we are saying is that f is
continuous on its domain; the break in the graph occurs at a point not in the domain of f. In other
words, f is continuous on the set of all nonzero real numbers; it is not continuous on the set of
all real numbers because it is not even defined on the set. ■
Example 2 Continuous Except at a Point
In each case, say what, if any, value of f (a) would make f continuous at a.
a. f (x) = x3 −8
x −2 ; a = 2
b. f (x) = e2x −1
x
; a = 0
c. f (x) = |x|
x ; a = 0
Solution
a. In Figure 12 we see the graph of f (x) = x3 −8
x −2 . The point corresponding to x = 2
is missing because f is not (yet) deﬁned there. (Your graphing utility will probably
miss this subtlety and render a continuous curve.)

To turn f into a function that is continuous at x = 2, we need to “ﬁll in the gap” so
as to obtain a continuous curve. Since the graph suggests that the missing point is 
(2, 12), let us deﬁne f (2) = 12.
Does f now become continuous if we take f (2) = 12? From the graph, or Exam-
ple 1(a) of Section 10.1,
lim
x→2 f (x) = lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2 = 12
which is now equal to f (2). Thus, limx→2 f (x) = f (2), showing that f is now con-
tinuous at x = 2.
b. In Example 1(b) of the preceding section, we saw that
lim
x→0 f (x) = lim
x→0
e2x −1
x
= 2
and so, as in part (a), we must deﬁne f (0) = 2. This is conﬁrmed by the graph
shown in Figure 13.
c. We considered the function f (x) = |x|/x in Example 2 in Section 10.1. Its graph is
shown in Figure 14.
Figure 14
Figure 15
Now we encounter a problem: No matter how we try to ﬁll in the gap at x = 0, the
result will be a discontinuous function. For example, setting f (0) = 0 will result in
the discontinuous function shown in Figure 15.
We conclude that it is impossible to assign any value to f (0) to turn f into a func-
tion that is continuous at x = 0.
We can also see this result algebraically: In Example 2 of Section 10.1, we saw that
lim
x→0
|x|
x
does not exist. Thus, the resulting function will fail to be continuous at 0, 
no matter how we deﬁne f (0).
A function not deﬁned at an isolated point is said to have a singularity at that point.
The function in part (a) of Example 2 has a singularity at x = 2, and the functions in
parts (b) and (c) have singularities at x = 0. The functions in parts (a) and (b) have
removable singularities because we can make these functions continuous at x = a by
properly deﬁning f (a). The function in part (c) has an essential singularity because we
cannot make f continuous at x = a just by deﬁning f (a) properly.

Limits and Continuity: 
Algebraic Approach (OPTIONAL)
Although numerical and graphical estimation of limits is effective, the estimates these
methods yield may not be perfectly accurate. The algebraic method, when it can be used,
will always yield an exact answer. Moreover, algebraic analysis of a function often
enables us to take a function apart and see “what makes it tick.”
Let’s start with the function f (x) = 2 + x and ask: What happens to f (x) as x ap-
proaches 3? To answer this algebraically, notice that as x gets closer and closer to 3, the
quantity 2 + x must get closer and closer to 2 + 3 = 5. Hence,
lim
x→3 f (x) = lim
x→3(2 + x) = 2 + 3 = 5

Q: Is that all there is to the algebraic method? Just substitute x = a?
A: Under certain circumstances: Notice that by substituting x = 3 we evaluated the function at
x = 3. In other words, we relied on the fact that
lim
x→3 f (x) = f (3)
In Section 10.2 we said that a function satisfying this equation is continuous at x = 3. ■
Thus,
Ifweknowthatthefunction f iscontinuousatapointa,wecancomputelimx→a f (x)
by simply substituting x = a into f (x).
To use this fact, we need to know how to recognize continuous functions when we
see them. Geometrically, they are easy to spot: A function is continuous at x = a if its
graph has no break at x = a. Algebraically, a large class of functions are known to be
continuous on their domains—those, roughly speaking, that are speciﬁed by a single
formula.
We can be more precise: A closed-form function is any function that can be ob-
tained by combining constants, powers of x, exponential functions, radicals, logarithms,
and trigonometric functions (and some other functions we do not encounter in this text)
into a single mathematical formula by means of the usual arithmetic operations and
composition of functions. (They can be as complicated as we like.)

Closed-Form Functions
A closed-form function is any function that can be obtained by combining constants,
powers of x, exponential functions, radicals, logarithms, and trigonometric functions
(and some other functions we do not encounter in this text) into a single mathematical
formula by means of the usual arithmetic operations and composition of functions.

2. f (x) =

if x ≤−1
x2 + x
if −1 < x ≤1
2 −x
if 1 < x ≤2
is not a closed-form function because f (x) is not
speciﬁed by a single mathematical formula.
What is so special about closed-form functions is the following theorem:
quick Example
Theorem: Continuity of Closed-Form Functions
Every closed-form function is continuous on its domain. Thus, if f is a closed-form
function and f (a) is deﬁned, we have limx→a f (x) = f (a).
f (x) = 1/x is a closed-form function, and its natural domain consists of all real num-
bers except 0. Thus, f is continuous at every nonzero real number. That is, 
lim
x→a
1
x = 1
a
provided a ̸= 0.

Mathematics majors spend a great deal of time studying the proof of this theorem.
We ask you to accept it without proof.
Example 1 Limit of a Closed-Form Function
Evaluate lim
x→1
x3 −8
x −2 algebraically.
Solution
First, notice that (x3 −8)/(x −2) is a closed-form function because it is speciﬁed by a
single algebraic formula. Also, x = 1 is in the domain of this function. Therefore,
lim
x→1
x3 −8
x −2 = 13 −8
1 −2 = 7
Before we go on... In Example 1, the point x = 2 is not in the domain of the function 
(x3 −8)/(x −2), so we cannot evaluate lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2 by substituting x = 2. However—
and this is the key to ﬁnding such limits—some preliminary algebraic simpliﬁcation
will allow us to obtain a closed-form function with x = 2 in its domain, as we shall see
in Example 2. ■
Example 2 Simplifying to Obtain the Limit
Evaluate lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2 algebraically.
Solution
Again, although (x3 −8)/(x −2) is a closed-form function, x = 2 is not in its domain.
Thus, we cannot obtain the limit by substitution. Instead, we ﬁrst simplify f (x) to ob-
tain a new function with x = 2 in its domain. To do this, notice ﬁrst that the numerator
can be factored as
x3 −8 = (x −2)(x2 + 2x + 4)
Thus,
x3 −8
x −2 = (x −2)(x2 + 2x + 4)
x −2
= x2 + 2x + 4
Once we have canceled the offending (x −2) in the denominator, we are left with a
closed-form function with 2 in its domain. Thus,
lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2 = lim
x→2(x2 + 2x + 4)
= 22 + 2(2) + 4 = 12
Substitute x = 2.
This conﬁrms the answer we found numerically in Example 1 in Section 10.1.
If the given function fails to simplify, we can always approximate the limit numeri-
cally. It may very well be that the limit does not exist in such a case.

Q: There is something suspicious about Example 2. If 2 was not in the domain before simplifying
but was in the domain after simplifying, we must have changed the function, right?
A: Correct. In fact, when we said that
x3 −8
x −2 = x2 + 2x + 4
Domain excludes 2
Domain includes 2
we were lying a little bit. What we really meant is that these two expressions are equal
where both are defined. The functions (x3 −8)/(x −2) and x2 + 2x + 4 are different functions.
The difference is that x = 2 is not in the domain of (x3 −8)/(x −2) and is in the domain of
x2 + 2x + 4. Since limx→2 f(x) explicitly ignores any value that f may have at 2, this does not
affect the limit. From the point of view of the limit at 2, these functions are equal. In general
we have the following rule. ■
706
Chapter 10
Introduction to the Derivative
quick Example
Functions with Equal Limits
If f (x) = g(x) for all x except possibly x = a, then
lim
x→a f (x) = lim
x→a g(x).
x2 −1
x −1 = x + 1 for all x except x = 1.
Write x2 −1
x −1 as (x + 1)(x −1)
x −1
and cancel the (x −1).
Therefore, 
lim
x→1
x2 −1
x −1 = lim
x→1 (x + 1) = 1 + 1 = 2
We can also use algebraic techniques to analyze functions that are not given in
closed form.
Example 3 Nonclosed-Form Function
For which values of x are the following piecewise deﬁned functions continuous?
a. f (x) =

x2 + 2
if x < 1
2x −1
if x ≥1
b. g(x) =
 x2 −x + 1
if x ≤0
1 −x
if 0 < x ≤1
x −3
if x > 1
Solution
a. The function f (x) is given in closed form over the intervals (−∞, 1) and [1, +∞).
At x = 1, f (x) suddenly switches from one closed-form formula to another, so x = 1
is the only place where there is a potential problem with continuity. To investigate the
continuity of f (x) at x = 1, let’s calculate the limit there:
lim
x→1−f (x) = lim
x→1−(x2 + 2)
f (x) = x2 + 2 for x < 1.
= (1)2 + 2 = 3
x2 + 2 is closed-form.
lim
x→1+ f (x) = lim
x→1+(2x −1)
f (x) = 2x −1 for x > 1.
= 2(1) −1 = 1
2x −1 is closed-form.

Because the left and right limits are different, limx→1 f (x) does not exist, and so
f (x) is discontinuous at x = 1.
b. The only potential points of discontinuity for g(x) occur at x = 0 and x = 1:
lim
x→0−g(x) = lim
x→0−x2 −x + 1 = 1
lim
x→0+ g(x) = lim
x→0+ 1 −x = 1
Thus, limx→0 g(x) = 1. Further, g(0) = 02 −0 + 1 = 1 from the formula, and so 
lim
x→0 g(x) = g(0)
which shows that g(x) is continuous at x = 0. At x = 1 we have
lim
x→1−g(x) = lim
x→1−1 −x = 0
lim
x→1+ g(x) = lim
x→1+ x −3 = −2
so that limx→1 g(x) does not exist. Thus, g(x) is discontinuous at x = 1. We conclude
that g(x) is continuous at every real number x except x = 1.
Before we go on... Figure 16 shows the graph of g from Example 3(b). Notice how the
discontinuity at x = 1 shows up as a break in the graph, whereas at x = 0 the two pieces
“ﬁt together” at the point (0, 1). ■
Limits at Infinity
Let’s look once again at Example 3 in Section 10.1 and some similar limits.
Example 4 Limits at Infinity
Compute the following limits, if they exist:
a. lim
x→+∞
2x2 −4x
x2 −1
b. lim
x→−∞
2x2 −4x
x2 −1
c. lim
x→+∞
−x3 −4x
2x2 −1
d. lim
x→+∞
2x2 −4x
5x3 −3x + 5
Solution
a. and b. While calculating the values for the tables used in Example 3 in Section 10.1,
you might have noticed that the highest power of x in both the numerator and denomi-
nator dominated the calculations. For instance, when x = 100,000, the term 2x2 in the
numerator has the value of 20,000,000,000, whereas the term 4x has the comparatively
insigniﬁcant value of 400,000. Similarly, the term x2 in the denominator overwhelms the
term −1. In other words, for large values of x (or negative values with large magnitude),
2x2 −4x

Therefore,

Let’s look again at the limits (a) and (b) in Example 4. We say that the graph of f
has a horizontal asymptote at y = 2 because of the limits we have just calculated. This
means that the graph approaches the horizontal line y = 2 far to the right or left (in this
case, to both the right and left). Figure 17 shows the graph of f together with the line y = 2.
The graph reveals some additional interesting information: as x →1+, f (x) →
−∞, and as x →1−, f (x) →+∞. Thus,
lim
x→1 f (x) does not exist
See if you can determine what happens as x →−1.
If you graph the function in part (d) of Example 4, you will again see a horizontal
asymptote at y = 0.  Does the limit in part (c) show a horizontal asymptote? 
In Example 4, f (x) was a rational function: a quotient of polynomial functions.
We calculated the limit of f (x) at ±∞by ignoring all powers of x in both the numer-
ator and denominator except for the largest. Following is a theorem that justiﬁes this
procedure:

with the ci and di constants (cn ̸= 0 and dm ̸= 0),then we can calculate the limit of f (x)

Proof Our function f (x) is a polynomial of degree n divided by a polynomial of degree
m. If n happens to be larger than m, then dividing the top and bottom by the largest
power xn of x gives
f (x) = cnxn + cn−1xn−1 + · · · + c1x + c0
dmxm + dm−1xm−1 · · · + d1x + d0
=
cnxn/xn + cn−1xn−1/xn + · · · + c1x/xn + c0/xn
dmxm/xn + dm−1xm−1/xn + · · · + d1x/xn + d0/xn
Canceling powers of x in each term and remembering that n > m leaves us with
f (x) =
cn + cn−1/x + · · · + c1/xn−1 + c0/xn
dm/xn−m + dm−1/xn−m+1 + · · · + d1/xn−1 + d0/xn
As x →±∞, all the terms shown in red approach 0, so we can ignore them in taking
the limit. (The ﬁrst term in the denominator happens to approach zero as well, but we
retain it for convenience.) Thus,
lim
x→±∞f (x) =
lim
x→±∞
cn
dm/xn−m =
lim

as required. The cases when n is smaller than m and m = n are proved similarly by
dividing top and bottom by the largest power of x in each case.

Strategy for Evaluating Limits Algebraically
Q: Is there a systematic way to evaluate a limit limx→a f(x) algebraically?
A: The following approach is often successful:
Case 1: a Is a Finite Number (Not ±∞)
1. Decide whether f is a closed-form function. If it is not, then find the left and right limits at
the values of x where the function changes from one formula to another.
2. If f is a closed-form function, try substituting x = a in the formula for f(x). Then one of
three things will happen:
f(a) is defined. Then limx→a f(x) = f(a).
f(a) is not defined and has the form 0/0. Try to simplify the expression for f to cancel one
of the terms that gives 0. 
f(a) is not defined and has the form k/0 where k is not zero. Then the function diverges
to ±∞as x approaches a from each side. Check this graphically, as in Example 4 
(see “Before we go on”).
Case 2: a = ±∞
If the given function is a polynomial or ratio of polynomials, use the technique of Example 4:
Focus only on the highest powers of x. ■

Average Rate of Change
Calculus is the mathematics of change, inspired largely by observation of continuously
changing quantities around us in the real world. As an example, the New York metro area
consumer conﬁdence index C decreased from 100 points in January 2000 to 80 points in
January 2002.19 As we saw in Chapter 1, the change in this index can be measured as
the difference:
C = Second value −First value = 80 −100 = −20 points
(The fact that the conﬁdence index decreased is reﬂected in the negative sign of the
change.) The kind of question we will concentrate on is how fast the conﬁdence index
was dropping. Because C decreased by 20 points in 2 years, we say it averaged a 20/2 = 10
point drop each year. (It actually dropped less than 10 points the ﬁrst year and more the
second, giving an average drop of 10 points each year.)
Alternatively, we might want to measure this rate in points per month rather than
points per year. Because C decreased by 20 points in 24 months, it went down at an av-
erage rate of 20/24 ≈0.833 points per month.
19 Figures are approximate. SOURCE: Siena College Research Institute/New York Times, February 10, 2002,

mated). SOURCE: J.D. Power Associates/New York Times, January 25,

In both cases, we obtained the average rate of change by dividing the change by the
corresponding length of time:
Average rate of change =
Change in C
Change in time = −20

= −10 points per year
Average rate of change =

The following table lists the approximate value of Standard and Poors 500 stock market
index (S&P) during the 10-year period 1998–2004* (t = 8 represents 1998):

a. What was the average rate of change in the S&P over the two-year period 1998–2000
(the period 8 ≤t ≤10 or [8, 10] in interval notation); over the four-year period
2000–2004 (the period 10 ≤t ≤14 or [10, 14]; and over the period [8, 11]?
b. Graph the values shown in the table. How are the rates of change reﬂected in the
graph?
Solution
a. During the two-year period [8, 10], the S&P changed as follows:
Start of the period (t = 8):  
S(8) = 1200
End of the period (t = 10): 
S(10) = 1450
Change during the period [8, 10]:
S(10) −S(8) = 250
Thus, the S&P increased by 250 points in 2 years, giving an average rate of change of
250/2 = 125 points per year. We can write the calculation this way:
Average rate of change of S = Change in S
Change in t
= S
t
= S(10) −S(8)
10 −8
= 1450 −1200
10 −8
= 250
2
= 125 points per year
LWA-Dann Tardif/Corbis

Interpreting the result: During the period [8, 10] (that is, 1998–2000), the S&P in-
creased at an average rate of 125 points per year.
Similarly, the average rate of change during the period [10, 14] was
Average rate of change of S = S
t = S(14) −S(10)
14 −10
= 1100 −1450
14 −10
= −350
4
= −87.5 points per year
Interpreting the result: During the period [10, 14] the S&P decreased at an average
rate of 87.5 points per year.
Finally, during the period [8, 11], the average rate of change was
Average rate of change of S = S
t = S(11) −S(8)
11 −8
= 1200 −1200
11 −8
= 0
3 = 0 points per year
Interpreting the result: During the period [8, 11] the average rate of change of
the S&P was zero points per year (even though its value did ﬂuctuate during that
period).
b. In Chapter 1, we saw that the rate of change of a quantity that changes linearly with time
is measured by the slope of its graph. However, the S&P index does not change linearly
with time. Figure 18 shows the data plotted two different ways: (a) as a bar chart and
(b) as a piecewise linear graph. Bar charts are more commonly used in the media, but
Figure 18b on the right illustrates the changing index price more clearly.

We saw in part (a) that the average rate of change of S over the interval [8, 10] is
the ratio
Rate of change of S = S
t = Change in S
Change in t = S(10) −S(8)
10 −8
Notice that this rate of change is also the slope of the line through P and Q shown in
Figure 19.
Average Rate of Change as Slope: The average rate of change of the S&P over the
interval [8, 10] is the slope of the line passing through the points on the graph where
t = 8 and t = 10.

(b)

Similarly, the average rates of change of the S&P over the intervals [10, 14] and
[8, 11] are the slopes of the lines through pairs of corresponding points.
Here is the formal deﬁnition of the average rate of change of a function over an
interval.

Change and Average Rate of Change of f over [a, b]: Difference Quotient
The change in f (x) over the interval [a, b] is
Change in f = f
= Second value −First value
= f (b) −f (a)
The average rate of change of f(x) over the interval [a, b] is
Average rate of change of f = Change in f

We also call this average rate of change the difference quotient of f over the interval
[a, b]. (It is the quotient of the differences f (b) −f (a) and b −a.) A line through two
points of a graph like P and Q is called a secant line of the graph.

Average Rate of Change of a Function 
Using Graphical Data
In Example 1 we saw that the average rate of change of a quantity can be determined
directly from a graph. Here is an example that further illustrates the graphical
approach.
Example 2 Average Rate of Change from a Graph
Figure 20 shows the number of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) sold in the U.S. each year
from 1990 through 2003  (t = 0 represents the year 1990, and N(t) represents sales in
year t in thousands of vehicles).*

Chapter 10
Introduction to the Derivative
quick Example
Units
The units of the change in f are the units of f(x).
The units of the average rate of change of f are units of f (x) per unit of x.
If f (3) = −1 billion dollars, f (5) = 0.5 billion dollars, and x is measured in years, then
the change and  average rate of change of f over the interval [3, 5] are given by
Change in f = f (5) −f (3) = 0.5 −(−1) = 1.5 billion dollars
Average rate of change  f (5) −f (3)
5 −3
= 0.5 −(−1)
2
= 0.75 billion dollars/year
Alternative Formula: Average Rate of Change of f over [a, a + h]
(Replace b above by a + h.) The average rate of change of f over the interval [a, a + h] is
Average rate of change of f = f (a + h) −f (a)

interval [6, 11] and interpret the result.
b. Over which one-year period(s) was the average rate of change of N(t) the greatest?

a. The average rate of change of N over the interval  [6, 11] is given by the slope of
the line through the points P and Q shown in Figure 21.

From the ﬁgure,

= 1000

= 200
Thus, the rate of change of N over the interval [6, 11] is approximately 200.
Q: How do we interpret the result?
A: A clue is given by the units of the average rate of change: units of N per unit of t. The
units of N are thousands of SUVs and the units of t are years. Thus, the average rate of change
of N is measured in thousands of SUVs per year, and we can now interpret the result as 
follows:
Interpreting the average rate of change: Sales of SUVs were increasing at an
average rate of 200,000 SUVs per year from 1996 to 2001. ■
b. The rates of change of annual sales over successive one-year periods are given by
the slopes of the individual line segments that make up the graph in Figure 20. Thus,
the greatest average rate of change over a single year corresponds to the segment(s)
with the largest slope. If you look carefully at the ﬁgure, you will notice that the
segment corresponding to [11, 12] is the steepest. (The segment corresponding to
[6, 7] is slightly less steep.) Thus, the average rate of change of annual sales was
largest over the one-year period from 2001 to 2002.
Before we go on... Notice in Example 2 that we do not get exact answers from a graph;
the best we can do is estimate the rates of change: Was the exact answer to part (a) closer
to 201 or 202? Two people can reasonably disagree about results read from a graph, and
you should bear this in mind when you check the answers to the exercises.
Perhaps the most sophisticated way to compute the average rate of change of a
quantity is through the use of a mathematical formula or model for the quantity in
question. ■

Example 3 Average Rate of Change from a Formula 
You are a commodities trader and you monitor the price of gold on the New York Spot
Market very closely during an active morning. Suppose you ﬁnd that the price of an
ounce of gold can be approximated by the function 
G(t) = −2t2 + 36t + 228 dollars
(7.5 ≤t ≤10.5)
where t is time in hours. (See Figure 22. t = 8 represents 8:00 AM.)

Looking at the graph on the right, we can see that the price of gold rose rather
rapidly at the beginning of the time period, but by t = 8.5 the rise had slowed, until the
market faltered and the price began to fall more and more rapidly toward the end of the
period. What was the average rate of change of the price of gold over the 1 1
2-hour period
starting at 8:00 AM (the interval [8, 9.5] on the t-axis)?
Solution We have
Average rate of change of G over [8. 9.5] = G
t = G(9.5) −G(8)
9.5 −8
From the formula for G(t), we ﬁnd
G(9.5) = −2(9.5)2 + 36(9.5) + 228 = 389.5
G(8) = −2(8)2 + 36(8) + 228 = 388
Thus, the average rate of change of G is given by
G(9.5) −G(8)
9.5 −8
= 389.5 −388
1.5
= 1.5
1.5 = $1 per hour
In other words, the price of gold was increasing at an average rate of $1 per hour over
the given 1 1
2-hour period.

how we can use a TI-83/84 or

Example 4 Rates of Change over Shorter Intervals
Continuing with Example 3, use technology to compute the average rate of change of
G(t) = −2t2 + 36t + 228
(7.5 ≤t ≤10.5)
over the intervals [8, 8 + h], where h = 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001. What do the
answers tell you about the price of gold?
Solution
We use the alternative formula
Average rate of change of G over [a, a + h] = G(a + h) −G(a)
h
so
Average rate of change of G over [8, 8 + h] = G(8 + h) −G(8)
h
Let us calculate this average rate of change for some of the values of h listed:
h = 1:
G(8 + h) = G(8 + 1) = G(9) = −2(9)2 + 36(9) + 228 = 390
G(8) = −2(8)2 + 36(8) + 228 = 388
Average rate of change of G = G(9) −G(8)
1
= 390 −388
1
= 2
h = 0.1:
G(8 + h) = G(8 + 0.1) = G(8.1) = −2(8.1)2 + 36(8.1) + 228 = 388.38
G(8) = −2(8)2 + 36(8) + 228 = 388
Average rate of change of G = G(8.1) −G(8)
0.1
= 388.38 −388
0.1
= 3.8
h = 0.01:
G(8 + h) = G(8 + 0.01) = G(8.01) = −2(8.01)2 + 36(8.01) + 288
= 388.0398
G(8) = −2(8)2 + 36(8) + 228 = 388
Average rate of change of G = G(8.01) −G(8)
0.01
= 388.0398 −388
0.01
= 3.98
Continuing in this way, we get the values in the following table:

Each value is an average rate of change of G. For example, the value corresponding to
h = 0.01 is 3.98, which tells us:
Over the interval [8, 8.01] the price of gold was increasing at an average rate of
$3.98 per hour.
In other words, during the ﬁrst one-hundredth of an hour (or 36 seconds) starting at
t = 8 AM, the price of gold was increasing at an average rate of $3.98 per hour. Put
another way, in those 36 seconds, the price of gold increased at a rate that, if continued,
would have produced an increase of $3.98 in the price of gold during the next hour. We
will return to this example at the beginning of Section 10.5.

FAQs
Recognizing When and How to Compute the Average 
Rate of Change and How to Interpret the Answer
Q: How do I know, by looking at the wording of a problem, that it is asking for an average rate of
change?
A: If a problem does not ask for an average rate of change directly, it might do so indirectly, as
in “On average, how fast is quantity q increasing?” ■
Q: If I know that a problem calls for computing an average rate of change, how should I
compute it? By hand or using technology?
A: All the computations can be done by hand, but when hand calculations are not called for,
using technology might save time. ■
Q: Lots of problems ask us to “interpret” the answer. How do I do that for questions involving
average rates of change?
A: The units of the average rate of change are often the key to interpreting the results: 
The units of the average rate of change of f(x) are units of f(x) per unit of x.
Thus, for instance, if f(x) is the cost, in dollars, of a trip of x miles in length, and the average rate
of change of f is calculated to be 10, then we can say that the cost of a trip rises an average of
$10 for each additional mile. ■

As we look at these shrinking periods of time, we are getting closer to looking at what
happens at the instant t = 8. So it seems reasonable to say that the average rates of
change are approaching the instantaneous rate of change at t = 8, which the table sug-
gests is $4 per hour. This is how fast the price of gold was changing exactly at 8 AM.
At t = 8, the instantaneous rate of change of G(t) is 4
We express this fact mathematically by writing G′(8) = 4 (which we read as “G
prime of 8 equals 4”). Thus,
G′(8) = 4 means that, at t = 8, the instantaneous rate of change of G(t) is 4
The process of letting h get smaller and smaller is called taking the limit as h ap-
proaches 0 (as you recognize if you’ve done the sections on limits). We write h →0 as
shorthand for “h approaches 0.” Thus, taking the limit of the average rates of change as
h →0 gives us the instantaneous rate of change.
Q: All these intervals [8, 8 + h] are intervals to the right of 8. What about small intervals to the
left of 8, such as [7.9, 8]?
A: We can compute the average rate of change of our function for such intervals by choosing h
to be negative (h = −0.1, −0.01, etc.) and using the same difference quotient formula we used
for positive h:
Average rate of change of G over [8 + h, 8] = G(8) −G(8 + h)
8 −(8 + h)
= G(8 + h) −G(8)
h
Here are the results we get using negative h:

Notice that the average rates of change are again getting closer and closer to 4 as h approaches 0,
suggesting once again that the instantaneous rate of change is $4 per hour. ■

quick Example
Instantaneous Rate of Change of f(x) at x = a: Derivative
The instantaneous rate of change of f (x) at x = a is deﬁned as
f ′(a) = lim
h→0
f (a + h) −f (a)
h
f prime of a equals the limit as h approaches 0, of 
the ratio f (a + h) −f (a)
h
The quantity f ′(a) is also called the derivative of f(x) at x = a. Finding the derivative 
of f is called differentiating f .
Units
The units of f ′(a) are the same as the units of the average rate of change: units of f per
unit of x.
If f (x) = −2x2 + 36x + 228, then the two tables above suggest that
f ′(8) = lim
h→0
f (8 + h) −f (8)

= 4
Important Notes
1. Sections 10.1–10.3 discuss limits in some detail. If you have not (yet) covered those
sections, you can trust to your intuition.
2. The formula for the derivative tells us that the instantaneous rate of change is the limit
of the average rates of change [ f (a + h) −f (a)]/h over smaller and smaller inter-
vals. Thus, value of f ′(a) can be approximated by computing the average rate of
change for smaller and smaller values of h, both positive and negative.
3. In this section we will only approximate derivatives. In Section 10.6 we will begin to
see how we ﬁnd the exact values of derivatives.
4. f ′(a) is a number we can calculate, or at least approximate, for various values of a,
as we have done in the example above. Since f ′(a) depends on the value of a, we can
think of f ′ as a function of a. (We return to this idea at the end of this section.) An old
name for f ′ is “the function derived from f ,” which has been shortened to the deriv-
ative of f .
5. It is because f ′ is a function that we sometimes refer to f ′(a) as “the derivative of
f evaluated at a,” or the “derivative of f (x) evaluated at x = a.”
It may happen that the average rates of change [ f (a + h) −f (a)]/h do not ap-
proach any ﬁxed number at all as h approaches zero, or that they approach one number
on the intervals using positive h, and another on those using negative h. If this happens,
we say that f is not differentiable at x = a, or f ′(a) does not exist. When the average
rates of change do approach a ﬁxed limit for both positive and negative h, we say that f
is differentiable at the point x = a, or f ′(a) exists. It is comforting to know that all
polynomials and exponential functions are differentiable at every point. On the other
hand, certain functions are not differentiable. Examples are f (x) = |x| and f (x) = x1/3,
neither of which is differentiable at x = 0 (see Section 10.7).

Example 1 Instantaneous Rate of Change: Numerically 
and Graphically
The air temperature one spring morning, t hours after 7:00 AM, was given by the func-
tion f (t) = 50 + 0.1t4 ◦F (0 ≤t ≤4).
a. How fast was the temperature rising at 9:00 AM?
b. How is the instantaneous rate of change of temperature at 9:00 AM reﬂected in the
graph of temperature vs. time?
Solution
a. We are being asked to ﬁnd the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature at
t = 2, so we need to ﬁnd f ′(2). To do this we examine the average rates of change
f (2 + h) −f (2)
h

for values of h approaching 0. Calculating the average rate of change over [2, 2 + h]
for h = 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 we get the following values (rounded to four
decimal places):*

The average rates of change are clearly approaching the number 3.2, so we can say
that f ′(2) = 3.2. Thus, at 9:00 in the morning, the temperature was rising at the rate
of 3.2◦F per hour.
b. We saw in Section 10.4 that the average rate of change of f over an interval is
the slope of the secant line through the corresponding points on the graph of f . Fig-
ure 23 illustrates this for the intervals [2, 2 + h] with h = 1, 0.5, and 0.1.

All three secant lines pass though the point (2, f (2)) = (2, 51.6) on the graph of f .
Each of them passes through a second point on the curve (the second point is differ-
ent for each secant line) and this second point gets closer and closer to (2, 51.6) as h
gets closer to 0. What seems to be happening is that the secant lines are getting closer
and closer to a line that just touches the curve at (2, 51.6): the tangent line at
(2, 51.6), shown in Figure 24.

Tangent line
Q: What is the slope of this tangent line?
A: Because the slopes of the secant lines are getting closer and closer to 3.2, and because the
secant lines are approaching the tangent line, the tangent line must have slope 3.2. In other
words,
At the point on the graph where x = 2, the slope of the tangent line is f ′(2). ■
Be sure you understand the difference between f (2) and f ′(2): Brieﬂy, f (2) is the value
of f when t = 2, while f ′(2) is the rate at which f is changing when t = 2. Here,
f (2) = 50 + 0.1(2)4 = 51.6◦F
Thus, at 9:00 AM (t = 2), the temperature was 51.6◦F. On the other hand,
f ′(2) = 3.2◦F/hour
Units of slope are units of f per unit of t.
This means that, at 9:00 AM (t = 2), the temperature was increasing at a rate of 3.2◦F
per hour.
Because we have been talking about tangent lines, we should say more about what
they are. A tangent line to a circle is a line that touches the circle in just one point. A tan-
gent line gives the circle “a glancing blow,” as shown in Figure 25.
For a smooth curve other than a circle, a tangent line may touch the curve at more
than one point, or pass through it (Figure 26).

However, all tangent lines have the following interesting property in common: If we
focus on a small portion of the curve very close to the point P—in other words, if we
“zoom in” to the graph near the point P—the curve will appear almost straight, and
almost indistinguishable from the tangent line. (Figure 27).

Secant and Tangent Lines
The slope of the secant line through the points on the graph of f where x = a and

Note It might happen that the tangent line is vertical at some point or does not exist at
all. These are the cases in which f is not differentiable at the given point. (See Sec-
tions 10.6 and 10.7.) ■
We can now give a more precise deﬁnition of what we mean by the tangent line to
a point P on the graph of f at a given point: The tangent line to the graph of f at the
point P(a, f (a)) is the straight line passing through P with slope f ′(a).
Quick Approximation of the Derivative
Q: Do we always need to make tables of difference quotients as above in order to calculate an
approximate value for the derivative?
A: We can usually approximate the value of the derivative by using a single, small value of h. In
the example above, the value h = 0.0001 would have given a pretty good approximation. The
problems with using a fixed value of h are that (1) we do not get an exact answer, only an ap-
proximation of the derivative, and (2) how good an approximation it is depends on the function
we’re differentiating.41 However, with most of the functions we’ll be considering, setting
h = 0.0001 does give us a good approximation. ■
732
Chapter 10
Introduction to the Derivative
Calculating a Quick Approximation of the Derivative
We can calculate an approximate value of f ′(a) by using the formula
f ′(a) ≈f (a + h) −f (a)
h
Rate of change over [a, a + h]
with a small value of h. The value h = 0.0001 often works (but see the next example for
a graphical way of determining a good value to use).
Alternative Formula: the Balanced Difference Quotient
The following alternative formula, which measures the rate of change of f over the in-
terval [a −h, a + h], often gives a more accurate result, and is the one used in many
calculators:
f ′(a) ≈f (a + h) −f (a −h)
2h
Rate of change over [a −h, a + h]
Note For the quick approximations to be valid, the function f must be differentiable;
that is, f ′(a) must exist. ■
Example 2 Quick Approximation of the Derivative
a. Calculate an approximate value of f ′(1.5) if f (x) = x2 −4x.
b. Find the equation of the tangent line at the point on the graph where x = 1.5.
41 In fact, no matter how small the value we decide to use for h, it is possible to craft a function f for which
the difference quotient at a is not even close to f ′(a).

Solution
a. We shall compute both the ordinary difference quotient and the balanced difference
quotient. Using h = 0.0001, the ordinary difference quotient is:
f ′(1.5) ≈f (1.5 + 0.0001) −f (1.5)
0.0001
= f (1.5001) −f (1.5)
0.0001
= (1.50012 −4 × 1.5001) −(1.52 −4 × 1.5)
0.0001
= −0.9999
This answer is accurate to 0.0001; in fact, f ′(1.5) = −1.
Graphically, we can picture this approximation as follows: Zoom in on the curve
using the window 1.5 ≤x ≤1.5001 and measure the slope of the secant line joining
both ends of the curve segment. Figure 28 shows close-up views of the curve and tan-
gent line near the point P in which we are interested, the third view being the
zoomed-in view used for this approximation.

Notice that in the third window the tangent line and curve are indistinguishable. Also,
the point P in which we are interested is on the left edge of the window.

Q: Why can’t we simply put h = 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 01 for an incredibly accurate
approximation to the instantaneous rate of change and be done with it?
A: This approach would certainly work if you were patient enough to do the (thankless) calcu-
lation by hand! However, doing it with the help of technology—even an ordinary calculator—will
cause problems: The issue is that calculators and spreadsheets represent numbers with a maxi-
mum number of significant digits (15 in the case of Excel). As the value of h gets smaller, the
value of f(a + h) gets closer and closer to the value of f(a). For example, if f(x) = 50 + 0.1x4,
Excel might compute
f (2 + 0.000 000 000 000 1) −f (2)
= 51.600 000 000 000 3 −51.6
= 0.000 000 000 000 3
Rounded to 15 digits
and the corresponding difference quotient would be 3, not 3.2 as it should be. If h gets even
smaller, Excel will not be able to distinguish between f(a + h) and f(a) at all, in which case it
will compute 0 for the rate of change. This loss in accuracy when subtracting two very close
numbers is called subtractive error.
Thus, there is a trade-off in lowering the value of h: smaller values of h yield mathematically
more accurate approximations of the derivative, but if h gets too small, subtractive error be-
comes a problem and decreases the accuracy computations that use technology. ■
Leibniz d Notation
We introduced the notation f ′(x) for the derivative of f at x, but there is another inter-
esting notation. We have written the average rate of change as
Average rate of change = f
x
change in f
change in x
As we use smaller and smaller values for x, we approach the instantaneous rate of
change, or derivative, for which we also have the notation d f/dx, due to Leibniz:
Instantaneous rate of change = lim
x→0
f
x = d f
dx
That is, d f/dx is just another notation for f ′(x). Do not think of d f/dx as an actual
quotient of two numbers: remember that we only use an actual quotient f/x to
approximate the value of d f/dx.

In Example 3, we apply the quick approximation method of estimating the
derivative.
Example 3 Velocity
My friend Eric, an enthusiastic baseball player, claims he can “probably” throw a ball
upward at a speed of 100 feet per second (ft/sec).* Our physicist friends tell us that its
height s (in feet) t seconds later would be s = 100t −16t2. Find its average velocity
over the interval [2, 3] and its instantaneous velocity exactly 2 seconds after Eric
throws it.
Solution The graph of the ball’s height as a function of time is shown in
Figure 30. Asking for the velocity is really asking for the rate of change
of height with respect to time. (Why?) Consider average velocity ﬁrst. To
compute the average velocity of the ball from time 2 to time 3, we ﬁrst
compute the change in height:
s = s(3) −s(2) = 156 −136 = 20 ft
Since it rises 20 feet in t = 1 second, we use the deﬁning formula
speed = distance/time to get the average velocity:
Average velocity = s
t = 20
1 = 20 ft/sec
from time t = 2 to t = 3. This is just the difference quotient, so
The average velocity is the average rate of change of height.
To get the instantaneous velocity at t = 2, we ﬁnd the instantaneous rate of change
of height. In other words, we need to calculate the derivative ds/dt at t = 2. Using the
balanced quick approximation described above, we get
ds
dt ≈s(2 + 0.0001) −s(2 −0.0001)
2(0.0001)
= s(2.0001) −s(1.9999)
0.0002
= 100(2.0001) −16(2.0001)2 −(100(1.9999) −16(1.9999)2)
0.0002
= 36 ft/sec
In fact, this happens to be the exact answer; the instantaneous velocity at t = 2 is exactly
36 ft/sec. (Try an even smaller value of h to persuade yourself.)
*Eric’s claim is difﬁcult to believe; 100 ft/sec corresponds to around 68 mph, and professional pitchers can
throw forward at about 100 mph.
Before we go on... If we repeat the calculation in Example 3 at time t = 5, we get
ds
dt = −60 ft/s

The negative sign tells us that the ball is falling at a rate of 60 feet per second at time
t = 5. (How does the fact that it is falling at t = 5 show up on the graph?)

Average and Instantaneous Velocity
For an object moving in a straight line with position s(t) at time t, the average velocity
from time t to time t + h is the average rate of change of position with respect to 
time:

Instantaneous velocity =
Instantaneous rate of change of position
In other words, instantaneous velocity is the derivative of position with respect to 
time.
Here is one last comment on Leibniz notation. In Example 3, we could have written
the velocity either as s′ or as ds/dt, as we chose to do. To write the answer to the ques-
tion, that the velocity at t = 2 sec was 36 ft/sec, we can write either
s′(2) = 36
or
ds
dt
				
t=2
= 36
The notation “|t=2” is read “evaluated at t = 2.” Similarly, if y = f (x), we can write the
instantaneous rate of change of f at x = 5 in either functional notation as
f ′(5)
The derivative of f, evaluated at x = 5
or in Leibniz notation as
dy
dx
				
x=5
The derivative of y, evaluated at x = 5
The latter notation is obviously more cumbersome than the functional notation f ′(5), but
the notation dy/dx has compensating advantages. You should practice using both
notations.
The Derivative Function
The derivative f ′(x) is a number we can calculate, or at least approximate, for various val-
ues of x. Because f ′(x) depends on the value of x, we may think of f ′ as a function of x.
This function is the derivative function.

The following example shows how we can use technology to graph the (approxi-
mate) derivative of a function, where it exists.
Example 4 Tabulating and Graphing the Derivative with Technology
Use technology to obtain a table of values of and graph the derivative of f (x) =
−2x2 + 6x + 5 for values of x starting at −5.
Solution The TI-83 has a built-in function that approximates the derivative, and we can
use it to graph the derivative of a function. In Excel, we need to create the approximation

Derivative Function
If f is a function, its derivative function f ′ is the function whose value f ′(x) is the de-
rivative of f at x. Its domain is the set of all x at which f is differentiable. Equivalently, f ′
associates to each x the slope of the tangent to the graph of the function f at x, or the rate
of change of f at x. The formula for the derivative function is
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
f (x + h) −f (x)

quick Examples 1. Let f (x) = 3x −1. The graph of f is a straight line that has slope 3 everywhere. In
other words, f ′(x) = 3 for every choice of x; that is, f ′ is a constant function.
Original Function f
Derivative Function f ′
f (x) = 3x −1
f ′(x) = 3
2. Given the graph of a function f, we can get a rough sketch of the graph of f ′ by esti-
mating the slope of the tangent to the graph of f at several points, as illustrated below.*
Original Function f
Derivative Function f ′
y = f (x)
y = f ′(x)
For x between −2 and 0, the graph of f is linear with slope −2. As x increases from 0
to 2, the slope increases from −2 to 2. For x larger than 2, the graph of f is linear with
slope 2. (Notice that, when x = 1, the graph of f has a horizontal tangent, so f ′(1) = 0.)

We said that f ′ records the slope of (the tangent line to) the function f at each point.
Notice that the graph of f ′ confirms that the slope of the graph of f is decreasing as
x increases from −5 to 5. Note also that the graph of f reaches a high point at x = 1.5
(the vertex of the parabola). At that point, the slope of the tangent is zero; that is,
f ′(1.5) = 0 as we see in the graph of f ′.

The number N of U.S. households connected to the Internet from the start of 1999 could
be modeled by the logistic function
N(t) =
79.317
1 + 2.2116(1.3854)−t million households
(0 ≤t ≤9)
where t is the number of quarters since the start of 1999.* Graph both N and its deriva-
tive, and determine when Internet usage was growing most rapidly.
Solution Using one of the methods in Example 4, we obtain the graphs shown in
Figure 32.
* The model was obtained In Section 9.4 by logistic regression. Sources for data: Telecommunications Reports
International/New York Times, May 21, 2001, p. C9.
Graph of N
Graph of N ′
Figure 32

From the graph on the right, we see that N ′ reaches a peak somewhere between t = 2
and t = 3 (sometime during the third quarter of 1999). Recalling that N ′ measures the
slope of the graph of N, we can conclude that the graph of N is steepest between t = 2
and t = 3, indicating that, according to the model, the number of U.S. households con-
nected to the Internet was growing most rapidly during the third quarter of 1999. Notice
that this is not so easy to see directly on the graph of N.
To determine the point of maximum growth more accurately, we can zoom in on the
graph of N ′ using the range 2 ≤t ≤3 (Figure 33).

Graph of N ′
Figure 33
We can now see that N ′ reaches its highest point around t = 2.4, so we conclude that the
number of U.S. households connected to the Internet was growing most rapidly shortly
before the midpoint of the third quarter of 1999.
Before we go on... Besides helping us to determine the point of maximum growth, the
graph of N ′ in Example 5 gives us a great deal of additional information. As just one ex-
ample, in Figure 32 we can see that the maximum value of N ′ is approximately 6.5, in-
dicating that Internet usage in the U.S. never grew at a faster rate than about 6.5 million
households per quarter. ■
FAQs
Recognizing When and How to Compute the Instantaneous
Rate of Change 
Q: How do I know, by looking at the wording of a problem, that it is asking for an instantaneous
rate of change?
A: If a problem does not ask for an instantaneous rate of change directly, it might do so indi-
rectly, as in “How fast is quantity q increasing?” or “Find the rate of increase of q.” ■
Q: If I know that a problem calls for estimating an instantaneous rate of change, how 
should I estimate it: with a table showing smaller and smaller values of h, or by using a quick
approximation?
A: For most practical purposes, a quick approximation is accurate enough. Use a table showing
smaller and smaller values of h when you would like to check the accuracy. ■
Q: Which should I use in computing a quick approximation: the balanced difference quotient or
the ordinary difference quotient?
A: In general, the balanced difference quotient gives a more accurate answer. ■

Consider the functions in Exercises 5–8 as representing the value
of an ounce of silver in Indian rupees as a function of the time t
in days.42 Find the average rates of change of R(t) over the time
intervals [t, t + h], where t is as indicated and h = 1, 0.1, and
0.01 days. Hence, estimate the instantaneous rate of change of R
at time t, specifying the units of measurement. (Use smaller
values of h to check your estimates.) hint [see Example 1]
5. ● R(t) = 50t −t2; t = 5
6. ● R(t) = 60t −2t2; t = 3
7. ● R(t) = 100 + 20t3; t = 1
8. ● R(t) = 1000 + 50t −t3; t = 2
Each of the functions in Exercises 9–12 gives the cost to manu-
facture x items. Find the average cost per unit of manufacturing
h more items (i.e., the average rate of change of the total cost) at
a production level of x, where x is as indicated and h = 10 and
1. Hence, estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the total
cost at the given production level x, specifying the units of mea-
surement. (Use smaller values of h to check your estimates.)

The next two exercises are applications of Einstein’s Special
Theory of Relativity and relate to objects that are moving ex-
tremely fast. In science ﬁction terminology, a speed of warp 1 is
the speed of light—about 3 × 108 meters per second. (Thus, for
instance, a speed of warp 0.8 corresponds to 80% of the speed of
light—about 2.4 × 108 meters per second.)
91. ◆ Lorentz Contraction According to Einstein’s Special The-
ory of Relativity, a moving object appears to get shorter to a
stationary observer as its speed approaches the speed of light.
If a spaceship that has a length of 100 meters at rest travels at
a speed of warp p, its length in meters, as measured by a sta-
tionary observer, is given by
L( p) = 100

1 −p2
with domain [0, 1). Estimate L(0.95) and L′(0.95). What do
these ﬁgures tell you?
92. ◆ Time Dilation Another prediction of Einstein’s Special
Theory of Relativity is that, to a stationary observer, clocks
(as well as all biological processes) in a moving object
appear to go more and more slowly as the speed of the ob-
ject approaches that of light. If a spaceship travels at a speed
of warp p, the time it takes for an onboard clock to register
one second, as measured by a stationary observer, will be
given by
T( p) =
1

1 −p2 seconds
with domain [0, 1). Estimate T(0.95) and T ′(0.95). What do
these ﬁgures tell you?

The Derivative: Algebraic Viewpoint
In Section 10.5 we saw how to estimate the derivative of a function using numerical and
graphical approaches. In this section we use an algebraic approach that will give us the
exact value of the derivative, rather than just an approximation, when the function is
speciﬁed algebraically.
This algebraic approach is quite straightforward: Instead of subtracting numbers to
estimate the average rate of change over smaller and smaller intervals, we subtract alge-
braic expressions. Our starting point is the deﬁnition of the derivative in terms of the dif-
ference quotient:
f ′(a) = lim
h→0
f (a + h) −f (a)
h
Example 1 Calculating the Derivative at a Point Algebraically
Let f (x) = x2. Use the deﬁnition of the derivative to compute f ′(3) algebraically.
Solution Substituting a = 3 into the deﬁnition of the derivative, we get:
f ′(3) = lim
h→0
f (3 + h) −f (3)
h

Factor out h
= lim
h→0 (6 + h)

Now we let h approach 0. As h gets closer and closer to 0, the sum 6 + h clearly gets
closer and closer to 6 + 0 = 6. Thus,
f ′(3) = lim
h→0 (6 + h) = 6
As h →0, (6 + h) →6
(Calculations of limits like this are discussed and justiﬁed more fully in Sections 10.2
and 10.3.)
Before we go on... We did the following calculation in Example 1: If f (x) = x2, then
f ′(3) = 6. In other words, the tangent to the graph of y = x2 at the point (3, 9) has slope
6 (Figure 34). ■
There is nothing very special about a = 3 in Example 1. Let’s try to compute f ′(x)
for general x.
Example 2 Calculating the Derivative Function Algebraically
Let f (x) = x2. Use the deﬁnition of the derivative to compute f ′(x) algebraically.
Solution Once again, our starting point is the deﬁnition of the derivative in terms of
the difference quotient:
f ′(x) = lim
h→0
f (x + h) −f (x)
h

h
Cancel the x2.
= lim
h→0
h(2x + h)
h
Factor out h.
= lim
h→0 (2x + h)
Cancel the h.
Now we let h approach 0. As h gets closer and closer to 0, the sum 2x + h clearly gets
closer and closer to 2x + 0 = 2x. Thus,
f ′(x) = lim
h→0 (2x + h) = 2x
This is the derivative function. Now that we have a formula for the derivative of f, we can
obtain f ′(a) for any value of a we choose by simply evaluating f ′ there. For instance,
f ′(3) = 2(3) = 6
as we saw in Example 1.

Before we go on... The graphs of f (x) = x2 and f ′(x) = 2x from Example 2 are
familiar. Their graphs are shown in Figure 35.
When x < 0, the parabola slopes downward, which is reﬂected in the fact that the de-
rivative 2x is negative there. When x > 0, the parabola slopes upward, which is reﬂected
in the fact that the derivative is positive there. The parabola has a horizontal tangent line
at x = 0, reﬂected in the fact that 2x = 0 there. ■

In Example 4, we redo Example 3 of Section 10.5, this time getting an exact, rather
than approximate, answer.
Example 4 Velocity
My friend Eric, an enthusiastic baseball player, claims he can “probably” throw a ball
upward at a speed of 100 feet per second (ft/sec). Our physicist friends tell us that its
height s (in feet) t seconds later would be s(t) = 100t −16t2. Find the ball’s instanta-
neous velocity function and its velocity exactly 2 seconds after Eric throws it.
Solution The instantaneous velocity function is the derivative ds/dt, which we calcu-
late as follow:
ds
dt = lim
h→0
s(t + h) −s(t)
h
Let us compute s(t + h) and s(t) separately:
s(t) = 100t −16t2
s(t + h) = 100(t + h) −16(t + h)2
= 100t + 100h −16(t2 + 2th + h2)
= 100t + 100h −16t2 −32th −16h2
Therefore,
ds
dt = lim
h→0
s(t + h) −s(t)
h
= lim
h→0
100t + 100h −16t2 −32th −16h2 −(100t −16t2)
h

Thus, the velocity exactly 2 seconds after Eric throws it is

t=2
= 100 −32(2) = 36 ft/sec
This veriﬁes the accuracy of the approximation we made in Section 10.5.
Before we go on... From the derivative function in Example 4, we can now describe the
behavior of the velocity of the ball: Immediately on release (t = 0) the ball is traveling
at 100 feet per second upward. The ball then slows down; precisely, it loses 32 feet per
second of speed every second. When, exactly, does the velocity become zero and what
happens after that? ■
Q: Do we always have to calculate the limit of the difference quotient to find a formula for the
derivative function?
A: As it turns out, no. In Section 10.7 we will start to look at shortcuts for finding derivatives
that allow us to bypass the definition of the derivative in many cases. ■
A Function Not Differentiable at a Point
Recall from Section 10.5 that a function is differentiable at a point a if f ′(a) exists; that
is, if the difference quotient [ f (a + h) −f (a)]/h approaches a ﬁxed value as h ap-
proaches 0. In Section 10.5, we mentioned that the function f (x) = |x| is not differen-
tiable at x = 0. In Example 5, we ﬁnd out why.
Example 5 A Function Not Differentiable at 0
Numerically, graphically, and algebraically investigate the differentiability of the func-
tion f (x) = |x| at the points a. x = 1 and b. x = 0.
Solution
a. We compute
f ′(1) = lim
h→0
f (1 + h) −f (1)
h
= lim
h→0
|1 + h| −1
h
Numerically, we can make tables of the values of the average rate of change
(|1 + h| −1)/h for h positive or negative and approaching 0:

From these tables it appears that f ′(1) is equal to 1. We can verify that algebraically:
For h that is sufﬁciently small, 1 + h is positive (even if h is negative) and so
f ′(1) = lim
h→0
1 + h −1

because the graph is a straight line with slope 1 near that point (Figure 36).

Figure 37
For the limit and hence the derivative f ′(0) to exist, the average rates of change should
approach the same number for both positive and negative h. Because they do not, f is not
differentiable at x = 0. We can verify this conclusion algebraically: If h is positive, then
|h| = h, and so the ratio |h|/h is 1, regardless of how small h is. Thus, according to the
values of the difference quotients with h > 0, the limit should be 1. On the other hand if
h is negative, then |h| = −h (positive) and so |h|/h = −1, meaning that the limit should
be −1. Because the limit cannot be both −1 and 1 (it must be a single number for the
derivative to exist), we conclude that f ′(0) does not exist.
To see what is happening graphically, take a look at Figure 37, which shows
zoomed-in views of the graph of f near x = 0.

No matter what scale we use to view the graph, it has a sharp corner at x = 0 and
hence has no tangent line there. Since there is no tangent line at x = 0, the function is
not differentiable there.
Before we go on... If we repeat the computation in Example 5(a) using any nonzero
value for a in place of 1, we see that f is differentiable there as well. If a is positive, we
ﬁnd that f ′(a) = 1 and, if a is negative, f ′(a) = −1. In other words, the derivative func-
tion is
f ′(x) =

−1
if x < 0
1
if x > 0
Of course, f ′(x) is not deﬁned when x = 0. ■

FAQs
Computing Derivatives Algebraically
Q: The algebraic computation of f ′(x) seems to require a number of steps. How do I remem-
ber what to do, and when?
A: If you examine the computations in the examples above, you will find the following pattern:
1. Write out the formula for f ′(x) as the limit of the difference quotient, then substitute
f(x + h) and f(x).
2. Expand and simplify the numerator of the expression, but not the denominator.
3. After simplifying the numerator, factor out an h to cancel with the h in the denominator. If h
does not factor out of the numerator, you might have made an error. (A frequent error is a
wrong sign.)
4. After canceling the h, you should be able to see what the limit is by letting h →0. ■

10.7 Derivatives of Powers, Sums,
and Constant Multiples
So far in this chapter we have approximated derivatives using difference quotients, and
we have done exact calculations using the deﬁnition of the derivative as the limit of a
difference quotient. In general, we would prefer to have an exact calculation, and it is
also very useful to have a formula for the derivative function when we can ﬁnd one.
However, the calculation of a derivative as a limit is often tedious, so it would be nice to
have a quicker method. We discuss the ﬁrst of the shortcut rules in this section. By the
end of Chapter 11, we will be able to ﬁnd fairly quickly the derivative of almost any
function we can write.
Shortcut Formula: The Power Rule
If you look again at Examples 2 and 3 in Section 10.6, you may notice a pattern:
f (x) = x2
⇒
f ′(x) = 2x
f (x) = x3
⇒
f ′(x) = 3x2
quick Examples
Theorem: The Power Rule
If n is any constant and f (x) = xn, then
f ′(x) = nxn−1
1. If f (x) = x2, then f ′(x) = 2x1 = 2x.
2. If f (x) = x3, then f ′(x) = 3x2.
3. If f (x) = x, rewrite as f (x) = x1, so  f ′(x) = 1x0 = 1.
4. If f (x) = 1, rewrite as f (x) = x0,  so  f ′(x) = 0x−1 = 0.
The proof of the power rule involves ﬁrst studying the case when n is a positive integer,
and then studying the cases of other types of exponents (negative integer, rational num-
ber, irrational number). You can ﬁnd a proof at the website.
Example 1 Using the Power Rule for Negative
and Fractional Exponents
Calculate the derivatives of the following:
a. f (x) = 1
x
b. f (x) = 1
x2
c. f (x) = √x
Solution
a. Rewrite* as f (x) = x−1. Then f ′(x) = (−1)x−2 = −1
x2 .
b. Rewrite as f (x) = x−2 . Then f ′(x) = (−2)x−3 = −2
x3 .
c. Rewrite as f (x) = x0.5. Then f ′(x) = 0.5x−0.5 = 0.5
x0.5 . 
Alternatively, rewrite f (x) as x1/2, so that f ′(x) = 1
2x−1/2 =
1
2x1/2 =

Chapter 10
 Proof of the Power Rule

By rewriting the given functions in Example 1 before taking derivatives, we converted
them from rational or radical form (as in, say, 1
x2 or √x) to exponent form (as in x−2
and x0.5) to enable us to use the power rule (see the caution below).
10.7 Derivatives of Powers, Sums, and Constant Multiples
759
Caution
We cannot apply the power rule to terms in the denominators or under square roots. For
example:
1. The derivative of 1
x2 is NOT 1
2x ; but is −2
x3 .
See Example 1(b)
2. The derivative of 
√
x3 is NOT
√
3x2; but is 1.5x0.5.
Rewrite 
√
x3 as x3/2 or x1.5
and apply the power rule
Some of the derivatives in Example 1 are very useful to remember, so we sum-
marize them in Table 1. We suggest that you add to this table as you learn more deriva-
tives. It is extremely helpful to remember the derivatives of common functions such
as 1/x and √x , even though they can be obtained using the power rule as in the above
example.
Another Notation: Differential Notation
Here is a useful notation based on the “d-notation” we discussed in Section 10.5. Dif-
ferential notation is based on an abbreviation for the phrase “the derivative with respect
to x.” For example, we learned that if f (x) = x3, then f ′(x) = 3x2. When we say
“ f ′(x) = 3x2,” we mean the following:
The derivative of x3 with respect to x equals 3x2.
You may wonder why we sneaked in the words “with respect to x.” All this means is that
the variable of the function is x, and not any other variable.66 Since we use the phrase
“the derivative with respect to x” often, we use the following abbreviation.
66 This may seem odd in the case of f (x) = x3 because there are no other variables to worry about. But in ex-
pressions like st3 that involve variables other than x, it is necessary to specify just what the variable of the
function is. This is the same reason that we write “ f (x) = x3” rather than just “ f = x3.”

Theorem: Derivatives of Sums, Differences, and Constant Multiples
If f (x) and g(x) are any two differentiable functions, and if c is any constant, then the
functions f (x) + g(x) and cf (x) are differentiable, and
[ f (x) ± g(x)]′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x)
[cf (x)]′ = cf ′(x)
In Words:
• The derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, and the derivative of a differ-
ence is the difference of the derivatives.
• The derivative of c times a function is c times the derivative of the function.

your revenue function is the curve on the left, then the derivative of my revenue
function is the curve on the right.

the proﬁt, P(t) = R(t) −C(t), and the rate of change of the proﬁt is
P′(t) = R′(t) −C′(t)
In words: The derivative of the proﬁt is the derivative of revenue minus the derivative
of cost.

The proof of the rule for constant multiples is similar.

Notice that in Example 2(a) we had three terms in the expression for f (x), not just
two. By applying the rule for sums and differences twice, we saw that the derivative of
a sum or difference of three terms is the sum or difference of the derivatives of the terms.
(One of those terms had zero derivatives, so the ﬁnal answer had only two terms.) In
fact, the derivative of a sum or difference of any number of terms is the sum or differ-
ence of the derivatives of the terms. Put another way, to take the derivative of a sum or
difference of any number of terms, we take derivatives term by term.
Note Nothing forces us to use only x as the independent variable when taking deriva-
tives (although it is traditional to give x preference). For instance, part (a) in Example 2
can be rewritten as
d
dt (3t2 + 2t −4) = 6t + 2
d
dt means “derivative with respect to t”.
or
d
du (3u2 + 2u −4) = 6u + 2
d
du means “derivative with respect to u”.

In the examples above, we saw instances of the following important facts. (Think
about these graphically to see why they must be true.)

In Example 5 of Section 10.6 we saw that f (x) = |x| fails to be differentiable at x = 0.
In the next example we use the power rule and ﬁnd more functions not differentiable at
a point.
Example 3 Functions Not Differentiable at a Point
Find the natural domains of the derivatives of f (x) = x1/3 and g(x) = x2/3, and
h(x) = |x|.
Solution Let’s ﬁrst look at the functions f and g. By the power rule,
f ′(x) = 1
3x−2/3 =
1
3x2/3
and
g′(x) = 2
3x−1/3 =
2
3x1/3
f ′(x) and g′(x) are deﬁned only for nonzero values of x, and their natural domains con-
sist of all real numbers except 0. Thus, the derivatives f ′ and g′ do not exist at x = 0. In
other words, f and g are not differentiable at x = 0. If we look at Figure 38, we notice
why these functions fail to be differentiable at x = 0: The graph of f has a vertical tan-
gent line at 0. Because a vertical line has undeﬁned slope, the derivative is undeﬁned at
that point. The graph of g comes to a sharp point (called a cusp) at 0, so it is not mean-
ingful to speak about a tangent line at that point; therefore, the derivative of g is not de-
ﬁned there. (Actually, there is a reasonable candidate for the tangent line at x = 0, but it
is the vertical line again.)
We can also detect this nondifferentiability by computing some difference quotients
numerically. In the case of f (x) = x1/3, we get the following table:
x
y
y  x13

y

suggesting that the difference quotients [ f (0 + h) −f (0)]/h grow large without bound
rather than approach any ﬁxed number as h approaches 0. (Can you see how the behav-
ior of the difference quotients in the table is reﬂected in the graph?)

Now we return to the function h(x) = |x| discussed in Example 5 of Section 10.6.
We can write
|x| =

−x
if x < 0
x
if x > 0
Hence, by the power rule (think of x as x1):
f ′(x) =

−1
if x < 0
1
if x > 0
Q: So does that mean there is no single formula for the derivative of |x|?
A: Actually, there is a convenient formula. Consider the ratio
|x|
x
■
If x is positive then |x| = x, so |x|/x = x/x = 1. On the other hand, if x is negative then
|x| = −x, so |x|/x = −x/x = −1. In other words,
|x|
x =

−1
if x < 0
1
if x > 0
which is exactly the formula we obtained for f ′(x). In other words:

using Technology
If you try to graph the function
f(x)  x2/3 using the format
X^(2/3)
you may get only the right-hand
portion of Figure 38 because
graphing utilities are (often) not
programmed to raise negative
numbers to fractional exponents.
(However, many will handle
X^(1/3) correctly, as a special
case they recognize.) To avoid
this difﬁculty, you can take ad-
vantage of the identity
x2/3 = (x2)1/3
so that it is always a nonnegative
number that is being raised to a
fractional exponent. Thus, use
the format
(X^2)^(1/3)
to obtain both portions of the
graph.
An Application to Limits: L’Hospital’s Rule (Optional)
The limits that caused us some trouble in Sections 10.1–10.3 are those of the form
limx→a f (x) in which we cannot just substitute x = a, such as
lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2
Substituting x = 2 yields 0
0 .
lim
x→+∞
2x −4
x −1
Substituting x = +∞yields∞
∞.
L’Hospital’s rule gives us an alternate way of computing limits such as these without the
need to do any preliminary simpliﬁcation. It also allows us to compute some limits for
which algebraic simpliﬁcation does not work.67
67 Guillame François Antoine Marquis de L’Hospital (1661–1704) wrote the ﬁrst textbook on calculus, Analyse
des inﬁniment petits pour l’intelligence des lignes courbes, in 1692. The rule now known as L’Hospital’s Rule
appeared ﬁrst in this book.

The proof of L’Hospital’s rule is beyond the scope of this text.68

Theorem: L’Hospital’s Rule
If f and g are two differentiable functions such that substituting x = a in the expression
f (x)
g(x) gives either 0
0 or ∞
∞, then
lim
x→a
f (x)
g(x) = lim
x→a
f ′(x)
g′(x)
That is, we can replace f (x) and g(x) with their derivatives and try again to take
the limit.
1. Substituting x = 2 in x3 −8
x −2 yields 0
0. Therefore, L’Hospital’s rule applies and
lim
x→2
x3 −8
x −2 = lim
x→2
3x2

= 12
2. Substituting x = +∞in 2x −4
x −1 yields ∞
∞. Therefore, L’Hospital’s rule applies and
lim
x→+∞
2x −4
x −1 =
lim
x→+∞
2
1 = 2
Example 4 Applying L’Hospital’s Rule
Check whether L’Hospital’s rule applies to each of the following limits. If it does, use it
to evaluate the limit. Otherwise, use some other method to evaluate the limit.
a. lim
x→1
x2 −2x + 1
4x3 −3x2 −6x + 5
b. lim
x→+∞
2x2 −4x
5x3 −3x + 5
c. lim
x→1
x −1
x3 −3x2 + 3x −1
d. lim
x→1
x
x3 −3x2 + 3x −1
Solution
a. Setting x = 1 yields
1 −2 + 1
4 −3 −6 + 5 = 0
0
Therefore L’Hospital’s rule applies and
lim
x→1
x2 −2x + 1
4x3 −3x2 −6x + 5 = lim
x→1
2x −2
12x2 −6x −6
68 A proof of L’Hospital’s rule can be found in most advanced calculus textbooks.

We are left with a closed-form function. However, we cannot substitute x = 1 to
ﬁnd the limit because the function (2x −2)/(12x2 −6x −6) is still not deﬁned at
x = 1. In fact, if we set x = 1, we again get 0/0. Thus, L’Hospital’s rule applies
again, and
lim
x→1
2x −2
12x2 −6x −6 = lim
x→1
2
24x −6
Once again we have a closed-form function, but this time it is deﬁned when x = 1,
giving
2
24 −6 = 1
9
Thus,
lim
x→1
x2 −2x + 1
4x3 −3x2 −6x + 5 = 1
9
b. Setting x = +∞yields ∞
∞, so
lim
x→+∞
2x2 −4x
5x3 −3x + 5 =
lim
x→+∞
4x −4
15x2 −3
Setting x = +∞again yields ∞
∞, so we can apply the rule again to obtain
lim
x→+∞
4x −4
15x2 −3 =
lim
x→+∞
4
30x
Note that we cannot apply L’Hospital’s rule a third time because setting x = +∞
yields 4/∞. However, we can easily see now that the limit is zero. (Refer to Exam-
ple 4(d) in Section 10.3.)
c. Setting x = 1 yields 0/0 so, by L’Hospital’s rule,
lim
x→1
x −1
x3 −3x2 + 3x −1 = lim
x→1
1
3x2 −6x + 3
We are left with a closed-form function that is still not deﬁned at x = 1. Further,
L’Hospital’s rule no longer applies because putting x = 1 yields 1/0. To investigate
this limit, we must either graph it or create a table of values. If we use either method,
we ﬁnd that
lim
x→1
x −1
x3 −3x2 + 3x −1 = +∞
d. Setting x = 1 in the expression yields 1/0, so L’Hospital’s rule does not apply here.
If we graph the function or create a table of values, we ﬁnd that the limit does not
exist.

FAQs
Using the Rules and Recognizing When a Function Is 
Not Differentiable
Q: I would like to say that the derivative of 5x2 −8x + 4 is just 10x −8 without having to go
through all that stuff about derivatives of sums and constant multiples. Can I simply forget
about all the rules and write down the answer?
A: We developed the rules for sums and constant multiples precisely for that reason: so that
we could simply write down a derivative without having to think about it too hard. So, you are
perfectly justified in simply writing down the derivative without going through the rules, but
bear in mind that what you are really doing is applying the power rule, the rule for sums, and the
rule for multiples over and over. ■
Q: Is there a way of telling from its formula whether a function f is not differentiable at a
point?
A: Here are some indicators to look for in the formula for f:
• The absolute value of some expression; f may not be differentiable at points where that
expression is zero.
Example: f(x) = 3x2 −|x −4| is not differentiable at x = 4.
• A fractional power smaller than 1 of some expression; f may not be differentiable at points
where that expression is zero.
Example: f(x) = (x2 −16)2/3 is not differentiable at x = ±4. ■

Chapter 10
Introduction to the Derivative
10.8 A First Application: Marginal Analysis
In Chapter 1, we considered linear cost functions of the form C(x) = mx + b, where C
is the total cost, x is the number of items, and m and b are constants. The slope m is the
marginal cost. It measures the cost of one more item. Notice that the derivative of
C(x) = mx + b is C′(x) = m. In other words, for a linear cost function, the marginal
cost is the derivative of the cost function.
In general, we make the following deﬁnition.
quick Example
Marginal Cost
A cost function speciﬁes the total cost C as a function of the number of items x. In other
words, C(x) is the total cost of x items. The marginal cost function is the derivative
C′(x) of the cost function C(x). It measures the rate of change of cost with respect to x.
Units
The units of marginal cost are units of cost (dollars, say) per item.
Interpretation
We interpret C′(x) as the approximate cost of one more item.*
If C(x) = 400x + 1000 dollars, then the marginal cost function is C′(x) = $400 per
item (a constant).
* See Example 1 below.
† You might well ask where on earth this formula came from. There are two approaches to obtaining cost func-
tions in real life: analytical and empirical. The analytical approach is to calculate the cost function from
scratch. For example, in the above situation, we might have ﬁxed costs of $150,000, plus a production cost of
$20 per CD player. The term 0.0001x2 may reﬂect a cost saving for high levels of production, such as a bulk
discount in the cost of electronic components. In the empirical approach, we ﬁrst obtain the cost at several
different production levels by direct observation. This gives several points on the (as yet unknown) cost ver-
sus production level graph. Then ﬁnd the equation of the curve that best ﬁts these points, usually using
regression.
Example 1 Marginal Cost
Suppose that the cost in dollars to manufacture portable CD players is given by
C(x) = 150,000 + 20x −0.0001x2
where x is the number of CD players manufactured.† Find the marginal cost function
C′(x) and use it to estimate the cost of manufacturing the 50,001st CD player.
Solution Since
C(x) = 150,000 + 20x −0.0001x2

10.8 A First Application: Marginal Analysis
773
the marginal cost function is
C′(x) = 20 −0.0002x
The units of C′(x) are units of C (dollars) per unit of x (CD players). Thus, C′(x) is mea-
sured in dollars per CD player.
The cost of the 50,001st CD player is the amount by which the total cost would rise
if we increased production from 50,000 CD players to 50,001. Thus, we need to know
the rate at which the total cost rises as we increase production. This rate of change is
measured by the derivative, or marginal cost, which we just computed. At x = 50,000,
we get
C′(50,000) = 20 −0.0002(50,000) = $10 per CD player
In other words, we estimate that the 50,001st CD player will cost approximately $10.
+Before we go on... In Example 1, the marginal cost is really only an approximation to
the cost of the 50,001st CD player:
C′(50,000) ≈C(50,001) −C(50,000)
1
Set h = 1 in the deﬁnition of the derivative
= C(50,001) −C(50,000)
= Cost of the 50,001st CD player
The exact cost of the 50,001st CD player is
C(50,001) −C(50,000) = [150,000 + 20(50,001) −0.0001(50,001)2]
−[150,000 + 20(50,000) −0.0001(50,000)2]
= $9.9999
So, the marginal cost is a good approximation to the actual cost.
Graphically, we are using the tangent line to approximate the cost function near a
production level of 50,000. Figure 39 shows the graph of the cost function together with
the tangent line at x = 50,000. Notice that the tangent line is essentially indistinguish-
able from the graph of the function for some distance on either side of 50,000.

Notes
1. In general, the difference quotient [C(x + h) −C(x)]/h gives the average cost per
item to produce h more items at a current production level of x items. (Why?)
2. Notice that C′(x) is much easier to calculate than [C(x + h) −C(x)]/h. (Try it.) ■

Chapter 10
Introduction to the Derivative
We can extend the idea of marginal cost to include other functions, like revenue and
proﬁt:
Marginal Revenue and Profit
A revenue or proﬁt function speciﬁes the total revenue R or proﬁt P as a function of the
number of items x. The derivatives, R′(x) and P′(x) of these functions are called the
marginal revenue and marginal proﬁt functions. They measure the rate of change of
revenue and proﬁt with respect to x.
Units
The units of marginal revenue and proﬁt are the same as those of marginal cost: dollars
(or euros, pesos, etc.) per item.
Interpretation
We interpret R′(x) and P′(x) as the approximate revenue and proﬁt from the sale of one
more item.
Example 2 Marginal Revenue and Profit
You operate an iPod customizing service (a typical customized iPod might have a cus-
tom color case with blinking lights and a personalized logo). The cost to refurbish x
iPods in a month is calculated to be
C(x) = 0.25x2 + 40x + 1000 dollars
You charge customers $80 per iPod for the work.
a. Calculate the marginal revenue and proﬁt functions. Interpret the results.
b. Compute the revenue and proﬁt, and also the marginal revenue and proﬁt, if you
have refurbished 20 units this month. Interpret the results.
c. For which value of x is the marginal proﬁt is zero? Interpret your answer.
Solution
a. We ﬁrst calculate the revenue and proﬁt functions:
R(x) = 80x
P(x) = R(x) −C(x)
= 80x −(0.25x2 + 40x + 1000)
P(x) = −0.25x2 + 40x −1000
The marginal revenue and proﬁt functions are then the derivatives:
Marginal revenue = R′(x) = 80
Marginal Proﬁt = P′(x) = −0.5x + 40
Interpretation: R′(x) gives the approximate revenue from the refurbishing of one
more item, and P′(x) gives the approximate proﬁt from the refurbishing of one more
item. Thus, if x iPods have been refurbished in a month, you will earn a revenue of
$80 and make a proﬁt of approximately $(−0.5x + 40) if you refurbish one more that
month.
Revenue  Price  Quantity
Proﬁt  Revenue  Cost

10.8 A First Application: Marginal Analysis
775
Notice that the marginal revenue is a constant, so you earn the same revenue
($80) for each iPod you refurbish. However, the marginal proﬁt, $(−0.5x + 40), de-
creases as x increases, so your additional proﬁt is about 50¢ less for each additional
iPod you refurbish.
b. From part (a), the revenue, proﬁt, marginal revenue, and marginal proﬁt functions
are
R(x) = 80x
P(x) = −0.25x2 + 40x −1000
R′(x) = 80
P′(x) = −0.5x + 40
Because you have refurbished x = 20 iPods this month, x = 20, so
R(20) = 80(20) = $1600
P(20) = −0.25(20)2 + 40(20) −1000 = −$300
R′(20) = $80 per unit
P′(20) = −0.5(20) + 40 = $30 per unit
Interpretation: If you refurbish 20 iPods in a month, you will earn a total revenue of
$160 and a proﬁt of −$300 (indicating a loss of $300). Refurbishing one more iPod
that month will earn you an additional revenue of $80 and an additional proﬁt of
about $30.
c. The marginal proﬁt is zero when P′(x) = 0
−0.5x + 40 = 0
x = 40
0.5 = 80 iPods
Thus, if you refurbish 80 iPods in a month, refurbishing one more will get you (ap-
proximately) zero additional proﬁt. To understand this further, let us take a look at the
graph of the proﬁt function, shown in Figure 40.
Notice that the graph is a parabola (the proﬁt function is quadratic) with vertex at the
point x = 80, where P′(x) = 0, so the proﬁt is a maximum at this value of x.

+Before we go on... In general, setting P′(x) = 0 and solving for x will always give the
exact values of x for which the proﬁt peaks as in Figure 40, assuming there is such a
value. We recommend that you graph the proﬁt function to check whether the proﬁt is
indeed a maximum at such a point. ■
Example 3 Marginal Product
A consultant determines that Precision Manufacturers’ annual proﬁt (in dollars) is
given by
P(n) = −200,000 + 400,000n −4600n2 −10n3
(10 ≤n ≤50)
where n is the number of assembly-line workers it employs.
a. Compute P′(n). P′(n) is called the marginal product at the employment level 
of n assembly-line workers. What are its units?

b. Calculate P(20) and P′(20), and interpret the results.
c. Precision Manufacturers currently employs 20 assembly-line workers and is 
considering laying off some of them. What advice would you give the company’s
management?
Solution
a. Taking the derivative gives
P′(n) = 400,000 −9200n −30n2
The units of P′(n) are proﬁt (in dollars) per worker.
b. Substituting into the formula for P(n), we get
P(20) = −200,000 + 400,000(20) −4600(20)2 −10(20)3 = $5,880,000
Thus, Precision Manufacturer will make an annual proﬁt of $5,880,000 if it employs
20 assembly-line workers. On the other hand,
P′(20) = 400,000 −9200(20) −30(20)2 = $204,000/worker
Thus, at an employment level of 20 assembly-line workers, annual proﬁt is increasing
at a rate of $204,000 per additional worker. In other words, if the company were to
employ one more assembly-line worker, its annual proﬁt would increase by approxi-
mately $204,000.
c. Because the marginal product is positive, proﬁts will increase if the company in-
creases the number of workers and will decrease if it decreases the number of work-
ers, so your advice would be to hire additional assembly-line workers. Downsizing
their assembly-line workforce would reduce their annual proﬁts.
+Before we go on... In Example 3, it would be interesting for Precision Manufacturers
to ascertain how many additional assembly-line workers they should hire to obtain the
maximum annual proﬁt. Taking our cue from Example 2, we suspect that such a value of
n would correspond to a point where P′(n) = 0. Figure 41 shows the graph of P, and on
it we see that the highest point of the graph is indeed a point where the tangent line is
horizontal; that is, P′(n) = 0, and occurs somewhere between n = 35 and 40.
To compute this value of n more accurately, set P′(n) = 0 and solve for n:
P′(n) = 400,000 −9200n −30n2 = 0
or
40,000 −920n −3n2 = 0
We can now obtain n using the quadratic formula:
n = −b ±

≈−345.3 or 38.6
The only meaningful solution is the positive one, n ≈38.6 workers, and we conclude
that the company should employ between 38 and 39 assembly-line workers for a

10.8 A First Application: Marginal Analysis
777
maximum proﬁt. To see which gives the larger proﬁt, 38 or 39, we check:
P(38) = $7,808,880
while
P(39) = $7,810,210
This tells us that the company should employ 39 assembly-line workers for a maximum
proﬁt. Thus, instead of laying off any of its 20 assembly-line workers, the company
should hire 19 additional assembly line workers for a total of 39. ■
Average Cost
Example 4 Average Cost
Suppose the cost in dollars to manufacture portable CD players is given by
C(x) = 150,000 + 20x −0.0001x2
where x is the number of CD players manufactured. (This is the cost equation we saw in
Example 1.)
a. Find the average cost per CD player if 50,000 CD players are manufactured.
b. Find a formula for the average cost per CD player if x CD players are manufactured.
This function of x is called the average cost function, ¯C(x).
Solution
a. The total cost of manufacturing 50,000 CD players is given by
C(50,000) = 150,000 + 20(50,000) −0.0001(50,000)2
= $900,000
Because 50,000 CD players cost a total of $900,000 to manufacture, the average cost
of manufacturing one CD player is this total cost divided by 50,000:
¯C(50,000) = 900,000
50,000 = $18.00 per CD player
Thus, if 50,000 CD players are manufactured, each CD player costs the manufacturer
an average of $18.00 to manufacture.
b. If we replace 50,000 by x, we get the general formula for the average cost of manu-
facturing x CD players:

Average Cost
Given a cost function C, the average cost of the ﬁrst x items is given by
¯C(x) = C(x)
x
The average cost is distinct from the marginal cost C′(x), which tells us the approxi-
mate cost of the next item.
For the cost function C(x) = 20x + 100 dollars
Marginal Cost = C′(x) = $20 per additional item
Average Cost = ¯C(x) = C(x)
x
= 20x + 100
x
= $(20 + 100/x) per item

+Before we go on... Average cost and marginal cost convey different but related infor-
mation. The average cost ¯C(50,000) = $18 that we calculated in Example 4 is the cost
per item of manufacturing the ﬁrst 50,000 CD players, whereas the marginal cost
C′(50,000) = $10 that we calculated in Example 1 gives the (approximate) cost of
manufacturing the next CD player. Thus, according to our calculations, the ﬁrst 50,000
CD players cost an average of $18 to manufacture, but it costs only about $10 to manu-
facture the next one. Note that the marginal cost at a production level of 50,000 CD
players is lower than the average cost. This means that the average cost to manufacture
CDs is going down with increasing volume. (Think about why.)
Figure 42 shows the graphs of average and marginal cost. Notice how the decreas-
ing marginal cost seems to pull the average cost down with it. ■

CAS E  STU DY:
Reducing Sulfur Emissions
The Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) wishes to
formulate a policy that will encourage utilities to re-
duce sulfur emissions. Its goal is to reduce annual emis-
sions of sulfur dioxide by a total of 10 million tons from
the current level of 25 million tons by imposing a ﬁxed
charge for every ton of sulfur released into the environ-
ment per year. As a consultant to the EPA, you must
determine the amount to be charged per ton of sulfur
emissions.
You have the following data, which show the mar-
ginal cost to the utility industry of reducing sulfur emissions at several levels of
reduction.86
86 These ﬁgures were produced in a computerized study of reducing sulfur emissions from the 1980 level by
the given amounts. SOURCE: Congress of the United States, Congressional Budget Ofﬁce, Curbing Acid
Rain: Cost, Budget and Coal Market Effects (Washington, DC: Government Printing Ofﬁce, 1986): xx, xxii,
23, 80.

Marginal Cost ($ per ton)
270
360
779
If C(q) is the cost of removing q tons of sulfur dioxide, the table tells you that
C′(8,000,000) = $270 per ton, C′(10,000,000) = $360 per ton, and C′(12,000,000)
= $779 per ton. Recalling that C′(q) is the slope of the tangent to the graph of the cost
function, you can see from the table that this slope is positive and increasing as q
increases, so the graph of this cost function has the general shape shown in Figure 42.
(Notice that the slope is increasing as you move to the right.) Thus, the utility
industry has no cost incentive to reduce emissions. What you would like to do—if the
goal of reducing total emissions by 10 million tons is to be reached—is to alter this cost
curve so that it has the general shape shown in Figure 43.
In this curve, the cost D to utilities is lowest at a reduction level of 10 million
tons, so if the utilities act to minimize cost, they can be expected to reduce emissions by
10 million tons, which is the EPA goal. From the graph, you can see that
D′(10,000,000) = $0 per ton, whereas D′(q) is negative for q < 10,000,000.
At ﬁrst you are bothered by the fact that you were not given a cost function. Only
the marginal costs were supplied, but you decide to work as best you can without know-
ing the original cost function C(q).
You now assume that the EPA will impose an annual emission charge of $k per
ton of sulfur released into the environment. It is your job to calculate k. Because you
are working with q as the independent variable, you decide that it would be best to
formulate the emission charge as a function of q, where q represents the amount by
which sulfur emissions are reduced. The relationship between the annual sulfur emis-
sions and the amount q by which emissions are reduced from the original 25 million
tons is given by
Annual sulfur emissions  original emissions  amount of reduction

Creatas/Superstock

Thus, the total annual emission charge to the utilities is 
k(25,000,000 −q) = 25,000,000k −kq
This results in a total cost to the utilities of
Total cost  Cost of reducing emissions  emission charge
D(q) = C(q) + 25,000,000k −kq
Even though you have no idea of the form of C(q), you remember that the derivative of
a sum is the sum of the derivatives, so you differentiate both sides and obtain
D′(q) = C′(q) + 0 −k
The derivative of kq is k (the slope).
= C′(q) −k
Remember that you want
D′(10,000,000) = 0
Thus,
C′(10,000,000) −k = 0
Referring to the table, you see that
360 −k = 0
so
k = $360 per ton
In other words, all you need to do is set the emission charge at k = $360 per ton of sulfur
emitted. Further, to ensure that the resulting curve will have the general shape shown in
Figure 2, you would like to have D′(q) negative for q < 10,000,000 and positive for
q > 10,000,000. To check this, write
D′(q) = C′(q) −k
= C′(q) −360
and refer to the table to obtain
D′(8,000,000) = 270 −360 = −90 < 0
✔
and
D′(12,000,000) = 779 −360 = 419 > 0
✔
Thus, based on the given data, the resulting curve will have the shape you require. You
therefore inform the EPA that an annual emissions charge of $360 per ton of sulfur re-
leased into the environment will create the desired incentive: to reduce sulfur emissions
by 10 million tons per year.
One week later, you are informed that this charge would be unrealistic because the
utilities cannot possibly afford such a cost. You are asked whether there is an alternative
plan that accomplishes the 10-million-ton reduction goal and yet is cheaper to the utili-
ties by $5 billion per year. You then look at your expression for the emission charge
25,000,000k −kq
and notice that, if you decrease this amount by $5 billion, the derivative will not change
at all because the derivative of a constant is zero. Thus, you propose the following
788
Chapter 10
Introduction to the Derivative

revised formula for the emission charge:
25,000,000k −kq −5,000,000,000
= 25,000,000(360) −360q −5,000,000,000
= 4,000,000,000 −360q
At the expected reduction level of 10 million tons, the total amount paid by the utilities
will then be
4,000,000,000 −360(10,000,000) = $400,000,000
Thus, your revised proposal is the following: Impose an annual emissions charge of
$360 per ton of sulfur released into the environment and hand back $5 billion in the
form of subsidies. The effect of this policy will be to cause the utilities industry to
reduce sulfur emissions by 10 million tons per year and will result in $400 million in
annual revenues to the government.
Notice that this policy also provides an incentive for the utilities to search for
cheaper ways to reduce emissions. For instance, if they lowered costs to the point where
they could achieve a reduction level of 12 million tons, they would have a total emission
charge of
4,000,000,000 −360(12,000,000) = −$320,000,000
The fact that this is negative means that the government would be paying the utilities
industry $320 million more in annual subsidies than the industry is paying in per ton
emission charges.
Exercises
1. Excluding subsidies, what should the annual emission charge be if the goal is to
reduce sulfur emissions by 8 million tons?
2. Excluding subsidies, what should the annual emission charge be if the goal is to
reduce sulfur emissions by 12 million tons?
3. What is the marginal emission charge in your revised proposal (as stated before the
exercise set)? What is the relationship between the marginal cost of reducing sulfur
emissions before emissions charges are implemented and the marginal emission
charge, at the optimal reduction under your revised proposal?
4. We said that the revised policy provided an incentive for utilities to ﬁnd cheaper ways
to reduce emissions. How would C(q) have to change to make 12 million tons the
optimum reduction?
5. What change in C(q) would make 8 million tons the optimum reduction?
6. If the scenario in Exercise 5 took place, what would the EPA have to do in order to
make 10 million tons the optimal reduction once again?
7. Due to intense lobbying by the utility industry, you are asked to revise the proposed
policy so that the utility industry will pay no charge if sulfur emissions are reduced by
the desired 10 million tons. How can you accomplish this?
8. Suppose that instead of imposing a ﬁxed charge per ton of emission, you decide to use
a sliding scale, so that the total charge to the industry for annual emissions of x tons
will be $kx2 for some k. What must k be to again make 10 million tons the optimum
reduction? [The derivative of kx2 is 2kx.]

Solution with Technology On the TI-83/84, the easiest

which calculates balanced difference quotients.

Alternatively, we can enter the balanced difference
quotient directly:
Y2=(Y1(X+0.001)-Y1(X-0.001))/0.002
(The TI-83 uses h = 0.001 by default in the balanced
difference quotient when calculating nDeriv, but this
can be changed by giving a value of h as a fourth

From the results shown above, we ﬁnd that the difference quotient quick approximation is −0.9999 and that the balanced
difference quotient quick approximation is −1, which is in fact it is the exact value of f ′(1.5). See the discussion in the
text for the calculation of the equation of the tangent line.

You cannot paste the difference quotient formula into cell C102. (Why?) Notice that this worksheet uses the ordinary
difference quotients, [ f (x + h) −f (x)]/h.
If you prefer, you can use balanced difference quotients
[ f (x + h) −f (x −h)]/(2h), in which case cells C2 and C102 would both have to be left blank.
We then graph the function and the derivative on different graphs as follows:

You are on the board of directors at Fullcourt Academic Press. The sales director of the high
school division has just burst into your ofﬁce with a proposal for a major expansion strategy
based on the assumption that the number of high school seniors in the U.S. will be growing at
a rate of at least 20,000 per year through the year 2005. Because the ﬁgures actually appear
to be leveling off, you are suspicious about this estimate. You would like to devise a model

11.1
Introduction
In Chapter 10 we studied the concept of the derivative of a function, and we saw some of
the applications for which derivatives are useful. However, the only functions we could
differentiate easily were sums of terms of the form axn, where a and n are constants. 
In this chapter we develop techniques that help us differentiate any closed-form
function—that is, any function, no matter how complicated, that can be speciﬁed by a for-
mula involving powers, radicals, exponents, and logarithms. (In a later chapter, we will
discuss how to add trigonometric functions to this list.) We also show how to ﬁnd the de-
rivatives of functions that are only speciﬁed implicitly—that is, functions for which we
are not given an explicit formula for y in terms of x but only an equation relating x and y.
The Product and Quotient Rules
We know how to ﬁnd the derivatives of functions that are sums of powers, like polyno-
mials. In general, if a function is a sum or difference of functions whose derivatives we
know, then we know how to ﬁnd its derivative. But what about products and quotients of
functions whose derivatives we know? For instance, how do we calculate the derivative
of something like x2/(x + 1)? The derivative of x2/(x + 1) is not, as one might suspect,
2x/1 = 2x. That calculation is based on an assumption that the derivative of a quotient
is the quotient of the derivatives. But it is easy to see that this assumption is false: For
instance, the derivative of 1/x is not 0/1 = 0, but −1/x2. Similarly, the derivative of a
product is not the product of the derivatives: For instance, the derivative of x = 1 · x is
not 0 · 1 = 0, but 1.
To identify the correct method of computing the derivatives of products and quo-
tients, let’s look at a simple example. We know that the daily revenue resulting from the
sale of q items per day at a price of p dollars per item is given by the product, R = pq
dollars. Suppose you are currently selling wall posters on campus. At this time your
daily sales are 50 posters, and sales are increasing at a rate of 4 per day. Furthermore,
you are currently charging $10 per poster, and you are also raising the price at a rate of
$2 per day. Let’s use this information to estimate how fast your daily revenue is in-
creasing. In other words, let us estimate the rate of change, d R/dt, of the revenue R.
There are two contributions to the rate of change of daily revenue: the increase in
daily sales and the increase in the unit price. We have
d R
dt due to increasing price: $2 per day × 50 posters = $100 per day
d R
dt due to increasing sales: $10 per poster × 4 posters per day = $40 per day
Thus, we estimate the daily revenue to be increasing at a rate of $100 + $40 = $140 per
day. Let us translate what we have said into symbols:
d R
dt due to increasing price: dp
dt × q
d R
dt due to increasing sales: p × dq
dt
Thus, the rate of change of revenue is given by
d R
dt = dp
dt q + p dq
dt

algebra Review
For this chapter, you should
be familiar with the algebra
reviewed in Chapter 0,
Sections 3 and 4.

Because R = pq, we have discovered the following rule for differentiating a product:
d
dt ( pq) =dp
dt q + p dq
dt
The derivative of a product is the derivative of the ﬁrst times
the second, plus the ﬁrst times the derivative of the second.
This rule and a similar rule for differentiating quotients are given next, and also a dis-
cussion of how these results are proved rigorously.

If f (x) and g(x) are differentiable functions of x, then so is their product f (x)g(x), and
d
dx [ f (x)g(x)] = f ′(x)g(x) + f (x)g′(x)
Product Rule in Words
The derivative of a product is the derivative of the ﬁrst times the second, plus the ﬁrst
times the derivative of the second.
f (x) = x2 and g(x) = 3x −1 are both differentiable functions of x, and so their product
x2(3x −1) is differentiable, and

tient x3/(x2 + 1) is differentiable, and

Notes
1. Don’t try to remember the rules by the symbols we have used, but remember them in
words. (The slogans are easy to remember, even if the terms are not precise.)
2. One more time: The derivative of a product is NOT the product of the derivatives,
and the derivative of a quotient is NOT the quotient of the derivatives. To ﬁnd the

derivative of a product, you must use the product rule, and to ﬁnd the derivative of a
quotient, you must use the quotient rule.1
Q: Wait a minute! The expression 2x3 is a product, and we already know that its derivative is
6x2. Where did we use the product rule?
A: To differentiate functions such as 2x3, we have used the rule from Section 10.4:
The derivative of c times a function is c times the derivative of the function.
However, the product rule gives us the same result:

We do not recommend that you use the product rule to differentiate functions like 2x3; continue
to use the simpler rule when one of the factors is a constant. ■
Derivation of the Product Rule
Before we look at more examples of using the product and quotient rules, let’s see why
the product rule is true. To calculate the derivative of the product f (x)g(x) of two dif-
ferentiable functions, we go back to the deﬁnition of the derivative:
d
dx [ f (x)g(x)] = lim
h→0
f (x + h)g(x + h) −f (x)g(x)
h
We now rewrite this expression so that we can evaluate the limit: Notice that the numer-
ator reﬂects a simultaneous change in f [from f (x) to f (x + h)] and g [from g(x) to
g(x + h)]. To separate the two effects, we add and subtract a quantity in the numerator
that reﬂects a change in only one of the functions:

Now we already know the following four limits:

h
= f ′(x)
Deﬁnition of derivative of f; f is differentiable
lim
h→0
g(x + h) −g(x)
h
= g′(x)
Deﬁnition of derivative of g; g is differentiable
lim
h→0 g(x + h) = g(x)
If g is differentiable, it must be continuous.
lim
h→0 f (x) = f (x)
Limit of a constant
Putting these limits into the one we’re calculating, we get
d
dx [ f (x)g(x)] = f ′(x)g(x) + f (x)g′(x)
which is the product rule.

Expand the 
= −4.2x3.2 + 3.2x2.2 −1

Not using the Product Rule: First, expand the given expression.
(x3.2 + 1)(1 −x) = −x4.2 + x3.2 −x + 1
Thus, 
d
dx [(x3.2 + 1)(1 −x)] = d
dx (−x4.2 + x3.2 −x + 1)
= −4.2x3.2 + 3.2x2.2 −1
In this example the product rule saves us little or no work, but in later sections
we shall see examples that can be done in no other way. Learn how to use the product
rule now!

For a proof of the fact that, if g is
differentiable, it must be
continuous, go online and follow:
Chapter 10
 Continuity and Differentiability
The quotient rule can be proved in
a very similar way. Go online and
follow:
Chapter 11
 Proof of Quotient Rule
to ﬁnd a proof.

b. Here we have a product of three functions, not just two. We can ﬁnd the derivative by
using the product rule twice:
d
dx [(x + 1)(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1)]
= d
dx (x + 1) · [(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1)] + (x + 1) · d
dx [(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1)]
= (1)(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1) + (x + 1)[(2x)(x3 + 1) + (x2 + 1)(3x2)]
= (1)(x2 + 1)(x3 + 1) + (x + 1)(2x)(x3 + 1) + (x + 1)(x2 + 1)(3x2)
We can see here a more general product rule:
( f gh)′ = f ′gh + f g′h + f gh′
Notice that every factor has a chance to contribute to the rate of change of the prod-
uct. There are similar formulas for products of four or more functions.

b. Here we have both a product and a quotient. Which rule do we use, the product or the
quotient rule? Here is a way to decide. Think about how we would calculate, step by
step, the value of (x + 1)(x + 2)/(x −1) for a speciﬁc value of x—say x = 11. Here
is how we would probably do it:
1. Calculate (x + 1)(x + 2) = (11 + 1)(11 + 2) = 156.
2. Calculate x −1 = 11 −1 = 10.
3. Divide 156 by 10 to get 15.6.
Now ask: What was the last operation we performed? The last operation we per-
formed was division, so we can regard the whole expression as a quotient—that is, as
(x + 1)(x + 2) divided by (x −1). Therefore, we should use the quotient rule. 
The ﬁrst thing the quotient rule tells us to do is take the derivative of the numerator.
Now, the numerator is a product, so we must use the product rule to take its derivative.

Here is the calculation:

What is important is to determine the order of operations and, in particular, to deter-
mine the last operation to be performed. Pretending to do an actual calculation re-
minds us of the order of operations; we call this technique the calculation thought
experiment.
Before we go on... We used the quotient rule in Example 2 because the function was a
quotient; we used the product rule to calculate the derivative of the numerator because
the numerator was a product. Get used to this: Differentiation rules usually must be used
in combination.
Here is another way we could have done this problem: Our calculation thought ex-
periment could have taken the following form:
1. Calculate (x + 1)/(x −1) = (11 + 1)/(11 −1) = 1.2.
2. Calculate x + 2 = 11 + 2 = 13.
3. Multiply 1.2 by 13 to get 15.6.
We would have then regarded the expression as a product—the product of the factors
(x + 1)/(x −1) and (x + 2)—and used the product rule instead. We can’t escape the
quotient rule however: We need to use it to take the derivative of the ﬁrst factor,
(x + 1)/(x −1). Try this approach for practice and check that you get the same answer. ■

Calculation Thought Experiment
The calculation thought experiment is a technique to determine whether to treat an
algebraic expression as a product, quotient, sum, or difference. Given an expression,
consider the steps you would use in computing its value. If the last operation is multi-
plication, treat the expression as a product; if the last operation is division, treat the
expression as a quotient; and so on.
1. (3x2 −4)(2x + 1) can be computed by ﬁrst calculating the expressions in parenthe-
ses and then multiplying. Because the last step is multiplication, we can treat the ex-
pression as a product.
2. 2x −1
x
can be computed by ﬁrst calculating the numerator and denominator and then 
dividing one by the other. Because the last step is division, we can treat the expression
as a quotient.

3. x2 + (4x −1)(x + 2) can be computed by ﬁrst calculating x2, then calculating the
product (4x −1)(x + 2), and ﬁnally adding the two answers. Thus, we can treat the
expression as a sum.
4. (3x2 −1)5 can be computed by ﬁrst calculating the expression in parentheses and
then raising the answer to the ﬁfth power. Thus, we can treat the expression as a power.
(We shall see how to differentiate powers of expressions in Section 11.2.)
It often happens that the same expression can be calculated in different ways. For
example, (x + 1)(x + 2)/(x −1) can be treated as either a quotient or a product; see
Example 2(b).

Example 4 Applying the Product and Quotient Rules: Revenue 
and Average Cost
Sales of your newly launched miniature wall posters for college dorms, iMiniPosters,
are really taking off. (Those old-fashioned large wall posters no longer ﬁt in today’s
“downsized” college dorm rooms.) Monthly sales to students at the start of this year
were 1500 iMiniPosters, and since that time, sales have been increasing by 300 posters
each month, even though the price you charge has also been going up.
a. The price you charge for iMiniPosters is given by:
p(t) = 10 + 0.05t2 dollars per poster
where t is time in months since the start of January of this year. Find a formula for the
monthly revenue, and then compute its rate of change at the beginning of March.
b. The number of students who purchase iMiniPosters in a month is given by
n(t) = 800 + 0.2t
where t is as in part (a). Find a formula for the average number of posters each stu-
dent buys, and hence estimate the rate at which this number was growing at the be-
ginning of March.
Solution
a. To compute monthly revenue as a function of time t, we use
R(t) = p(t)q(t)
Revenue = Price × Quantity
We already have a formula for p(t). The function q(t) measures sales, which were
1500 posters/month at time t = 0, and rising by 300 per month:
q(t) = 1500 + 300t
Therefore, the formula for revenue is
R(t) = p(t)q(t)
R(t) = (10 + 0.05t2)(1500 + 300t)
Rather than expand this expression, we shall leave it as a product so that we can use
the product rule in computing its rate of change:
R′(t) = p′(t)q(t) + p(t)q′(t)
= [0.10t][1500 + 300t] + [10 + 0.05t2][300]
Because the beginning of March corresponds to t = 2, we have
R′(2) = [0.10(2)][1500 + 300(2)] + [10 + 0.05(2)2][300]
= (0.2)(2100) + (10.2)(300) = $3480 per month
Therefore, your monthly revenue was increasing at a rate of $3480 per month at the
beginning of March.
b. The average number of posters sold to each student is
k(t) = Number of posters
Number of students
k(t) = q(t)
n(t) = 1500 + 300t
800 + 0.2t
11.1 The Product and Quotient Rules
805

The rate of change of k(t) is computed with the quotient rule:
k′(t) = q′(t)n(t) −q(t)n′(t)
n(t)2
= (300)(800 + 0.2t) −(1500 + 300t)(0.2)
(800 + 0.2t)2
so that
k′(2) = (300)[800 + 0.2(2)] −[1500 + 300(2)](0.2)
[800 + 0.2(2)]2
= (300)(800.4) −(2100)(0.2)
800.42
≈0.37 posters/student per month
Therefore, the average number of posters sold to each student was increasing at a rate
of about 0.37 posters/student per month.

11.2 The Chain Rule
We can now ﬁnd the derivatives of expressions involving powers of x combined using
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but we still cannot take the deriva-
tive of an expression like (3x + 1)0.5. For this we need one more rule. The function
h(x) = (3x + 1)0.5 is not a sum, difference, product, or quotient. We can use the cal-
culation thought experiment to ﬁnd the last operation we would perform in calculat-
ing h(x).
1. Calculate 3x + 1.
2. Take the 0.5 power (square root) of the answer.
Thus, the last operation is “take the 0.5 power.” We do not yet have a rule for ﬁnding the
derivative of the 0.5 power of a quantity other than x. 
There is a way to build h(x) = (3x + 1)0.5 out of two simpler functions: u(x) =
3x + 1 (the function that corresponds to the ﬁrst step in the calculation above) and
f (x) = x0.5 (the function that corresponds to the second step):
h(x) = (3x + 1)0.5
= [u(x)]0.5
u(x) = 3x + 1
= f (u(x))
f (x) = x0.5
We say that h is the composite of f and u. We read f (u(x)) as “f of u of x.”
To compute h(1), say, we ﬁrst compute 3 · 1 + 1 = 4 and then take the square root
of 4, giving h(1) = 2. To compute f (u(1)) we follow exactly the same steps: First com-
pute u(1) = 4 and then f (u(1)) = f (4) = 2. We always compute f (u(x)) numerically
from the inside out: Given x, ﬁrst compute u(x) and then f (u(x)).
Now, f and u are functions whose derivatives we know. The chain rule allows us
to use our knowledge of the derivatives of f and u to ﬁnd the derivative of f (u(x)).
For the purposes of stating the rule, let us avoid some of the nested parentheses by
abbreviating u(x) as u. Thus, we write f (u) instead of f (u(x)) and remember that u
is a function of x.
quick Examples
Chain Rule
If f is a differentiable function of u and u is a differentiable function of x, then the com-
posite f (u) is a differentiable function of x, and
d
dx [ f (u)] = f ′(u) du
dx
Chain Rule
In words The derivative of f(quantity) is the derivative of f, evaluated at that quantity,
times the derivative of the quantity.
1. Take f (u) = u2. Then
d
dx [u2] = 2u du
dx
Since f ′(u) = 2u
The derivative of a quantity squared is two times the quantity, times the derivative of
the quantity.

11.2 The Chain Rule
811
As the quick examples illustrate, for every power of a function u whose derivative
we know, we now get a “generalized” differentiation rule. The following table gives
more examples.
2. Take f (u) = u0.5. Then
d
dx [u0.5] = 0.5u−0.5 du
dx
Since f ′(u) = 0.5u−0.5.
The derivative of a quantity raised to the 0.5 is 0.5 times the quantity raised to the
−0.5, times the derivative of the quantity.

The derivative of a quantity raised to

To motivate the chain rule, let us see why it is true in the special case when
f (u) = u3, where the chain rule tells us that
d
dx [u3] = 3u2 du
dx
Generalized Power Rule with n = 3
But we could have done this using the product rule instead:
d
dx [u3] = d
dx [u · u · u] = du
dx u · u + u du
dx u + u · u du
dx = 3u2 du
dx
which gives us the same result. A similar argument works for f (u) = un where
n = 2, 3, 4, . . . We can then use the quotient rule and the chain rule for positive pow-
ers to verify the generalized power rule for negative powers as well. For the case of a
general differentiable function f, the proof of the chain rule is beyond the scope of this
book, but see the note in the margin. 
For the proof of the chain rule for a
general differentiable function f, go

Example 1 Using the Chain Rule
Compute the following derivatives.
a. d
dx [(2x2 + x)3]
b. d
dx [(x3 + x)100]
c. d
dx
√
3x + 1
Solution
a. Using the calculation thought experiment, we see that the last operation we would
perform in calculating (2x2 + x)3 is that of cubing. Thus we think of (2x2 + x)3
as a quantity cubed. There are two similar methods we can use to calculate its
derivative.
Method 1: Using the formula We think of (2x2 + x)3 as u3, where u = 2x2 + x. By
the formula,
d
dx [u3] = 3u2 du
dx
Generalized Power Rule
Now substitute for u:
d
dx [(2x2 + x)3] = 3(2x2 + x)2 d
dx (2x2 + x)
= 3(2x2 + x)2(4x + 1)
Method 2: Using the verbal form If we prefer to use the verbal form, we get:
The derivative of (2x2 + x) cubed is three times (2x2 + x) squared, times the
derivative of (2x2 + x).
In symbols,
d
dx [(2x2 + x)3] = 3(2x2 + x)2(4x + 1)
as we obtained above. 
b. First, the calculation thought experiment: If we were computing (x3 + x)100, the last
operation we would perform is raising a quantity to the power 100. Thus we are
dealing with a quantity raised to the power 100, and so we must again use the gen-
eralized power rule. According to the verbal form of the generalized power rule, the
derivative of a quantity raised to the power 100 is 100 times that quantity to the
power 99, times the derivative of that quantity. In symbols,
d
dx [(x3 + x)100] = 100(x3 + x)99(3x2 + 1)
c. We ﬁrst rewrite the expression √3x + 1 as (3x + 1)0.5 and then use the generalized
power rule as in parts (a) and (b):
The derivative of a quantity raised to the 0.5 is 0.5 times the quantity raised to the
−0.5, times the derivative of the quantity.
Thus,
d
dx [(3x + 1)0.5] = 0.5(3x + 1)−0.5 · 3 = 1.5(3x + 1)−0.5

11.2 The Chain Rule
813
Q: It seems that there are now two formulas for the derivative of an nth power:
(1)
d
dx [xn] = nxn−1
(2)
d
dx [un] = nun−1 du
dx
Which one do I use?
A: Formula 1 is the original power rule, which applies only to a power of x. For instance, it
applies to x10, but it does not apply to (2x + 1)10 because the quantity that is being raised to
a power is not x. Formula 2 applies to a power of any function of x, such as (2x + 1)10. It can
even be used in place of the original power rule. For example, if we take u = x in Formula 2, we
obtain
d
dx [xn] = nxn−1 dx
dx
= nxn−1
The derivative of x with respect to x is 1.
Thus, the generalized power rule really is a generalization of the original power rule, as its name
suggests. ■
+Before we go on... The following are examples of common errors in solving Exam-
ple 1(b):
“ d
dx [(x3 + x)100] = 100(3x2 + 1)99 ”
✗
WRONG!
“ d
dx [(x3 + x)100] = 100(x3 + x)99 ”
✗
WRONG!
Remember that the generalized power rule says that the derivative of a quantity to the
power 100 is 100 times that same quantity raised to the power 99, times the derivative of
that quantity. ■

Example 3 Harder Examples Using the Chain Rule
Find dy
dx in each case. a. y = [(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x]−3
b. y = (x + 10)3√
1 −x2
Solution
a. The calculation thought experiment tells us that the last operation we would perform
in calculating y is raising the quantity [(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x] to the power −3. Thus, we
use the generalized power rule.
dy
dx = −3[(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x]−4 d
dx [(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x]
We are not yet done; we must still ﬁnd the derivative of (x + 1)−2.5 + 3x. Finding the
derivative of a complicated function in several steps helps to keep the problem man-
ageable. Continuing, we have
dy
dx = −3[(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x]−4 d
dx [(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x]
= −3[(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x]−4

Derivative of a sum
Now we have two derivatives left to calculate. The second of these we know to be 3,
and the ﬁrst is the derivative of a quantity raised to the −2.5 power. Thus
dy
dx = −3[(x + 1)−2.5 + 3x]−4[−2.5(x + 1)−3.5 · 1 + 3]
b. The expression (x + 10)3√
1 −x2 is a product, so we use the product rule:

Applications
The next example is a new treatment of Example 3 from Section 10.8.
+Before we go on... In Example 2(c), we could have used the quotient rule instead of the
generalized power rule. We can think of the quantity 1/(x2 + x) in two different ways
using the calculation thought experiment:
1. As 1 divided by something—in other words, as a quotient
2. As something raised to the −1 power
Of course, we get the same derivative using either approach. ■

11.2 The Chain Rule

Example 4 Marginal Product
Precision Manufacturers is informed by a consultant that its annual proﬁt is given by
P = −200,000 + 4000q −0.46q2 −0.00001q3
where q is the number of surgical lasers it sells each year. The consultant also informs
Precision that the number of surgical lasers it can manufacture each year depends on the
number n of assembly line workers it employs according to the equation
q = 100n
Each worker contributes 100 lasers per year
Use the chain rule to ﬁnd the marginal product d P
dn .
Solution
We could calculate the marginal product by substituting the expression for q in the ex-
pression for P to obtain P as a function of n (as given in Chapter 10) and then ﬁnding
dP/dn. Alternatively—and this will simplify the calculation—we can use the chain rule.
To see how the chain rule applies, notice that P is a function of q, where q in turn is given
as a function of n. By the chain rule,
d P
dn = P′(q) dq
dn
Chain Rule
= d P
dq
dq
dn
Notice how the ‘‘quantities’’ dq appear to cancel
Now we compute
d P
dq = 4000 −0.92q −0.00003q2
and
dq
dn = 100
Substituting into the equation for d P
dn gives
d P
dn = (4000 −0.92q −0.00003q2)(100)
= 400,000 −92q −0.003q2
Notice that the answer has q as a variable. We can express d P/dn as a function of
n by substituting 100n for q:
d P
dn = 400,000 −92(100n) −0.003(100n)2
= 400,000 −9200n −30n2
The equation
d P
dn = d P
dq
dq
dn
in the example above is an appealing way of writing the chain rule because it suggests
that the “quantities” dq cancel. In general, we can write the chain rule as follows.

Example 5 Marginal Revenue
Suppose a company’s weekly revenue R is given as a function of the unit price p, and p
in turn is given as a function of weekly sales q (by means of a demand equation). If
d R
dp

q=1000
= $40 per $1increase in price
and
dp
dq

q=1000
= −$20 per additional item sold per week
ﬁnd the marginal revenue when sales are 1000 items per week.
Solution
The marginal revenue is d R
dq . By the chain rule, we have
d R
dq = d R
dp
dp
dq
Units: Revenue per item = 
Revenue per $1 price increase × price increase per additional item
Because we are interested in the marginal revenue at a demand level of 1000 items per
week, we have
d R
dq

q=1000
= (40)(−20) = −$800 per additional item sold
Thus, if the price is lowered to increase the demand from 1000 to 1001 items per week,
the weekly revenue will drop by approximately $800.
Look again at the way the terms “du” appeared to cancel in the differential formula
dy
dx = dy
du

dx . In fact, the chain rule tells us more:
quick Example
Chain Rule in Differential Notation
If y is a differentiable function of u, and u is a differentiable function of x, then
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx
Notice how the units cancel:
Units of y
Units of x = Units of y
Units of u
Units of u
Units of x
If y = u3, where u = 4x + 1, then
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx = 3u2 · 4 = 12u2 = 12(4x + 1)2
You can see one of the reasons we still use Leibniz differential notation: The chain
rule looks like a simple “cancellation” of du terms.

FAQs
Using the Chain Rule
Q: How do I decide whether or not to use the chain rule when taking a derivative?
A: Use the Calculation Thought Experiment (Section 11.1): Given an expression, consider the
steps you would use in computing its value.

when we can solve for x)* one has

2. Suppose x and y are functions of t. Then, thinking of y as a function of x (as, for
instance, when we can solve for t as a function of x, and hence obtain y as a function
of x) one has
dy
dx = dy/dt
dx/dt
The terms dt appear to cancel.
If x = 3 −0.2t and y = 6 + 6t, then
dy
dx = dy/dt
dx/dt =
6
−0.2 = −30
* The notion of “thinking of x as a function of y” will be made more precise in Section 11.4.
To see why the above formulas work, notice that the second formula,

appropriate. ■
Q: Every time I compute the derivative, I leave something out. How do I make sure I am really
done when taking the derivative of a complicated-looking expression?
A: Until you are an expert at taking derivatives, the key is to use one rule at a time and write
out each step, rather than trying to compute the derivative in a single step. To illustrate this, try
computing the derivative of (x + 10)3
1 −x2 in Example 3(b) in two ways: First try to compute
it in a single step, and then compute it by writing out each step as shown in the example. How do
your results compare? For more practice, try Exercises 83 and 84 below. ■

Exponential Functions
At this point, we know how to take the derivative of any algebraic expression in x (in-
volving powers, radicals, and so on). We now turn to the derivatives of logarithmic and
exponential functions.

As h →0+, the quantity x/h is getting large and positive, and so the quantity in
brackets is approaching e (see the deﬁnition of e in Section 9.2), which leaves us with
ln[e]1/x = 1
x ln e = 1
x
which is the derivative we are after.19 What about the limit as h →0−? We will glide
over that case and leave it for the interested reader to pursue.20
The rule for the derivative of logb x follows from the fact that logb x = ln x/ ln b.
If we were to take the derivative of the natural logarithm of a quantity (a function
of x), rather than just x, we would need to use the chain rule:
Algebra
Properties of the logarithm
19 We actually used the fact that the logarithm function is continuous when we took the limit.
20 Here is an outline of the argument for negative h. Since x must be positive for ln x to be deﬁned, we ﬁnd that
x/h →−∞as h →0−, and so we must consider the quantity (1 + 1/m)m for large negative m. It turns out
the limit is still e (check it numerically!) and so the computation above still works.
* If we were to evaluate ln(x2 + 1), the last operation we would perform would be to take the natural logarithm
of a quantity. Thus, the calculation thought experiment tells us that we are dealing with ln of a quantity, and so
we need the generalized logarithm rule as stated above.

Example 3 Logarithm of an Absolute Value
Find d
dx [ln |x|].
Solution Before we start, we note that ln x is deﬁned only for positive values of x,
so its domain is the set of positive real numbers. The domain of ln |x|, on the other
hand, is the set of all nonzero real numbers. For example, ln | −2| = ln 2 ≈0.6931.
For this reason, ln |x| often turns out to be more useful than the ordinary logarithm
function.
Now we’ll get to work. The calculation thought experiment tells us that ln |x| is the
natural logarithm of a quantity, so we use the chain rule:
d
dx [ln |x|] = 1

In other words, when taking the derivative of the logarithm of the absolute value of
a quantity, we can simply ignore the absolute value!
We now turn to the derivatives of exponential functions—that is, functions of the
form f (x) = bx. We begin by showing how not to differentiate them.

Derivative of bx
If b is any positive number, then
d
dx [bx] = bx ln b
Note that if b = e, we obtain the previous formula,
d
dx [3x] = 3x ln 3
Derivation of the Formula 
[ex] = ex
To ﬁnd the derivative of ex we use a shortcut.22 Write g(x) = ex. Then
ln g(x) = x
Take the derivative of both sides of this equation to get
g′(x)
g(x) = 1
or
g′(x) = g(x) = ex
In other words, the exponential function with base e is its own derivative. The rule for
exponential functions with other bases follows from the equality bx = ex ln b (why?) and
the chain rule. (Try it.)
d

If we were to take the derivative of e raised to a quantity, not just x, we would need
to use the chain rule, as follows.

22 This shortcut is an example of a technique called logarithmic differentiation, which is occasionally useful.
We will see it again in the next section.
* The calculation thought experiment tells us that we have e raised to a quantity.
Thus, ex has the amazing property that its derivative is itself!21 For bases other
than e, we have the following generalization:

then the rate of change of the account balance after t years is
d
dt [1000e0.05t] = 1000(0.05)e0.05t = 50e0.05t dollars/year
Example 4 Epidemics
In the early stages of the AIDS epidemic during the 1980s, the number of cases in the
U.S. was increasing by about 50% every 6 months. By the start of 1983, there were ap-
proximately 1600 AIDS cases in the United States.* Had this trend continued, how many
new cases per year would have been occurring by the start of 1993?
Solution To ﬁnd the answer, we must ﬁrst model this exponential growth using the
methods of Chapter 9. Referring to Example 3 in Section 9.2, we ﬁnd that t years after
the start of 1983 the number of cases is
A = 1600(2.25t)
We are asking for the number of new cases each year. In other words, we want the rate
of change, dA/dt:
d A
dt = 1600(2.25)t ln 2.25 cases per year
At the start of 1993, t = 10, so the number of new cases per year is
d A
dt

t=10
= 1600(2.25)10 ln 2.25 ≈4,300,000 cases per year

HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, 2000;12 (No. 2).
+Before we go on... In Example 4, the ﬁgure for the number of new cases per year is
so large because we assumed that exponential growth—the 50% increase every six
months—would continue. A more realistic model for the spread of a disease is the
logistic model. (See Section 9.4, as well as the next example.) ■

where q(t) is the total number of units sold t months after its introduction. How fast is
the game selling two years after its introduction?
Solution We are asked for q′(24). We can ﬁnd the derivative of q(t) using the quotient
rule, or we can ﬁrst write
q(t) = 10,000(1 + 0.5e−0.4t)−1
and then use the generalized power rule:
q′(t) = −10,000(1 + 0.5e−0.4t)−2(0.5e−0.4t)(−0.4)
=
2000e−0.4t
(1 + 0.5e−0.4t)2
Thus,
q′(24) =
2000e−0.4(24)
(1 + 0.5e−0.4(24))2 ≈0.135 units per month
So, after 2 years, sales are quite slow.
+Before we go on... We can check the answer in Example 5 graphically. If we plot the
total sales curve for 0 ≤t ≤30 and 6000 ≤q ≤10,000, on a TI-83/84, for example, we
get the graph shown in Figure 2. Notice that total sales level off at about 10,000 units.23
We computed q′(24), which is the slope of the curve at the point with t-coordinate 24. If
we zoom in to the portion of the curve near t = 24, we obtain the graph shown in Fig-
ure 3, with 23 ≤t ≤25 and 9999 ≤q ≤10,000. The curve is almost linear in this
range. If we use the two endpoints of this segment of the curve, (23, 9999.4948) and (25,
9999.7730), we can approximate the derivative as
9999.7730 −9999.4948
25 −23
= 0.1391
which is accurate to two decimal places. ■
23 We can also say this using limits: limt→+∞q(t) = 10,000.

Implicit Differentiation (OPTIONAL)
Consider the equation y5 + y + x = 0, whose graph is shown in Figure 4. 
How did we obtain this graph? We did not solve for y as a function of x; that is im-
possible. In fact, we solved for x in terms of y to ﬁnd points to plot. Nonetheless, the
graph in Figure 4 is the graph of a function because it passes the vertical line test: Every
vertical line crosses the graph no more than once, so for each value of x there is no more
than one corresponding value of y. Because we cannot solve for y explicitly in terms of
x, we say that the equation y5 + y + x = 0 determines y as an implicit function of x.
Now, suppose we want to ﬁnd the slope of the tangent line to this curve at, say, the
point (2, −1) (which, you should check, is a point on the curve). In the following ex-
ample we ﬁnd, surprisingly, that it is possible to obtain a formula for dy/dx without
having to ﬁrst solve the equation for y.
Example 1 Implicit Differentiation 
Find dy
dx , given that y5 + y + x = 0
Solution
We use the chain rule and a little cleverness. Think of y as a function of x and take the
derivative with respect to x of both sides of the equation:
y5 + y + x = 0
Original equation
d
dx [y5 + y + x] = d
dx [0]
Derivative with respect to x of both sides
d
dx [y5] + d
dx [y] + d
dx [x] = 0
Derivative rules
Now we must be careful. The derivative with respect to x of y5 is not 5y4. Rather, be-
cause y is a function of x, we must use the chain rule, which tells us that
d
dx [y5] = 5y4 dy
dx
Figure 4
y
x
2
2
5
5

Thus, we get
5y4 dy
dx + dy
dx + 1 = 0
We want to ﬁnd dy/dx, so we solve for it:
(5y4 + 1) dy
dx = −1
Isolate dy/dx on one side.
dy
dx = −
1
5y4 + 1
Divide both sides by 5y4 + 1.
Before we go on... Note that we should not expect to obtain dy/dx as an explicit func-
tion of x if y was not an explicit function of x to begin with. For example, the formula we
found in Example 1 for dy/dx is not a function of x because there is a y in it. However,
the result is still useful because we can evaluate the derivative at any point on the graph.
For instance, at the point (2, −1) on the graph, we get
dy
dx = −
1
5y4 + 1 = −
1
5 (−1)4 + 1 = −1
6
Thus, the slope of the tangent line to the curve y5 + y + x = 0 at the point (2, −1) is
−1/6. Figure 5 shows the graph and this tangent line. ■
This procedure we just used—differentiating an equation to ﬁnd dy/dx without
ﬁrst solving the equation for y—is called implicit differentiation.
In Example 1 we were given an equation in x and y that determined y as an (im-
plicit) function of x, even though we could not solve for y. But an equation in x and y
need not always determine y, as a function of x. Consider, for example, the equation
2x2 + y2 = 2
Solving for y yields y = ±
√
2 −2x2. The ± sign reminds us that for some values of x
there are two corresponding values for y. We can graph this equation by superimposing
the graphs of
y =

2 −2x2
and y = −

2 −2x2
The graph, an ellipse, is shown in Figure 6.
The graph of y =
√
2 −2x2 constitutes the top half of the ellipse, and the graph of
y = −
√
2 −2x2 constitutes the bottom half. 
Example 2 Slope of Tangent Line
Refer to Figure 6. Find she slope of the tangent line to the ellipse 2x2 + y2 = 2 at the
point (1/
√
2, 1). 
Solution Because (1/
√
2, 1) is on the top half of the ellipse in Figure 6, we could dif-
ferentiate the function y =
√
2 −2x2, to obtain the result, but it is actually easier to
apply implicit differentiation to the original equation.
2x2 + y2 = 2

The derivative gives the slope of the tangent line, so we want to evaluate the deriv-
ative at the point where y = 1. However, the formula for dy/dx requires values for both
x and y. We get the value of x by substituting y = 1 in the original equation:
lny = xy
ln(1) = x · 1
But ln(1) = 0, and so x = 0 for this point. Thus,

Therefore, the tangent line is the line through (x, y) = (0, 1) with slope 1, which is

Techniques of Differentiation

Before we go on... Example 3 presents an instance of an implicit function in which it
is simply not possible to solve for y. Try it. ■
Sometimes, it is easiest to differentiate a complicated function of x by ﬁrst taking
the logarithm and then using implicit differentiation—a technique called logarithmic
differentiation.
Example 4 Logarithmic Differentiation
Find d
dx
(x + 1)10(x2 + 1)11
(x3 + 1)12

without using the product or quotient rules.
Solution Write
y = (x + 1)10(x2 + 1)11
(x3 + 1)12
and then take the natural logarithm of both sides:
ln y = ln
(x + 1)10(x2 + 1)11
(x3 + 1)12

We can use properties of the logarithm to simplify the right-hand side:
ln y = ln(x + 1)10 + ln(x2 + 1)11 −ln(x3 + 1)12
= 10 ln(x + 1) + 11 ln(x2 + 1) −12 ln(x3 + 1)

Application
Productivity usually depends on both labor and capital. Suppose, for example, you are
managing a surfboard manufacturing company. You can measure its productivity by
counting the number of surfboards the company makes each year. As a measure of labor,
you can use the number of employees, and as a measure of capital you can use its oper-
ating budget. The so-called Cobb-Douglas model uses a function of the form:
P = K xay1−a
Cobb-Douglas model for productivity
11.4 Implicit Differentiation (OPTIONAL)

+
+

where P stands for the number of surfboards made each year, x is the number of em-
ployees, and y is the operating budget. The numbers K and a are constants that depend
on the particular situation studied, with a between 0 and 1.
Example 5 Cobb-Douglas Production Function 
The surfboard company you own has the Cobb-Douglas production function 
P = x0.3y0.7
where P is the number of surfboards it produces per year, x is the number of employees,
and y is the daily operating budget (in dollars). Assume that the production level P is
constant.
a. Find dy
dx .
b. Evaluate this derivative at x = 30 and y = 10,000, and interpret the answer.
Solution
a. We are given the equation P = x0.3y0.7, in which P is constant. We ﬁnd dy
dx by
implicit differentiation
0 = d

To interpret this result, ﬁrst look at the units of the derivative: We recall that the units
of dy/dx are units of y per unit of x. Because y is the daily budget, its units are dol-
lars; because x is the number of employees, its units are employees. Thus,
dy
dx

x=30, y=10,000
≈−$143 per employee
Next, recall that dy/dx measures the rate of change of y as x changes. Because the an-
swer is negative, the daily budget to maintain production at the ﬁxed level is decreas-
ing by approximately $143 per additional employee at an employment level of 30 em-
ployees and a daily operating budget of $10,000. In other words, increasing the
workforce by one worker will result in a savings of approximately $143 per day.
Roughly speaking, a new employee is worth $143 per day at the current levels of em-
ployment and production.

the Rings is related to the demand q in weekly sales by the
equation
100pq + q2 = 5,000,000
Suppose the price is set at $40, which would make the de-
mand 1000 copies per week.

Although you are tempted to support TJM’s proposal at the next board meeting, you
would like to estimate ﬁrst whether the 20,000 ﬁgure is a realistic expectation, espe-
cially because the graph suggests that the number of graduates began to “level off” (in
the language of calculus, the derivative appears to be decreasing) during the second half
of the period. Moreover, you recall reading somewhere that the numbers of students in
the lower grades have also begun to level off, so it is safe to predict that the slowing of
growth in the senior class will continue over the next few years. You really need precise
data about numbers in the lower grades in order to make a meaningful prediction, but
TJM’s report is scheduled to be presented tomorrow and you would like a quick and easy
way of “extending the curve to the right” by then.
It would certainly be helpful if you had a mathematical model of the data in Figure 7
that you could use to project the current trend. But what kind of model should you use?
A linear model would be no good because it would not show any change in the deriva-
tive (the derivative of a linear function is constant). In addition, best-ﬁt polynomial and
exponential functions do not accurately reﬂect the leveling off, as you realize after try-
ing to ﬁt a few of them (Figure 8).
You then recall that a logistic curve can model the leveling-off property you desire,
and so you try ﬁtting a curve of the form
y =
N

Projecting Market Growth
You are on the board of directors at Fullcourt Acade-
mic Press, and TJM, the sales director of the high
school division, has just burst into your ofﬁce with
data showing the number of high school graduates
each year over the past decade (Figure 7).41
TJM is pleased that the ﬁgures appear to support
a basic premise of his recent proposal for a major ex-
pansion strategy: The number of high school seniors
in the U.S. will be growing at a rate of at least 20,000
per year through the year 2005. The rate of increase, as
he points out, has averaged around 50,000 per year since 1994, so it would not be overly
optimistic to assume that the trend will continue—at least for the next 5 years.

The leveling-off prediction certainly seems reasonable, but you are slightly troubled by
the shape of the regression curve: It doesn’t seem to “follow the s-shape” of the data
very convincingly. Moreover, the curve doesn’t appear to ﬁt the data signiﬁcantly more
snugly than the quadratic or cubic models.42 To reassure yourself, you decide to look for
another kind of s-shaped model as a backup.
After ﬂipping through a calculus book, you stumble across a function whose graph
looks rather like the one you have (Figure 10).
42 There is another, more mathematical, reason for not using logistic regression to predict long-term leveling
off: The regression value of the long-term level N is extremely sensitive to the values of the other coefﬁcients.
As a result, there can be good ﬁts to the same set of data with a wide variety of values of N.
y =
t
1 + |t|

Curves of this form are sometimes called predator satiation curves, and they are used to
model the population of predators in an environment with limited prey. Although the
curve does seem to have the proper shape, you realize that you will need to shift and
scale the function in order to ﬁt the actual data. The most general scaled and shifted ver-
sion of this curve has the form
y = c + b
a (t −m)
1 + a |t −m|
(a, b, c, m constant)
and you decide to try a model of this form, where y will represent the number of high
school seniors (in millions), and t will represent years since 1994.
For the moment, you postpone the question of ﬁnding the best values for the con-
stants a, b, c, and m, and decide ﬁrst to calculate the derivative of the model in terms of
the given constants. The derivative, dy/dt, will represent the rate of increase of high
school graduates, which is exactly what you wish to estimate.
The main part of the function is a quotient, so you start with the quotient rule:
dy
dt = b
a(1 + a|t −m|) −a(t −m) d
dt (1 + a|t −m|)
(1 + a|t −m|)2
You now recall the formula for the derivative of an absolute value:
d
dt [|t|] = |t|
t =
 1
if t > 0
−1
if t ≤0
which, you are disturbed to notice, is not deﬁned at t = 0. Undaunted, you make a men-
tal note and press on. Because you need the derivative of the absolute value of a quan-
tity other than t, you use the chain rule, which tells you that
d
dt [|u|] = |u|
u
du
dt
Thus,
d
dt [|t −m|] = |t −m|
t −m · 1
u = t −m;
m = constant
(This is not deﬁned when t = m.) Substituting into the formula for dy/dt, you ﬁnd:
dy
dt = b
a(1 + a|t −m|) −a(t −m) · a |t −m|
(t −m)
(1 + a|t −m|)2
= ba(1 + a|t −m|) −a2|t −m|
(1 + a|t −m|)2
=
ab
(1 + a|t −m|)2
It is interesting that, although the derivative of |t −m| is not deﬁned when t = m, the
offending term t −m was canceled, so that dy/dt seems to be deﬁned43 at t = m.
Now you have a simple-looking expression for dy/dt, which will give you an esti-
mate of the rate of change of the high school senior population. However, you still need
Cancel (t −m)

the derivative—where has it gone?—but it is a part of the model.) How do you ﬁnd the
values of a, b, c, and m that result in the curve that best ﬁts the given data?

and then copied into the cells below it. Since the square error (Residue^2) is deﬁned as
the square of the difference between y and y (Predicted), we enter
=(C2-B2)^2
in cell D2 and then copy into the cells below it. The sum-of-squares error, SSE (sum of
the entries in D2–D11), is then placed in cell F7.
The values of a, b, c, and m shown are initial values and don’t matter too much (but
see below); you will have Excel change these values in order to improve your model.
The smaller the SSE is, the better your model. (For a perfect ﬁt, the y(Observed)col-
umn would equal the y(Observed) column, and SSE would be zero.) Hence, the goal
is now to ﬁnd values of a, b, c, and m that make the value of SSE as small as possible.
(See the discussion in Section 1.4.) Finding these values analytically is an extremely

difﬁcult mathematical problem. However, there is software, such as Excel’s built-in
“Solver” routine,44 that can be used to ﬁnd numerical solutions.
Figure 11 shows how to set up Solver to ﬁnd the best values for a, b, c, and m for
the setup used in this spreadsheet.

The Target Cell, $F$7, contains the value of SSE, which is to be minimized. The
Changing Cells are the cells containing the values of the constants a, b, c, and m that we
want to change. That’s it.
Now press “Solve.” After thinking about it for a few seconds, Excel gives the opti-
mal values of a, b, c, and m in cells F2–F5, and the minimum value of SSE in cell D12.45
You ﬁnd
a = 0.24250175, b = 0.4102711, c = 2.65447873, m = 3.5211956
with SSE ≈0.00288, which is a better ﬁt than the logistic regression curve
(SSE ≈0.00653)
Figure 12 shows that not only does this choice of model and constants give an ex-
cellent ﬁt, but that the curve seems to follow the “s-shape” more convincingly than the
logistic curve.
44 See the similar discussion in Section 9.4. If “Solver” does not appear in the “Tools” menu, you should ﬁrst
install it using your Excel installation software. (Solver is one of the “Excel Add-Ins.”)
45 Depending on the settings in Solver, you may need to run the utility twice in succession to reach the mini-
mum value of SSE.

or 12,600 students per year—far less than the optimistic estimate of 20,000 in the
proposal!
You now conclude that TJM’s prediction is suspect and that further research will
have to be done before the board can support the proposal.
Q: How accurately does the model predict the number of high school graduates?
A: Using a regression curve-fitting model to make long-term predictions is always risky. A
more accurate model would have to take into account such factors as the birth rate and current
school populations at all levels. The U.S. Department of Education has used more sophisticated
models to make the projections shown below, which we compare with those predicted by our
model.

Q: Which values of the constants should I use as starting values when using Excel to find the
best-fit curve?
A: If the starting values of the constants are far from the optimal values, Solver may find a
nonoptimal solution. Thus, you need to obtain some rough initial estimate of the constants by
examining the graph. Figure 14 shows some important features of the curve that you can use to
obtain estimates of a, b, c, and m by inspecting the graph.

From the graph, m and c are the coordinates of the point on the curve where it is steepest,
and b is the vertical distance from that point to the upper or lower asymptote (where the curve
“levels off”). To estimate a, first estimate the slope of the tangent at the point of steepest incli-
nation, then divide by b. If b is negative (and a is positive), we obtain an “upside-down” version
of the curve (Figure 15).

Introduction
In this chapter we begin to see the power of calculus as an optimization tool. In
Chapter 9 we saw how to price an item in order to get the largest revenue when the
demand function is linear. Using calculus, we can handle nonlinear functions, which
are much more general. In Section 12.1 we show how calculus can be used to solve
the problem of ﬁnding the values of a variable that lead to a maximum or minimum
value of a given function. In Section 12.2 we show how this helps us in various real-
world applications.
Another theme in this chapter is that calculus can help us to draw and understand
the graph of a function. By the time you have completed the material in Section 12.1,
you will be able to locate and sketch some of the important features of a graph. In Sec-
tion 12.3 we discuss further how to explain what you see in a graph (drawn, for exam-
ple, using graphing technology) and to locate its most important points.
We also include sections on related rates and elasticity of demand. The ﬁrst of these
(Section 12.4) examines further the concept of the derivative as a rate of change. The
second (Section 12.5) returns to the problem of optimizing revenue based on the de-
mand equation, looking at it in a new way that leads to an important idea in
economics—elasticity.
algebra Review
For this chapter, you should 
be familiar with the algebra 
reviewed in Chapter 0, 
sections 5 and 6.
Figure 1
12.1 Maxima and Minima
Figure 1 shows the graph of a function f whose domain is the closed interval [a, b]. A
mathematician sees lots of interesting things going on here. There are hills and valleys,
and even a small chasm (called a cusp) toward the right. For many purposes, the impor-
tant features of this curve are the highs and lows. Suppose, for example, you know that
the price of the stock of a certain company will follow this graph during the course of a
week. Although you would certainly make a handsome proﬁt if you bought at time a and
sold at time b, your best strategy would be to follow the old adage to “buy low and sell
high,” buying at all the lows and selling at all the highs.
Figure 2 shows the graph once again with the highs and lows marked. Mathemati-
cians have names for these points: the highs (at the x-values c, e, and b) are referred to
as relative maxima, and the lows (at the x-values a, d, and k) are referred to as relative
minima. Collectively, these highs and lows are referred to as relative extrema. (A point
of language: The singular forms of the plurals minima, maxima, and extrema are mini-
mum, maximum, and extremum.)
Why do we refer to these points as relative extrema? Take a look at the point corre-
sponding to x = c. It is the highest point of the graph compared to other points nearby.
If you were an extremely nearsighted mountaineer standing at point c, you would think
that you were at the highest point of the graph, not being able to see the distant peaks at
x = e and x = b.
Let’s translate into mathematical terms. We are talking about the heights of various
points on the curve. The height of the curve at x = c is f (c), so we are saying that f (c)
is greater than f (x) for every x near c. For instance, f (c) is the greatest value that f (x)
has for all choices of x between a and d (see Figure 3).

We can phrase the formal deﬁnition as follows.

quick Examples
Relative Extrema
f has a relative maximum at c if there is some interval (r, s) (even a very small one)
containing c for which f (c) ≥f (x) for all x between r and s for which f (x) is deﬁned.
f has a relative minimum at c if there is some interval (r, s) (even a very small one) con-
taining c for which f (c) ≤f (x) for all x between r and s for which f (x) is deﬁned.
In Figure 2, f has the following relative extrema:
1. A relative maximum at c, as shown by the interval (a, d)
2. A relative maximum at e, as shown by the interval (d, k)
3. A relative maximum at b, as shown by the interval (k, b + 1)
Note that f (x) is not deﬁned for x > b. However, f (b) ≥f (x) for every x in the in-
terval (k, b + 1) for which f (x) is deﬁned—that is, for every x in (k, b].
4. A relative minimum at d, as shown by the interval (c, e)
5. A relative minimum at k, as shown by the interval (e, b)
6. A relative minimum at a, as shown by the interval (a −1, c) (See Quick Example 3)
quick Examples
Absolute Extrema
f has an absolute maximum at c if f (c) ≥f (x) for every x in the domain of f.
f has an absolute minimum at c if f (c) ≤f (x) for every x in the domain of f. 
1. In Figure 2, f has an absolute maximum at b and an absolute minimum at d.
2. If f (x) = x2 then f (x) ≥f (0) for every real number x. Therefore, f (x) = x2 has an
absolute minimum at x = 0 (see the ﬁgure).
3. Generalizing (2), every quadratic function f (x) = ax2 + bx + c has an absolute ex-
tremum at its vertex x = −b/(2a); it is an absolute minimum if a > 0 and an absolute
maximum if a < 0.
x
y
y = x2
Absolute minimum at x = 0
Note Our deﬁnition of relative extremum allows f to have a relative extremum at an
endpoint of its domain; the deﬁnitions used in some books do not. In view of examples
like our stock-market investing strategy, we ﬁnd it very useful to count endpoints as
extrema. ■
Looking carefully at Figure 2, we can see that the lowest point on the whole graph
is where x = d and the highest point is where x = b. This means that f (d) is the small-
est value of f on the whole domain of f (the interval [a, b]) and f (b) is the largest value.
We call these the absolute minimum and maximum.
Some graphs have no absolute extrema at all (think of the graph of y = x), while
others might have an absolute minimum but no absolute maximum (like y = x2), or
vice versa. When f does have an absolute maximum, there is only one absolute maxi-
mum value of f, but this value may occur at different values of x. (see Figure 4).

Q: At how many different values of x can f take on its absolute maximum value?
A: An extreme case is that of a constant function; because we use ≥in the definition of 
absolute maximum, a constant function has an absolute maximum (and minimum) at every
point in its domain. ■
Now, how do we go about locating extrema? In many cases we can get a good idea
by using graphing technology to zoom in on a maximum or minimum and approximate
its coordinates. However, calculus gives us a way to ﬁnd the exact locations of the ex-
trema and at the same time to understand why the graph of a function behaves the way
it does. In fact, it is often best to combine the powers of graphing technology with those
of calculus, as we shall see.
In Figure 5 we see the graph from Figure 1 once more, but we have labeled each
extreme point as one of three types.

At the points labeled “stationary,” the tangent lines to the graph are horizontal, and
so have slope 0, so f ′ (which gives the slope) is 0. Any time f ′(x) = 0, we say that f has
a stationary point at x because the rate of change of f is zero there. We call an ex-
tremum that occurs at a stationary point a stationary extremum. In general, to ﬁnd the
exact location of each stationary point, we need to solve the equation f ′(x) = 0.
There is a relative minimum in Figure 5 at x = k, but there is no horizontal tangent
there. In fact, there is no tangent line at all; f ′(k) is not deﬁned. (Recall a similar situa-
tion with the graph of f (x) = |x| at x = 0.) When f ′(x) does not exist, we say that f
has a singular point at x. We shall call an extremum that occurs at a singular point a sin-
gular extremum. The points that are either stationary or singular we call collectively the
critical points of f.
The remaining two extrema are at the endpoints of the domain.1 As we see in the
ﬁgure, they are (almost) always either relative maxima or relative minima.
Q: Are there any other types of relative extrema?
A: No; relative extrema of a function always occur at critical points or endpoints (a rigorous
proof is beyond the scope of this book).2 ■
1 Remember that we do allow relative extrema at endpoints.
2 Here is an outline of the argument. Suppose f has a relative maximum, say, at x = a, at a point other than an
endpoint of the domain. Then either f is differentiable there, or it is not. If it is not, then we have a singular
point. If f is differentiable at x = a, then consider the slope of the secant line through the points where x = a
and x = a + h for small positive h. Since f has a relative maximum at x = a, it is falling (or level) to the right
of x = a, and so the slope of this secant line must be ≤0. Thus we must have f ′(a) ≤0 in the limit as h →0.
On the other hand, if h is small and negative, then the corresponding secant line must have slope ≥0 because
f is also falling (or level) as we move left from x = a, and so f ′(a) ≥0. Since f ′(a) is both ≥0 and ≤0, it
must be zero, and so we have a stationary point at x = a.

Remember, though, that these are only candidates for relative extrema. It is quite
possible, as we shall see, to have a stationary point (or singular point) that is neither a
relative maximum nor a relative minimum.
Now let’s look at some examples of ﬁnding maxima and minima. In all of these ex-
amples, we will use the following procedure: First, we ﬁnd the derivative, which we ex-
amine to ﬁnd the stationary points and singular points. Next, we make a table listing the
x-coordinates of the critical points and endpoints, together with their y-coordinates. We
use this table to make a rough sketch of the graph. From the table and rough sketch, we usu-
ally have enough data to be able to say where the extreme points are and what kind they are.
12.1 Maxima and Minima
855
quick Examples
Locating Candidates for Relative Extrema
If f is a real valued function, then its relative extrema occur among the following types
of points:
1. Stationary Points: f has a stationary point at x if x is in the domain and f ′(x) = 0.
To locate stationary points, set f ′(x) = 0 and solve for x.
2. Singular Points: f has a singular point at x if x is in the domain and f ′(x) is not
deﬁned. To locate singular points, ﬁnd values of x where f ′(x) is not deﬁned, but
f (x) is deﬁned.
3. Endpoints: The x-coordinates of endpoints are endpoints of the domain, if any.
Recall that closed intervals contain endpoints, but open intervals do not.
Once we have the x-coordinates of a candidate for a relative extremum, we ﬁnd the cor-
responding y-coordinate using y = f (x).
1. Stationary Points: Let f (x) = x3 −12x. Then to locate the stationary points, set
f ′(x) = 0 and solve for x. This gives 3x2 −12 = 0, so f has stationary points at
x = ±2. Thus, the stationary points are (−2, f (−2)) = (−2, 16) and (2, f (2)) =
(2, −16).
2. Singular points: Let f (x) = 3(x −1)1/3. Then f ′(x) = (x −1)−2/3 = 1/(x −1)2/3.
f ′(1) is not deﬁned, although f (1) is deﬁned. Thus, the (only) singular point occurs at
x = 1. Its coordinates are (1, f (1)) = (1, 0).
3. Endpoints: Let f (x) = 1/x, with domain (−∞, 0) ∪[1, +∞). Then the only end-
point in the domain of f occurs when x = 1 and has coordinates (1, 1). The natural
domain of 1/x has no endpoints.
Example 1 Maxima and Minima
Find the relative and absolute maxima and minima of
f (x) = x2 −2x
on the interval [0, 4].
Solution We ﬁrst calculate f ′(x) = 2x −2. We use this derivative to locate the sta-
tionary and singular points.
Stationary Points To locate the stationary points, we solve the equation f ′(x) = 0, or
2x −2 = 0,
getting x = 1. The domain of the function is [0, 4], so x = 1 is in the domain. Thus,
the only candidate for a stationary relative extremum occurs when x = 1.

Q: How can we be sure that the graph in Example 1 doesn’t look like Figure 8?
A: If it did, there would be another critical point somewhere between x = 1 and x = 4. But we
already know that there aren’t any other critical points. The table we made listed all of the pos-
sible extrema; there can be no more. ■
In Example 1 we found that f ′(1) = 0; f has a stationary point at x = 1. It is also
useful to consider values of f ′(x) to the left and right of the critical point. Here is a
table with some values to the left and right of the critical point x = 1 in the above
example:

Singular Points We look for points where the derivative is not deﬁned. However,
the derivative is 2x −2, which is deﬁned for every x. Thus, there are no singular
points and hence no candidates for singular relative extrema.
Endpoints The domain is [0, 4], so the endpoints occur when x = 0 and x = 4.
We record these values of x in a table, together with the corresponding y-coordinates
(values of f ):
This gives us three points on the graph, (0, 0), (1, –1), and (4, 8), which we plot in
Figure 6.
We remind ourselves that the point (1, –1) is a stationary point of the graph by
drawing in a part of the horizontal tangent line. Connecting these points must give us a
graph something like that in Figure 7.
Notice that the graph has a horizontal tangent line at x = 1 but not at either of the
endpoints because the endpoints are not stationary points.
From Figure 7 we can see that f has the following extrema:

At x = 0, f ′(0) = −2 < 0, so the graph has negative slope and f is decreasing; its val-
ues are going down as x increases. We note this with the downward pointing arrow in the
chart. At x = 2, f ′(2) = 2 > 0, so the graph has positive slope and f is increasing; its
values are going up as x increases. In fact, because f ′(x) = 0 only at x = 1, we know
that f ′(x) < 0 for all x in [0, 1), and we can say that f is decreasing on the interval [0, 1].

Similarly, f is increasing on [1, 4]. So, starting at x = 0, the graph of f goes down until
we reach x = 1 and then it goes back up. Notice that the arrows suggest exactly this type
of graph. This is another way of checking that a critical point is a relative minimum and
is known as the ﬁrst derivative test.3
Note Here is some terminology: If the point (a, b) is a maximum (or minimum) of f, we
sometimes say that f has a maximum (or minimum) value of b at x = a. Thus, in the
above example, we could have said the following:
• f has a relative maximum value of 0 at x = 0.
• f has an absolute minimum value of –1 at x = 1.
• f has an absolute maximum value of 8 at x = 4. ■

Example 2 Unbounded Interval
Find all extrema of f (x) = 3x4 −4x3 on [−1, ∞).
Solution We ﬁrst calculate f ′(x) = 12x3 −12x2.
Stationary points We solve the equation f ′(x) = 0, which is
12x3 −12x2 = 0 or
12x2(x −1) = 0
There are two solutions, x = 0 and x = 1, and both are in the domain. These are
our candidates for the x-coordinates of stationary relative extrema.
Singular points There are no points where f ′(x) is not deﬁned, so there are no sin-
gular points.
Endpoints The domain is [−1, ∞), so there is one endpoint, at x = −1.
We record these points in a table with the corresponding y-coordinates:
3 Why “ﬁrst” derivative test? To distinguish it from a test based on the second derivative of a function, which
we shall discuss in Section 12.3.
We will illustrate three methods we can use to determine which are minima, which are
maxima, and which are neither:
1. Plot these points and sketch the graph by hand.
2. Use the First Derivative Test.
3. Use technology to help us.
Use the method you ﬁnd most convenient.
Using a Hand Plot: If we plot these points by hand, we obtain Figure 9(a), which sug-
gests Figure 9(b).

We can’t be sure what happens to the right of x = 1. Does the curve go up, or does
it go down? To ﬁnd out, let’s plot a “test point” to the right of x = 1. Choosing x = 2,
we obtain y = 3(2)4 −4(2)3 = 16, so (2, 16) is another point on the graph. Thus, it
must turn upwards to the right of x = 1, as shown in Figure 10.
From the graph, we ﬁnd that f has the following extrema:
A relative (endpoint) maximum at (–1, 7)
An absolute (stationary) minimum at (1, –1)
Using the First Derivative Test: List the critical and endpoints in a table, and add addi-
tional points as necessary so that each critical point has a noncritical point on either side.
Then compute the derivative at each of these points, and draw an arrow to indicate the
direction of the graph.

Notice that the arrows now suggest the shape of the curve in Figure 10, and hence per-
mit us to determine that the function has a maximum at x = −1, neither a maximum nor
a minimum at x = 0, and a minimum at x = 1. Deciding which of these extrema are ab-
solute and which are relative requires us to compute y-coordinates and plot the corre-
sponding points on the graph by hand, as we did in the ﬁrst method.
If we use technology to show the graph, we should choose the viewing window so that
it contains the three interesting points we found: x = −1, x = 0, and x = 1. Again, we
can’t be sure yet what happens to the right of x = 1; does the graph go up or down from
that point? If we set the viewing window to an interval of [–1, 2] for x and [–2, 8] for y,
we will leave enough room to the right of x = 1 and below y = −1 to see what the
graph will do. The result will be something like Figure 11.
Now we can tell what happens to the right of x = 1: the function increases. We know
that it cannot later decrease again because if it did, there would have to be another criti-
cal point where it turns around, and we found that there are no other critical points. ■
+Before we go on... Notice that the stationary point at x = 0 in Example 2 is neither a
relative maximum nor a relative minimum. It is simply a place where the graph of f
ﬂattens out for a moment before it continues to fall. Notice also that f has no absolute
maximum because f (x) increases without bound as x gets large. ■

We can rewrite this equation without the negative exponent:
2
3t1/3 = 0
Now, the only way that a fraction can equal 0 is if the numerator is 0, so this frac-
tion can never equal 0. Thus, there are no stationary points.
Singular points The derivative 
f ′(t) =
2
3t1/3
is not deﬁned for t = 0. However, f itself is deﬁned at t = 0, so 0 is in the domain.
Thus, f has a singular point at t = 0.
Endpoints There are two endpoints, –1 and 1.
We now put these three points in a table with the corresponding y-coordinates:
Using a Hand Plot: The derivative, f ′(t) = 2/(3t1/3), is not deﬁned at the singular
point t = 0. To help us sketch the graph, let’s use limits to investigate what happens to
the derivative as we approach 0 from either side:
lim
t→0−f ′(t) = lim
t→0−
2
3t1/3 = −∞
lim
t→0+ f ′(t) = lim
t→0+
2
3t1/3 = +∞
Thus, the graph decreases very steeply, approaching t = 0 from the left, and then rises
very steeply as it leaves to the right. It would make sense to say that the tangent line at
x = 0 is vertical, as shown in Figure 12.
From this graph, we ﬁnd the following extrema for f:
An absolute (endpoint) maximum at (–1, 1)
An absolute (singular) minimum at (0, 0)
An absolute (endpoint) maximum at (1, 1)
Notice that the absolute maximum value of f is achieved at two values of t: t = −1 and
t = 1.

Absolute Extrema on a Closed Interval
If f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then it will have an absolute maximum and
an absolute minimum value on that interval. Each absolute extremum must occur either
at an endpoint or a critical point. Therefore, the absolute maximum is the largest value
in a table of the values of f at the endpoints and critical points, and the absolute mini-
mum is the smallest value.
The function f (x) = 3x −x3 on the interval [0, 2], has one critical point, at x = 1. The
values of f at the critical point and the endpoints of the interval are given in the follow-
ing table:
From this table we can say that the absolute maximum value of f on [0, 2] is 2, which
occurs at x = 1, and the absolute minimum value of f is –2, which occurs at x = 2.
Endpoint

Because there is only one critical point, at t = 0, it is clear from this table that f must de-
crease from t = −1 to t = 0 and then increase from t = 0 to t = 1. To graph f using
technology, choose a viewing window with an interval of [–1, 1] for t and [0, 1] for y.
The result will be something like Figure 12.*
* Many graphing calculators will give you only the right-hand half of the graph shown in Figure 12 because
fractional powers of negative numbers are not, in general, real numbers. To obtain the whole curve, enter the
formula as Y=(x^2)^(1/3), a fractional power of the nonnegative function x2.
In Examples 1 and 3, we could have found the absolute maxima and minima with-
out doing any graphing. In Example 1, after ﬁnding the critical points and endpoints, we
created the following table:
x

f(x)

f(t)

From this table we can see that f must decrease from its value of 0 at x = 0 to –1 at
x = 1, and then increase to 8 at x = 4. The value of 8 must be the largest value it takes
on, and the value of –1 must be the smallest, on the interval [0, 4]. Similarly, in Exam-
ple 3 we created the following table:
From this table we can see that the largest value of f on the interval [–1, 1] is 1 and the
smallest value is 0. We are taking advantage of the following fact, the proof of which
uses some deep and beautiful mathematics (alas, beyond the scope of this book):
As we can see in Example 2 and the following examples, if the domain is not a
closed interval then f may not have an absolute maximum and minimum, and a table of
values as above is of little help in determining whether it does.

12.1 Maxima and Minima
861
Example 4 Domain Not a Closed Interval
Find all extrema of f (x) = x + 1
x .
Solution Because no domain is speciﬁed, we take the domain to be as large as possi-
ble. The function is not deﬁned at x = 0 but is at all other points, so we take its domain
to be (−∞, 0) ∪(0, +∞). We calculate
f ′(x) = 1 −1
x2
Stationary Points Setting f ′(x) = 0, we solve
1 −1
x2 = 0
to ﬁnd x = ±1. Calculating the corresponding values of f, we get the two stationary
points (1, 2) and (–1, –2).
Singular Points The only value of x for which f ′(x) is not deﬁned is x = 0, but
then f is not deﬁned there either, so there are no singular points in the domain.
Endpoints The domain, (−∞, 0) ∪(0, +∞), has no endpoints.
From this scant information, it is hard to tell what f does. If we are sketching the
graph by hand, or using the ﬁrst derivative test, we will need to plot additional “test
points” to the left and right of the stationary points x = ±1.
For the technology approach, let’s choose a viewing window with an interval of [–3, 3]
for x and [–4, 4] for y, which should leave plenty of room to see how f behaves near the
stationary points. The result is something like Figure 13.
From this graph we can see that f has
A relative (stationary) maximum at (–1, –2)
A relative (stationary) minimum at (1, 2)
Curiously, the relative maximum is lower than the relative minimum! Notice also that,
because of the break in the graph at x = 0, the graph did not need to rise to get from
(−1, −2) to (1, 2). ■
So far we have been solving the equation f ′(x) = 0 to obtain our candidates for
stationary extrema. However, it is often not easy—or even possible—to solve equations
analytically. In the next example, we show a way around this problem by using graphing
technology.

Solution In Example 4 of Section 10.5, we saw how to draw the graphs of f and f ′
using technology. Note that the technology formula to use for the graph of f is
((x-1)^2)^(1/3)-0.5*x^2
instead of
(x-1)^(2/3)-0.5*x^2
(Why?)
Figure 14 shows the resulting graphs of f and f ′.

If we extend Xmax beyond x = 2, we ﬁnd that the graph continues downward, appar-
ently without any further interesting behavior.
Stationary Points The graph of f shows two stationary points, both maxima, at around
x = −0.6 and x = 1.2. Notice that the graph of f ′ is zero at precisely these points.
Moreover, it is easier to locate these values accurately on the graph of f ′ because it is
easier to pinpoint where a graph crosses the x-axis than to locate a stationary point.
Zooming in to the stationary point at x ≈−0.6 results in Figure 15.
From the graph of f, we can see that the stationary point is somewhere between –0.58
and –0.57. The graph of f ′ shows more clearly that the zero of f ′, hence the station-
ary point of f lies somewhat closer to –0.57 than to –0.58. Thus, the stationary point
occurs at x ≈−0.57, rounded to two decimal places.
In a similar way, we ﬁnd the second stationary point at x ≈1.18.
Singular Points Going back to Figure 14, we notice what appears to be a cusp (sin-
gular point) at the relative minimum around x = 1, and this is conﬁrmed by a glance
at the graph of f ′, which seems to take a sudden jump at that value. Zooming in closer

suggests that the singular point occurs at exactly x = 1. In fact, we can calculate

From this formula we see clearly that f ′(x) is deﬁned everywhere except at x = 1.

Thus, we have found the following approximate extrema for f:

12.2 Applications of Maxima and Minima

12.2 Applications of Maxima and Minima
In many applications we would like to ﬁnd the largest or smallest possible value of some
quantity—for instance, the greatest possible proﬁt or the lowest cost. We call this the
optimal (best) value. In this section we consider several such examples and use calculus
to ﬁnd the optimal value in each.
In all applications the ﬁrst step is to translate a written description into a mathe-
matical problem. In the problems we look at in this section, there are unknowns that we
are asked to ﬁnd, there is an expression involving those unknowns that must be made as
large or as small as possible—the objective function—and there may be constraints—
equations or inequalities relating the variables.4
4 If you have studied linear programming, you will notice a similarity here, but unlike the situation in linear
programming, neither the objective function nor the constraints need be linear.
Example 1 Minimizing Average Cost
Gymnast Clothing manufactures expensive hockey jerseys for sale to college bookstores
in runs of up to 500. Its cost (in dollars) for a run of x hockey jerseys is
C(x) = 2000 + 10x + 0.2x2
How many jerseys should Gymnast produce per run in order to minimize average cost?*
Solution Here is the procedure we will follow to solve problems like this.
1. Identify the unknown(s). There is one unknown: x, the number of hockey jerseys
Gymnast should produce per run. (We know this because the question is, How many
jerseys. . . ?)
2. Identify the objective function. The objective function is the quantity that must be
made as small (in this case) as possible. In this example it is the average cost, which
is given by
¯C(x) = C(x)
x
= 2000 + 10x + 0.2x2
x
= 2000
x
+ 10 + 0.2x dollars/jersey
3. Identify the constraints (if any). At most 500 jerseys can be manufactured in a run.
Also, ¯C(0) is not deﬁned. Thus, x is constrained by
0 < x ≤500
Put another way, the domain of the objective function ¯C(x) is (0, 500].
4. State and solve the resulting optimization problem. Our optimization problem is:
Minimize ¯C(x) = 2000
x
+ 10 + 0.2x
Objective function
subject to 0 < x ≤500
Constraint
* Why don’t we seek to minimize total cost? The answer would be uninteresting; to minimize total cost, we
would make no jerseys at all. Minimizing the average cost is a more practical objective.

We now solve this problem as in Section 12.1. We ﬁrst calculate
¯C ′(x) = −2000
x2
+ 0.2
We solve ¯C ′(x) = 0 to ﬁnd x = ±100. We reject x = −100 because −100 is not in the
domain of ¯C (and makes no sense), so we have one stationary point, at x = 100. There,
the average cost is ¯C(100) = $50 per jersey.
The only point at which the formula for ¯C′ is not deﬁned is x = 0, but that is not in
the domain of ¯C, so we have no singular points. We have one endpoint in the domain, at
x = 500. There, the average cost is ¯C(500) = $114.
Let’s plot ¯C in a viewing window with the intervals [0, 500] for x and [0, 150] for y,
which will show the whole domain and the two interesting points we’ve found so far.
The result is Figure 16.
From the graph of ¯C, we can see that the stationary point at x = 100 gives the ab-
solute minimum. We can therefore say that Gymnast Clothing should produce 100 jer-
seys per run, for a lowest possible average cost of $50 per jersey. ■
Example 2 Maximizing Area
Slim wants to build a rectangular enclosure
for his pet rabbit, Killer, against the side of
his house, as shown in Figure 17. He has
bought 100 feet of fencing. What are the
dimensions of the largest area that he can
enclose?
Solution
1. Identify the unknown(s). To identify the
unknown(s), we look at the question:
What are the dimensions of the largest area he can enclose? Thus, the unknowns are
the dimensions of the fence. We call these x and y, as shown in Figure 18.
2. Identify the objective function. We look for what it is that we are trying to maximize
(or minimize). The phrase “largest area” tells us that our object is to maximize the
area, which is the product of length and width, so our objective function is
A = xy
where A is the area of the enclosure
3. Identify the constraints (if any). What stops Slim from making the area as large as he
wants? He has only 100 feet of fencing to work with. Looking again at Figure 18, we
see that the sum of the lengths of the three sides must equal 100, so
x + 2y = 100
One more point: Because x and y represent the lengths of the sides of the enclosure,
neither can be a negative number.
4. State and solve the resulting optimization problem. Our mathematical problem is:
Maximize A = xy
Objective function
subject to x + 2y = 100, x ≥0, and y ≥0
Constraints
We know how to ﬁnd maxima and minima of a function of one variable, but A
appears to depend on two variables. We can remedy this by using a constraint to express
Figure 17

12.2 Applications of Maxima and Minima
867
one variable in terms of the other. Let’s take the constraint x + 2y = 100 and solve for
x in terms of y:
x = 100 −2y
Substituting into the objective function gives
A = xy = (100 −2y)y = 100y −2y2
and we have eliminated x from the objective function. What about the inequalities? One
says that x ≥0, but we want to eliminate x from this as well. We substitute for x again,
getting
100 −2y ≥0
Solving this inequality for y gives y ≤50. The second inequality says that y ≥0. Now,
we can restate our problem with x eliminated:
Maximize A(y) = 100y −2y2 subject to 0 ≤y ≤50
We now proceed with our usual method of solving such problems. We calculate
A′(y) = 100 −4y. Solving 100 −4y = 0, we get one stationary point at y = 25. There,
A(25) = 1250. There are no points at which A′(y) is not deﬁned, so there are no singu-
lar points. We have two endpoints, at y = 0 and y = 50. The corresponding areas are
A(0) = 0 and A(50) = 0. We record the three points we found in a table:
y
0
25
50
A(y)
0
1250
0
It’s clear now how A must behave: It increases from 0 at y = 0 to 1250 at y = 25 and
then decreases back to 0 at y = 50. Thus, the largest possible value of A is 1250 square
feet, which occurs when y = 25. To completely answer the question that was asked, we
need to know the corresponding value of x. We have x = 100 −2y, so x = 50 when
y = 25. Thus, Slim should build his enclosure 50 feet across and 25 feet deep (with the
“missing” 50-foot side being formed by part of the house).
Solving an Optimization Problem
1. Identify the unknown(s), possibly with the aid of a diagram. These are usually the
quantities asked for in the problem.
2. Identify the objective function. This is the quantity you are asked to maximize or
minimize. You should name it explicitly, as in “Let S = surface area.”
3. Identify the constraint(s). These can be equations relating variables or inequalities
expressing limitations on the values of variables.
+Before we go on... Notice that the problem in Example 2 came down to ﬁnding the ab-
solute maximum value of A on the closed and bounded interval [0, 50]. As we noted in
the preceding section, the table of values of A at its critical points and the endpoints of
the interval gives us enough information to ﬁnd the absolute maximum. ■
Let’s stop for a moment and summarize the steps we’ve taken in these two
examples.

Now for some further examples.
Example 3 Maximizing Revenue
Cozy Carriage Company builds baby strollers. Using market research, the company esti-
mates that if it sets the price of a stroller at p dollars, then it can sell q = 300,000 −10p2
strollers per year. What price will bring in the greatest annual revenue?
Solution The question we are asked identiﬁes our main unknown, the price p. How-
ever, there is another quantity that we do not know, q, the number of strollers the com-
pany will sell per year. The question also identiﬁes the objective function, revenue,
which is
R = pq
Including the equality constraint given to us, that q = 300,000 −10p2, and the “reality”
inequality constraints p ≥0 and q ≥0, we can write our problem as
Maximize R = pq subject to q = 300,000 −10p2, p ≥0, and q ≥0
We are given q in terms of p, so let’s substitute to eliminate q:
R = pq = p(300,000 −10p2) = 300,000p −10p3
Substituting in the inequality q ≥0, we get
300,000 −10p2 ≥0
Thus, p2 ≤30,000, which gives −100
√
3 ≤p ≤100
√
3. When we combine this with
p ≥0, we get the following restatement of our problem:
Maximize R( p) = 300,000p −10p3 such that 0 ≤p ≤100
√
3
We solve this problem in much the same way we did the preceding one. We calculate
R′( p) = 300,000 −30p2. Setting 300,000 −30p2 = 0, we ﬁnd one stationary point at
p = 100. There are no singular points and we have the endpoints p = 0 and
p = 100
√
3. Putting these points in a table and computing the corresponding values of
R, we get the following:
4. State the optimization problem. This will have the form “Maximize [minimize] the
objective function subject to the constraint(s).”
5. Eliminate extra variables. If the objective function depends on several variables,
solve the constraint equations to express all variables in terms of one particular vari-
able. Substitute these expressions into the objective function to rewrite it as a function
of a single variable. Substitute the expressions into any inequality constraints to help
determine the domain of the objective function.
6. Find the absolute maximum (or minimum) of the objective function. Use the
techniques of the preceding section.

Thus, Cozy Carriage should price its strollers at $100 each, which will bring in the
largest possible revenue of $20,000,000.

Example 4 Optimizing Resources
The Metal Can Company has an order to make cylindrical cans with a volume of
250 cubic centimeters. What should be the dimensions of the cans in order to use the
least amount of metal in their production?
Solution We are asked to ﬁnd the dimensions of the cans. It is traditional to take as the
dimensions of a cylinder the height h and the radius of the base r, as in Figure 19.
We are also asked to minimize the amount of metal used in the can, which is the
area of the surface of the cylinder. We can look up the formula or ﬁgure it out ourselves:
Imagine removing the circular top and bottom and then cutting vertically and ﬂattening
out the hollow cylinder to get a rectangle, as shown in Figure 20.
Figure 19
h
r
Figure 20
h
2r
r
Our objective function is the (total) surface area S of the can. The area of each disc is
πr2, while the area of the rectangular piece is 2πrh. Thus, our objective function is
S = 2πr2 + 2πrh
As usual, there is a constraint: The volume must be exactly 250 cubic centimeters. The
formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = πr2h, so
πr2h = 250
It is easiest to solve this constraint for h in terms of r:
h = 250
πr2
Substituting in the objective function, we get
S = 2πr2 + 2πr 250
πr2 = 2πr2 + 500
r
Now r cannot be negative or 0, but it can become very large (a very wide but very short
can could have the right volume). We therefore take the domain of S(r) to be (0, +∞),
so our mathematical problem is as follows:
Minimize S(r) = 2πr2 + 500
r
subject tor > 0
Now we calculate
S′(r) = 4πr −500
r2

To ﬁnd stationary points, we set this equal to 0 and solve:
4πr −500

So

3√π ≈3.41
The corresponding surface area is approximately S(3.41) ≈220. There are no singular
points or endpoints in the domain.
To see how S behaves near the one stationary point, let’s graph it in a viewing window
with interval [0, 5] for r and [0, 300] for S. The result is Figure 21.
From the graph we can clearly see that the smallest surface area occurs at the sta-
tionary point at r ≈3.41. The height of the can will be
h = 250
πr2 ≈6.83
■
Thus, the can that uses the least amount of metal has a height of approximately 6.83 cen-
timeters and a radius of approximately 3.41 centimeters. Such a can will use approxi-
mately 220 square centimeters of metal.
Before we go on... We obtained the value of r in Example 4 by solving the equation
4πr = 500
r2
This time, let us do things differently: divide both sides by 4π to obtain
r = 500
4πr2 = 125
πr2
and compare what we got with the expression for h:
h = 250
πr2
which we see is exactly twice the expression for r. Put another way, the height is ex-
actly equal to the diameter so that the can looks square when viewed from the side.
Have you ever seen cans with that shape? Why do you think most cans do not have this
shape? ■

Example 5 Allocation of Labor
The Gym Sock Company manufactures cotton athletic socks. Production is partially au-
tomated through the use of robots. Daily operating costs amount to $50 per laborer and
$30 per robot. The number of pairs of socks the company can manufacture in a day is
given by a Cobb-Douglas* production formula
q = 50n0.6r0.4
where q is the number of pairs of socks that can be manufactured by n laborers and r ro-
bots. Assuming that the company wishes to produce 1000 pairs of socks per day at a
minimum cost, how many laborers and how many robots should it use?
Solution The unknowns are the number of laborers n and the number of robots r. The
objective is to minimize the daily cost:
C = 50n + 30r
The constraints are given by the daily quota
1000 = 50n0.6r0.4
and the fact that n and r are nonnegative. We solve the constraint equation for one of the
variables; let’s solve for n:
n0.6 = 1000
50r0.4 = 20
r0.4
Taking the 1/0.6 power of both sides gives
n =
 20
r0.4
1/0.6
= 201/0.6
r0.4/0.6 = 205/3
r2/3 ≈147.36

Substituting in the objective equation gives us the cost as a function of r:
C(r) ≈50
147.36
r2/3

+ 30r
= 7368r−2/3 + 30r
The only remaining constraint on r is that r > 0. To ﬁnd the minimum value of C(r), we
ﬁrst take the derivative:
C′(r) ≈−4912r−5/3 + 30
Setting this equal to zero, we solve for r:
r −5/3 ≈0.006107
r ≈(0.006107)−3/5 ≈21.3
The corresponding cost is C(21.3) ≈$1600. There are no singular points or endpoints
in the domain of C.
To see how C behaves near its stationary point, let’s draw its graph in a viewing window
with an interval of [0, 40] for r and [0, 2000] for C. The result is Figure 22.
* Cobb-Douglas production formulas were discussed in Section 11.4.

From the graph we can see that C does have its minimum at the stationary point. The
corresponding value of n is
n ≈147.36
r2/3
≈19.2
■
At this point, our solution appears to be this: Use (approximately) 19.2 laborers and
(approximately) 21.3 robots to meet the manufacturing quota at a minimum cost. How-
ever, we are not interested in fractions of robots or people, so we need to ﬁnd integer so-
lutions for n and r. If we round these numbers, we get the solution (n, r) = (19, 21).
However, a quick calculation shows that
q = 50(19)0.6(21)0.4 ≈989 pairs of socks
which fails to meet the quota of 1000. Thus we need to round at least one of the quanti-
ties n or r upward in order to meet the quota. The three possibilities, with corresponding
values of q and C, are as follows:
(n, r) = (20, 21), with q ≈1020 and C = $1630
(n, r) = (19, 22), with q ≈1007 and C = $1610
(n, r) = (20, 22), with q ≈1039 and C = $1660
Of these, the solution that meets the quota at a minimum cost is (n, r) = (19, 22).
Thus, the Gym Sock Co. should use 19 laborers and 22 robots, at a cost of
50 × 19 + 30 × 22 = $1610, to manufacture 50 × 190.6 × 220.4 ≈1007 pairs of socks.

dilemma. Its new program, Doors-X 10.27, is almost ready to
go on the market. However, the longer the company works on
it, the better it can make the program and the more it can
charge for it. The company’s marketing analysts estimate that
if it delays t days, it can set the price at 100 + 2t dollars. On
the other hand, the longer it delays, the more market share they
will lose to their main competitor (see the next exercise) so
that if it delays t days it will be able to sell 400,000 −2500t
copies of the program. How many days should FeatureRich
delay the release in order to get the greatest revenue?
48. Marketing Strategy FeatureRich Software’s main competitor
(see previous exercise) is Moon Systems, and Moon is in a
similar predicament. Its product, Walls-Y 11.4, could be sold
now for $200, but for each day Moon delays, it could increase

ture each copy. If a single customer were to buy all the copies
of Dogwood, how many copies would the customer have to
buy for FeatureRich Software’s average proﬁt per copy to be
maximized? How are average proﬁt and marginal proﬁt re-
lated at this number of copies?

The Second Derivative and 
Analyzing Graphs
The second derivative is simply the derivative of the derivative function.To explain why
we would be interested in such a thing, we start by discussing one of its interpretations.
Acceleration 
Recall that if s(t) represents the position of a car at time t, then its velocity is given by
the derivative: v(t) = s′(t). But one rarely drives a car at a constant speed; the velocity
itself is changing. The rate at which the velocity is changing is the acceleration. Since
the derivative measures the rate of change, acceleration is the derivative of velocity:
a(t) = v′(t). Because v is the derivative of s, we can express the acceleration in terms
of s:
a(t) = v′(t) = (s′)′(t) = s′′(t)
That is, a is the derivative of the derivative of s, in other words, the second derivative of
s which we write as s′′. (In this context you will often hear the derivative s′ referred to
as the ﬁrst derivative.)
Second Derivative, Acceleration
The second derivative of a function f is the derivative of the derivative of f, written
as f ′′.
quick Examples
quick Example
1. If f (x) = x3 −x, then f ′(x) = 3x2 −1, so f ′′(x) = 6x.
2. If f (x) = 3x + 1, then f ′(x) = 3, so f ′′(x) = 0.
The acceleration of a moving object is the derivative of its velocity—that is, the second
derivative of the position function.
If t is time in hours and the position of a car at time t is s(t) = t3 + 2t2 miles, then the
car’s velocity is v(t) = s′(t) = 3t2 + 4t miles per hour and its acceleration is a(t) =
s′′(t) = v′(t) = 6t + 4 miles per hour per hour.

12.3 The Second Derivative and Analyzing Graphs
879
Differential Notation for the Second Derivative
We have written the second derivative of f (x) as f ′′(x). We could also use differential
notation:
f ′′(x) = d2f
dx2
This notation comes from writing the second derivative as the derivative of the deriva-
tive in differential notation:
f ′′(x) = d
dx
d f
dx

= d2f
dx2
Similarly, if y = f (x), we write f ′′(x) as d
dx
dy
dx

= d2y
dx2 . For example, if y = x3, 
then d2y
dx2 = 6x .
An important example of acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity.
Example 1 Acceleration Due to Gravity
According to the laws of physics, the height of an object near the surface of the earth
falling in a vacuum from an initial rest position 100 feet above the ground under the in-
ﬂuence of gravity is approximately
s(t) = 100 −16t2 feet
in t seconds. Find its acceleration.
Solution The velocity of the object is 
v(t) = s′(t) = −32t ft/s
Differential notation: v = ds
dt = −32t ft/s
The reason for the negative sign is that the height of the object is decreasing with time,
so its velocity is negative. Hence, the acceleration is 
a(t) = s′′(t) = −32 ft/s2
Differential notation: a = d2s
dt2 = −32 ft/s2
(We write ft/s2 as an abbreviation for feet/second/second—that is, feet per second per
second. It is often read “feet per second squared.”) Thus, the downward velocity is in-
creasing by 32 ft/s every second. We say that 32 ft/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity.
If we ignore air resistance, all falling bodies near the surface of the earth, no matter what
their weight, will fall with this acceleration.*
* On other planets the acceleration due to gravity is different. For example, on Jupiter, it is about three times
as large as on Earth.
+Before we go on... In very careful experiments using balls rolling down inclined
planes, Galileo made one of his most important discoveries—that the acceleration due
to gravity is constant and does not depend on the weight or composition of the object

Applications of the Derivative
falling.26 A famous, though probably apocryphal, story has him dropping cannonballs of
different weights off the Leaning Tower of Pisa to prove his point.27 ■
Example 2 Acceleration of Sales
For the ﬁrst 15 months after the introduction of a new video game, the total sales can be
modeled by the curve
S(t) = 20e0.4t units sold
where t is the time in months since the game was introduced. After about 25 months total
sales follow more closely the curve
S(t) = 100,000 −20e17−0.4t
How fast are total sales accelerating after 10 months? How fast are they accelerating
after 30 months? What do these numbers mean?
Solution By acceleration we mean the rate of change of the rate of change, which is
the second derivative. During the ﬁrst 15 months, the ﬁrst derivative of sales is
dS
dt = 8e0.4t
and so the second derivative is
d2S
dt2 = 3.2e0.4t
Thus, after 10 months the acceleration of sales is 
d2S
dt2

t=10
= 3.2e4 ≈175 units/month/month, or units/month2
We can also compute total sales
S(10) = 20e4 ≈1092 units
and the rate of change of sales
dS
dt

t=10
= 8e4 ≈437 units/month
What do these numbers mean? By the end of the tenth month, a total of 1092 video
games have been sold. At that time the game is selling at the rate of 437 units per month.
This rate of sales is increasing by 175 units per month per month. More games will be
sold each month than the month before.
To analyze the sales after 30 months is similar, using the formula
S(t) = 100,000 −20e17−0.4t
26 An interesting aside: Galileo’s experiments depended on getting extremely accurate timings. Since the time-
pieces of his day were very inaccurate, he used the most accurate time measurement he could: He sang and
used the beat as his stopwatch.
27 A true story: The point was made again during the Apollo 15 mission to the moon (July, 1971) when astro-
naut David R. Scott dropped a feather and a hammer from the same height. The moon has no atmosphere, so
the two hit the surface of the moon simultaneously.

By the end of the 30th month, 97,032 video games have been sold, the game is selling at
a rate of 1187 units per month, and the rate of sales is decreasing by 475 units per month
per month. Fewer games are sold each month than the month before.
Concavity
The ﬁrst derivative of f tells us where the graph of f is rising [where f ′(x) > 0] and
where it is falling [where f ′(x) < 0]. The second derivative tells in what direction the
graph of f curves or bends. Consider the graphs in Figures 23 and 24.
y  f(x)
y  g(x)
Figure 23 
Figure 24
Think of a car driving from left to right along each of the roads shown in the two ﬁgures.
A car driving along the graph of f in Figure 23 will turn to the left (upward); a car dri-
ving along the graph of g in Figure 24 will turn to the right (downward). We say that the
graph of f is concave up while the graph of g is concave down. Now think about the de-
rivatives of f and g. The derivative f ′(x) starts small but increases as the graph gets
steeper. Since f ′(x) is increasing, its derivative f ′′(x) must be positive. On the other
hand, g′(x) decreases as we go to the right. Since g′(x) is decreasing, its derivative
g′′(x) must be negative. Summarizing, we have the following.
Concavity and the Second Derivative
A curve is concave up if its slope is increasing, in which case the second derivative is
positive. A curve is concave down if its slope is decreasing, in which case the second de-
rivative is negative. A point where the graph of f changes concavity, from concave up to
concave down or vice versa, is called a point of inﬂection. At a point of inﬂection, the
second derivative is either zero or undeﬁned.

882
Chapter 12
Applications of the Derivative
The following example shows one of the reasons it’s useful to look at concavity.
Example 3 The Point of Diminishing Returns
After the introduction of a new video game, the worldwide sales are modeled by the curve
S(t) =
1
1 + 50e−0.2t million units sold
where t is the time in months since the game was introduced (compare Example 2). The
graphs of S(t), S′(t) and S′′(t) are shown in Figure 27. 
Where is the graph of S concave up, and where is it concave down? Where are any
points of inﬂection? What does this all mean?
Solution Look at the graph of S. We see that the graph of S is concave up in the early
months and then becomes concave down later. The point of inﬂection, where the con-
cavity changes, is somewhere between 15 and 25 months. 
Now look at the graph of S′′. This graph crosses the t-axis very close to t = 20, is
positive before that point, and negative after that point. Since positive values of S′′ indi-
cate S is concave up and negative values concave down, we conclude that the graph of S
is concave up for about the ﬁrst 20 months; that is, for 0 < t < 20 and concave down for
20 < t < 40. The concavity switches at the point of inﬂection which occurs at about
t = 20 (when S′′(t) = 0; a more accurate answer is t ≈19.56).
What does this all mean? Look at the graph of S′, which shows sales per unit time,
or monthly sales. From this graph we see that monthly sales are increasing for t < 20:
more units are being sold each month than the month before. Monthly sales reach a peak
of 0.05 million = 50,000 games per month at the point of inﬂection t = 20 and then
begin to drop off. Thus, the point of inﬂection is the time when sales stop increasing and
start to fall off. This is sometimes called the point of diminishing returns.Although the
total sales ﬁgure continues to rise (see the graph of S: game units continue to be sold),
the rate at which units are sold starts to drop.
Analyzing Graphs
We now have the tools we need to ﬁnd the most interesting points on the graph of a func-
tion. It is easy to use graphing technology to draw the graph, but we need to use calculus to
understand what we are seeing.The most interesting features of a graph are the following.
quick Examples
Locating Points of Inﬂection
To locate possible points of inﬂection, list points where f ′′(x) = 0 and also points
where f ′′(x) is not deﬁned.
1. The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 25 has
points of inﬂection at approximately x = 1 and x = 3.
2. Consider f (x) = x3 −3x, whose graph is shown in
Figure 26. f ′′(x) = 6x is negative when x < 0 and
positive when x > 0. The graph of f is concave
down when x < 0 and concave up when x > 0. f
has a point of inﬂection at x = 0, where the second
derivative is 0.

Note It is sometimes difﬁcult or impossible to solve all of the equations that come up in
Steps 1, 2, and 3 of the above analysis. As a consequence, we might not be able to say
exactly where the x-intercept, extrema, or points of inﬂection are. When this happens,
we will use graphing technology to assist us in determining accurate numerical approx-
imations. ■
Example 4 Analyzing a Graph
Analyze the graph of f (x) = 1
x −1
x2 .
Solution The graph, as drawn using graphing technology, is shown in Figure 28, using
two different viewing windows. (Note that x = 0 is not in the domain of f.)
The window in Figure 28(b) seems to show the features of the graph better than the
window in Figure 28(a). Does the viewing window in Figure 28(b) include all the in-
teresting features of the graph? Or are there perhaps some interesting features to the
right of x = 10 or to the left of x = −10? Also, where exactly do features like max-
ima, minima, and points of inﬂection occur? In our ﬁve-step process of analyzing the
interesting features of the graph, we will be able to sketch the curve by hand, and also
answer these questions.
1. The x- and y-intercepts: We consider y = 1
x −1
x2 . To ﬁnd the x-intercept(s), we set
y = 0 and solve for x:
0 = 1
x −1
x2
1
x = 1
x2
Multiplying both sides by x2 (we know that x cannot be zero, so we are not multiply-
ing both sides by 0) gives
x = 1
Thus, there is one x-intercept (which we can see in Figure 28) at x = 1. 
For the y-intercept, we would substitute x = 0 and solve for y. However, we can-
not substitute x = 0; because f (0) is not deﬁned, the graph does not meet the y-axis.
We add features to our freehand sketch as we go. Figure 29 shows what we have

1. The x- and y-intercepts: If y = f (x), ﬁnd the x-intercept(s) by setting y = 0 and
solving for x; ﬁnd the y-intercept by setting x = 0 and solving for y. 
2. Relative extrema: Use the technique of Section 12.1 to locate the relative extrema.
3. Points of inﬂection: Use the technique of this section to ﬁnd the points of inﬂection.
4. Behavior near points where the function is not deﬁned: If f (x) is not deﬁned at
x = a, consider limx→a−f (x) and limx→a+ f (x) to see how the graph of f behaves as
x approaches a.
5. Behavior at inﬁnity: Consider limx→−∞f (x) and limx→+∞f (x) if appropriate, to
see how the graph of f behaves far to the left and right.

2. Relative extrema: We calculate f ′(x) = −1
x2 + 2
x3 . To ﬁnd any stationary points, we 
set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for x:
−1
x2 + 2
x3 = 0
1
x2 = 2
x3
x = 2
Thus, there is one stationary point, at x = 2. We can use a test point to the right to de-
termine that this stationary point is a relative maximum:

The only possible singular point is at x = 0 because f ′(0) is not deﬁned. However,
f (0) is not deﬁned either, so there are no singular points. Figure 30 shows our graph
so far.
3. Points of inﬂection: We calculate f ′′(x) = 2
x3 −6
x4 . To ﬁnd points of inﬂection, we 
set the second derivative equal to 0 and solve for x:
2
x3 −6
x4 = 0
2
x3 = 6
x4
2x = 6
x = 3
Figure 28 conﬁrms that the graph of f changes from being concave down to being
concave up at x = 3, so this is a point of inﬂection. f ′′(x) is not deﬁned at x = 0, but
that is not in the domain, so there are no other points of inﬂection. For example, the
graph must be concave down in the whole region (−∞, 0).
Figure 31 shows our graph so far (we extended the curve near x = 3 to suggest a
point of inﬂection at x = 3).
4. Behavior near points where f is not deﬁned: The only point where f (x) is not
deﬁned is x = 0. From the graph, f (x) appears to go to −∞as x approaches 0 from
either side. To calculate these limits, we rewrite f (x):
f (x) = 1
x −1
x2 = x −1
x2
Now, if x is close to 0 (on either side), the numerator x −1 is close to −1 and the de-
nominator is a very small but positive number. The quotient is therefore a negative
number of very large magnitude. Therefore,

x→0−f (x) = −∞

and
lim
x→0+ f (x) = −∞
From these limits, we see the following:
(1) Immediately to the left of x = 0, the graph plunges down toward −∞.
(2) Immediately to the right of x = 0, the graph also plunges down toward −∞. Fig-
ure 32 shows our graph with these features added.
We say that f has a vertical asymptote at x = 0, meaning that the graph approaches
the line x = 0 without touching it.
5. Behavior at inﬁnity: Both 1/x and 1/x2 go to 0 as x goes to −∞or +∞; that is,
lim
x→−∞f (x) = 0
and
lim
x→+∞f (x) = 0
Thus, on the extreme left and right of our picture, the height of the curve levels off to-
ward zero. Figure 33 shows the completed freehand sketch of the graph.
We say that f has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0. (Notice another thing: we
haven’t plotted a single point to the left of the y-axis, and yet we have a pretty good
idea of what the curve looks like there! Compare the technology-drawn curve in Fig-
ure 28).
In summary, there is one x-intercept at x = 1; there is one relative maximum
(which, we can now see, is also an absolute maximum) at x = 2; there is one point of
inﬂection at x = 3, where the graph changes from being concave down to concave up.
There is a vertical asymptote at x = 0, on both sides of which the graph goes down
toward −∞, and a horizontal asymptote at y = 0.
Example 5 Analyzing a Graph 
Analyze the graph of f (x) = 2x
3 −(x −2)2/3 .
Solution
Figure 34 shows a technology-generated version of the graph. (Note that in the technol-
ogy formulation (x −2)2/3 is written as [(x −2)2]1/3 to avoid problems with some
graphing calculators and Excel.)
Let us now recreate this graph by hand, and in the process identify the features we see
in Figure 34.
1. The x- and y-intercepts: We consider y = 2x
3 −(x −2)2/3 . For the y-intercept, we
set x = 0 and solve for y:
y = 2(0)
3
−(0 −2)2/3 = −22/3 ≈−1.59
To ﬁnd the x-intercept(s), we set y = 0 and solve for x. However, if we attempt this, we
will ﬁnd ourselves with a cubic equation that is hard to solve. (Try it!) Following the
advice in the note on p. 883, we use graphing technology to locate the x-intercept we see
in Figure 34 by zooming in (Figure 35). From Figure 35, we ﬁnd x ≈1.24. We shall
see in the discussion to follow that there can be no other x-intercepts.

2. Relative extrema: We calculate 
f ′(x) = 2
3 −2
3(x −2)−1/3
= 2
3 −

3(x −2)1/3
To ﬁnd any stationary points, we set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for x:
2
3 −
2
3(x −2)1/3 = 0
(x −2)1/3 = 1
x −2 = 13 = 1
x = 3
To check for singular points, look for points where f (x) is deﬁned and f ′(x) is not
deﬁned. The only such point is x = 2: f ′(x) is not deﬁned at x = 2, whereas f (x) is
deﬁned there, so we have a singular point at x = 2.

Figure 37 shows our graph so far.
We see that there is a singular relative maximum at (2, 4/3) (we will conﬁrm that
the graph eventually gets higher on the right) and a stationary relative minimum at
x = 3.
3. Points of inﬂection: We calculate 
f ′′(x) =
2
9(x −2)4/3
To ﬁnd points of inﬂection, we set the second derivative equal to 0 and solve for x. But
the equation
0 =
2
9(x −2)4/3
has no solution for x, so there are no points of inﬂection on the graph.
4. Behavior near points where f is not deﬁned: Because f (x) is deﬁned everywhere,
there are no such points to consider. In particular, there are no vertical asymptotes.
5. Behavior at inﬁnity: We estimate the following limits numerically:
lim
x→−∞
2x
3 −(x −2)2/3

= −∞
and
lim
x→+∞
2x
3 −(x −2)2/3

= +∞
Thus, on the extreme left the curve goes down toward −∞, and on the extreme right
the curve rises toward +∞. In particular, there are no horizontal asymptotes. (There
can also be no other x-intercepts.)
Figure 38 shows the completed graph.

We start by recalling some basic facts about the rate of change of a quantity:
quick Examples
Rate of Change of Q
If Q is a quantity changing over time t, then the derivative dQ/dt is the rate at which Q
changes over time.
1. If A is the area of an expanding circle, then d A/dt is the rate at which the area is
increasing.
2. Words: The radius r of a sphere is currently 3 cm and increasing at a rate of 2 cm/s.
Symbols: r = 3 cm and dr/dt = 2 cm/s.
In this section we are concerned with what are called related rates problems. In such a
problem we have two (sometimes more) related quantities, we know the rate at which
one is changing, and we wish to ﬁnd the rate at which another is changing. A typical
example is the following.

894
Chapter 12
Applications of the Derivative
Example 1 The Expanding Circle
The radius of a circle is increasing at a rate of 10 cm/s. How fast is the area increasing
at the instant when the radius has reached 5 cm?
Solution We have two related quantities: the radius of the circle, r, and its area, A. The
ﬁrst sentence of the problem tells us that r is increasing at a certain rate. When we see a
sentence referring to speed or change, it is very helpful to rephrase the sentence using
the phrase “the rate of change of.” Here, we can say
The rate of change of r is 10 cm/s.
Because the rate of change is the derivative, we can rewrite this sentence as the equation
dr
dt = 10
Similarly, the second sentence of the problem asks how A is changing. We can rewrite
that question:
What is the rate of change of A when the radius is 5 cm?
Using mathematical notation, the question is:
What is dA
dt when r = 5?
Thus, knowing one rate of change, dr/dt, we wish to ﬁnd a related rate of change,
d A/dt. To ﬁnd exactly how these derivatives are related, we need the equation relating
the variables, which is 
A = πr2
To ﬁnd the relationship between the derivatives, we take the derivative of both sides of
this equation with respect to t. On the left we get d A/dt. On the right we need to re-
member that r is a function of t and use the chain rule. We get
d A
dt = 2πr dr
dt
Now we substitute the given values r = 5 and dr/dt = 10. This gives
d A
dt

r=5
= 2π(5)(10) = 100π ≈314 cm2/s
Thus, the area is increasing at the rate of 314 cm2/s when the radius is 5 cm.
We can organize our work as follows:
Solving a Related Rates Problem
A. The Problem
1. List the related, changing quantities.
2. Restate the problem in terms of rates of change. Rewrite the problem using mathe-
matical notation for the changing quantities and their derivatives.

We can illustrate the procedure with the “ladder problem” found in almost every
calculus textbook.
Example 2 The Falling Ladder
Jane is at the top of a 5-foot ladder when it starts to slide down the wall at a rate of 3 feet
per minute. Jack is standing on the ground behind her. How fast is the base of the ladder
moving when it hits him if Jane is 4 feet from the ground at that instant?
Solution The ﬁrst sentence talks about (the top of) the ladder sliding down the wall.
Thus, one of the changing quantities is the height of the top of the ladder. The question
asked refers to the motion of the base of the ladder, so another changing quantity is the
distance of the base of the ladder from the wall. Let’s record these variables and follow
the outline above to obtain the solution.
A. The Problem
1. The changing quantities are
h = height of the top of the ladder
b = distance of the base of the ladder from the wall
2. We rephrase the problem in words, using the phrase “rate of change”:
The rate of change of the height of the top of the ladder is −3 feet per minute.
What is the rate of change of the distance of the base from the wall when the top
of the ladder is 4 feet from the ground?
We can now rewrite the problem mathematically:
dh
dt = −3. Find db
dt when h = 4
B. The Relationship
1. Figure 39 shows the ladder and the variables h and b. Notice that we put in the ﬁgure
the ﬁxed length, 5, of the ladder, but any changing quantities, like h and b, we leave
as variables. We shall not use any speciﬁc values for h or b until the very end.
2. From the ﬁgure, we can see that h and b are related by the Pythagorean theorem:
h2 + b2 = 25
B. The Relationship
1. Draw a diagram, if appropriate, showing the changing quantities.
2. Find an equation or equations relating the changing quantities.
3. Take the derivative with respect to time of the equation(s) relating the quantities to
get the derived equation(s), which relate the rates of change of the quantities.
C. The Solution
1. Substitute into the derived equation(s) the given values of the quantities and their
derivatives.
2. Solve for the derivative required.
h
b

Figure 39

Chapter 12
Applications of the Derivative
3. Taking the derivative with respect to time of the equation above gives us the derived
equation:
2h dh
dt + 2bdb
dt = 0
C. The Solution
1. We substitute the known values dh/dt = −3 and h = 4 into the derived equation:
2(4)(−3) + 2bdb
dt = 0
We would like to solve for db/dt, but ﬁrst we need the value of b, which we can de-
termine from the equation h2 + b2 = 25, using the value h = 4:
16 + b2 = 25
b2 = 9
b = 3
Substituting into the derived equation, we get
−24 + 2(3) db
dt = 0
2. Solving for db/dt gives
db
dt = 24
6 = 4
Thus, the base of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at 4 ft/min when it hits Jack.

C(x) = 10,000 + 20x +
x2
10,000 dollars
The daily production level is currently x = 5000 cell phones and is increasing at a rate
of 100 units per day. How fast is the average cost changing?
Solution
A. The Problem
1. The changing quantities are the production level x and the average cost, ¯C.
2. We rephrase the problem as follows:
The daily production level is x = 5000 units and the rate of change of x is 100
units/day. What is the rate of change of the average cost, ¯C?
In mathematical notation,
x = 5000 and dx
dt = 100. Find d ¯C
dt
B. The Relationship
1. In this example the changing quantities cannot easily be depicted geometrically.
2. We are given a formula for the total cost. We get the average cost by dividing the total
cost by x:

Example 4 Allocation of Labor
The Gym Sock Company manufactures cotton athletic socks. Production is partially
automated through the use of robots. The number of pairs of socks the company can
manufacture in a day is given by a Cobb-Douglas production formula:
q = 50n0.6r0.4
where q is the number of pairs of socks that can be manufactured by n laborers and r
robots. The company currently produces 1000 pairs of socks each day and employs
20 laborers. It is bringing one new robot on line every month. At what rate are laborers
being laid off, assuming that the number of socks produced remains constant?

3 laborers per month
The company is laying off laborers at a rate of 2/3 per month, or two every three months. 
We can interpret this result as saying that, at the current level of production and
number of laborers, one robot is as productive as 2/3 of a laborer, or 3 robots are as
productive as 2 laborers.

44 Coming up with a good demand equation is not always easy. We saw in Chapter 1 that it is possible to ﬁnd
a linear demand equation if we know the sales ﬁgures at two different prices. However, such an equation is
only a ﬁrst approximation. To come up with a more accurate demand equation, we might need to gather data
corresponding to sales at several different prices and use curve-ﬁtting techniques like regression. Another ap-

12.5 Elasticity
You manufacture an extremely popular brand of sneakers and want to know what will
happen if you increase the selling price. Common sense tells you that demand will drop
as you raise the price. But will the drop in demand be enough to cause your revenue to
fall? Or will it be small enough that your revenue will rise because of the higher selling
price? For example, if you raise the price by 1%, you might suffer only a 0.5% loss in
sales. In this case, the loss in sales will be more than offset by the increase in price and
your revenue will rise. In such a case, we say that the demand is inelastic, because it is
not very sensitive to the increase in price. On the other hand, if your 1% price increase
results in a 2% drop in demand, then raising the price will cause a drop in revenues. We
then say that the demand is elastic because it reacts strongly to a price change.
We can use calculus to measure the response of demand to price changes if we have
a demand equation for the item we are selling.44 We need to know the percentage drop
in demand per percentage increase in price. This ratio is called the elasticity of de-
mand, or price elasticity of demand, and is usually denoted by E. Let’s derive a for-
mula for E in terms of the demand equation.

Assume that we have a demand equation
q = f ( p)
where q stands for the number of items we would sell (per week, per month, or what
have you) if we set the price per item at p. Now suppose we increase the price p by a very
small amount, p. Then our percentage increase in price is (p/p) × 100%. This in-
crease in p will presumably result in a decrease in the demand q. Let’s denote this cor-
responding decrease in q by −q (we use the minus sign because, by convention, q
stands for the increase in demand). Thus, the percentage decrease in demand is
(−q/q) × 100%.
Now E is the ratio
E = Percentage decrease in demand
Percentage increase in price
so
E =
−q
q × 100%
p
p × 100%
Canceling the 100%s and reorganizing, we get
E = −q
p · p
q
Q: What small change in price will we use for p?
A: It should probably be pretty small. If, say, we increased the price of sneakers to $1 million
per pair, the sales would likely drop to zero. But knowing this tells us nothing about how the
market would respond to a modest increase in price. In fact, we’ll do the usual thing we do in
calculus and let p approach 0. ■
In the expression for E, if we let p go to 0, then the ratio q/p goes to the
derivative dq/dp. This gives us our ﬁnal and most useful deﬁnition of the elasticity.

quick Example
Price Elasticity of Demand
The price elasticity of demand E is the percentage rate of decrease of demand per
percentage increase in price. E is given by the formula
E = −dq
dp · p
q
We say that the demand is elastic if E > 1, is inelastic if E < 1, and has unit elasticity
if E = 1.
Suppose that the demand equation is q = 20,000 −2p where p is the price in dollars.
Then
E = −(−2)
p
20,000 −2p =
p
10,000 −p
If p = $2000, then E = 1/4, and demand is inelastic at this price.
If p = $8000, then E = 4, and demand is elastic at this price.
If p = $5000, then E = 1, and the demand has unit elasticity at this price.

We are generally interested in the price that maximizes revenue and, in ordinary
cases, the price that maximizes revenue must give unit elasticity. One way of seeing this
is as follows:45 If the demand is inelastic (which ordinarily occurs at a low unit price)
then raising the price by a small percentage—1% say—results in a smaller percentage
drop in demand. For example, in the Quick Example above, if p = $2000, then the de-
mand would drop by only 1
4% for every 1% increase in price. To see the effect on rev-
enue, we use the fact46 that, for small changes in price,
Percentage change in revenue ≈Percentage change in price
+ Percentage change in demand
= 1 +

−1
4

= 3
4%
Thus, the revenue will increase by about 3/4%. Put another way:
If the demand is inelastic, raising the price increases revenue.
On the other hand, if the price is elastic (which ordinarily occurs at a high unit price),
then increasing the price slightly will lower the revenue, so:
If the demand is elastic, lowering the price increases revenue.
The price that results in the largest revenue must therefore be at unit elasticity.

As a Network Manager for
United Behavioral Health (UBH),
my objective is to enable UBH
members to obtain high-quality,
affordable 
behavioral 
health
care by providing an outstanding
panel of clinicians and facilities
with sufficient availability to
meet member needs.
To determine the adequacy of our clinical network we
first determine a utilization rate. A utilization rate is the
extent to which insured members utilize mental health/
substance abuse services. We use this number to determine
the number of clinicians and facilities needed to meet the
needs of our membership. An analysis is completed to review
the existing network against urban, suburban, and rural ac-
cess standards. Clinician-to-member and facility-to-member
ratios are assessed, along with the linguistic and cultural
competency of the network as compared to U.S. Census data.
If a network is found to be below standard on any of these
measures, an action plan is developed to enhance the network
via targeted recruitment in order to close any potential net-
work gap as quickly as possible.
Clinicians who are contracted with a managed care or-
ganization agree to accept a negotiated rate for their ser-
vices. This rate is an important factor when recruiting and
contracting with clinicians. The managed care model is built
on the principle that the managed care organization provides
volume in exchange for a discounted fee. These negotiated
rates are created using many factors. These factors consist
of values based on human and financial resources consumed
in the delivery of each procedure as well as the cost of
malpractice insurance. This value is then multiplied by a con-
version factor to take into account regional differences in
service locations.
In addition to maintaining and recruiting clinicians for
our insured members, I must also report many statistics re-
quired for state and federal regulatory bodies as well as other
accrediting organizations.
Throughout my 13 year career in managed care I have
worked with both medical and mental health providers and
have also held positions in sales and accounting. All of these
functions within managed care rely heavily on mathematics.
As I progress in my field I realize more and more the impor-
tant role that mathematics plays in not only managed care,
but life.

Example 1 Price Elasticity of Demand: Dolls
Suppose that the demand equation for Bobby Dolls is given by q = 216 −p2, where p
is the price per doll in dollars and q is the number of dolls sold per week.
a. Compute the price elasticity of demand when p = $5 and p = $10, and interpret
the results.
b. Find the ranges of prices for which the demand is elastic and the range for which the
demand is inelastic.
c. Find the price at which the weekly revenue is maximized. What is the maximum
weekly revenue?
Solution
a. The price elasticity of demand is
E = −dq
dp · p
q
Taking the derivative and substituting for q gives
E = 2p ·
p
216 −p2 =
2p2
216 −p2
When p = $5,
E =
2(5)2
216 −52 = 50
191 ≈0.26
Thus, when the price is set at $5, the demand is dropping at a rate of 0.26% per 1%
increase in the price. Because E < 1, the demand is inelastic at this price, so raising
the price will increase revenue.
When p = $10,
E =
2(10)2
216 −102 = 200
116 ≈1.72
Thus, when the price is set at $10, the demand is dropping at a rate of 1.72% per 1% in-
crease in the price. Because E > 1, demand is elastic at this price, so raising the price
will decrease revenue; lowering the price will increase revenue.
b. and c. We answer part (c) ﬁrst. Setting E = 1, we get
2p2
216 −p2 = 1
p2 = 72
Thus, we conclude that the maximum revenue occurs when p =
√
72 ≈$8.49. We can
now answer part (b): The demand is elastic when p > $8.49 (the price is too high), and
the demand is inelastic when p < $8.49 (the price is too low). Finally, we calculate the
maximum weekly revenue, which equals the revenue corresponding to the price of
$8.49:
R = qp = (216 −p2) p = (216 −72)
√
72 = 144
√
72 ≈$1222

The concept of elasticity can be applied in other situations. In the following exam-
ple we consider income elasticity of demand—the percentage increase in demand for a
particular item per percentage increase in personal income.

Example 2 Income Elasticity of Demand: Porsches
You are the sales director at Suburban Porsche and have noticed that demand for
Porsches depends on income according to
q = 0.005e−0.05x2+x
(1 ≤x ≤10)
Here, x is the income of a potential customer in hundreds of thousands of dollars and q
is the probability that the person will actually purchase a Porsche.* The income elastic-
ity of demand is
E = dq
dx
x
q
Compute and interpret E for x = 2 and 9.
Solution
Q: Why is there no negative sign in the formula?
A: Because we anticipate that the demand will increase as income increases, the ratio
Percentage increase in demand
Percentage increase in income
will be positive, so there is no need to introduce a negative sign. ■
Turning to the calculation, since q = 0.005e−0.05x2+x ,
dq
dx = 0.005e−0.05x2+x(−0.1x + 1)
and so
E = dq
dx
x
q
= 0.005e−0.05x2+x(−0.1x + 1)
x
0.005e−0.05x2+x
= x(−0.1x + 1)
When x = 2, E = 2[−0.1(2) + 1)] = 1.6. Thus, at an income level of $200,000, the
probability that a customer will purchase a Porsche increases at a rate of 1.6% per 1%
increase in income.
When x = 9, E = 9[−0.1(9) + 1)] = 0.9. Thus, at an income level of $900,000,
the probability that a customer will purchase a Porsche increases at a rate of 0.9% per
1% increase in income.
* In other words, q is the fraction of visitors to your showroom having income x who actually purchase a
Porsche.

15. Modeling Linear Demand You have been hired as a market-
ing consultant to Johannesburg Burger Supply, Inc., and you
wish to come up with a unit price for its hamburgers in order
to maximize its weekly revenue. To make life as simple as
possible, you assume that the demand equation for Johannes-
burg hamburgers has the linear form q = mp + b, where p is
the price per hamburger, q is the demand in weekly sales, and
m and b are certain constants you must determine.
a. Your market studies reveal the following sales ﬁgures:
When the price is set at $2.00 per hamburger, the sales
amount to 3000 per week, but when the price is set at
$4.00 per hamburger, the sales drop to zero. Use these
data to calculate the demand equation.
b. Now estimate the unit price that maximizes weekly revenue
and predict what the weekly revenue will be at that price.
16. Modeling Linear Demand You have been hired as a market-
ing consultant to Big Book Publishing, Inc., and you have
been approached to determine the best selling price for the hit
calculus text by Whiner and Istanbul entitled Fun with Deriv-
atives. You decide to make life easy and assume that the de-
mand equation for Fun with Derivatives has the linear form
q = mp + b, where p is the price per book, q is the demand
in annual sales, and m and b are certain constants you’ll have
to ﬁgure out.
a. Your market studies reveal the following sales ﬁgures:
when the price is set at $50.00 per book, the sales amount
to 10,000 per year; when the price is set at $80.00 per
book, the sales drop to 1000 per year. Use these data to
calculate the demand equation.
b. Now estimate the unit price that maximizes annual rev-
enue and predict what Big Book Publishing, Inc.’s annual
revenue will be at that price.

Applications of the Derivative
If you decide to print all 1,200,000 books (the total demand for the year, 100,000
books per month for 12 months) in a single run at the start of the year and sales run as
predicted, then the number of books in stock would begin at 1,200,000 and decrease to
zero by the end of the year, as shown in Figure 40.

On average, you would be storing 600,000 books for 12 months at 1¢ per book, giving
a total storage cost of 600,000 × 12 × .01 = $72,000. The setup cost for the single print
run would be $5000. When you add to these the total cost of producing 1,200,000 books
at $1 per book, your total cost would be $1,277,000.
If, on the other hand, you decide to cut down on storage costs by printing the books
in two runs of 600,000 each, you would get the picture shown in Figure 41.
Now, the storage cost would be cut in half because on average there would be only
300,000 books in stock. Thus, the total storage cost would be $36,000, and the setup cost
would double to $10,000 (because there would now be two runs). The production costs
would be the same: 1,200,000 books @ $1 per book. The total cost would therefore be
reduced to $1,246,000, a savings of $31,000 compared to your ﬁrst scenario.
“Aha!” you say to yourself, after doing these calculations. “Why not drastically cut
costs by setting up a run every month?” You calculate that the setup costs alone would
be 12 × $5000 = $60,000, which is already more than the setup plus storage costs for
two runs, so a run every month will cost too much. Perhaps, then, you should investigate
three runs, four runs, and so on, until you ﬁnd the lowest cost. This strikes you as too la-
borious a process, especially considering that you will have to do it all over again when
planning for Laﬂeur’s sequel, Lorenzo’s Lost Love, due to be released next year. Realiz-
ing that this is an optimization problem, you decide to use some calculus to help you
come up with a formula that you can use for all future plans. So you get to work.
Instead of working with the number 1,200,000, you use the letter N so that you can
be as ﬂexible as possible. (What if Lorenzo’s Lost Love sells more copies?) Thus, you
have a total of N books to be produced for the year. You now calculate the total cost of
using x print runs per year. Because you are to produce a total of N books in x print runs,

you will have to produce N/x books in each print run. N/x is called the lot size. As you
can see from the diagrams above, the average number of books in storage will be half
that amount, N/(2x).
Now you can calculate the total cost for a year. Write P for the setup cost of a sin-
gle print run (P = $5000 in your case) and c for the annual cost of storing a book (to
convert all of the time measurements to years; c = $0.12 here). Finally, write b for the
cost of producing a single book (b = $1 here). The costs break down as follows.
Setup Costs: x print runs @ P dollars per run: 
Px
Storage Costs: N/(2x) books stored @ c dollars per year: cN/(2x)
Production Costs: N books @ b dollars per book:
Nb
Total Cost: Px + cN
2x + Nb
Remember that P, N, c, and b are all constants and x is the only variable. Thus, your cost
function is
C(x) = Px + cN
2x + Nb
and you need to ﬁnd the value of x that will minimize C(x). But that’s easy! All you need
to do is ﬁnd the relative extrema and select the absolute minimum (if any).
The domain of C(x) is (0, +∞) because there is an x in the denominator and x can’t
be negative. To locate the extrema, you start by locating the critical points:
C′(x) = P −cN
2x2
The only singular point would be at x = 0, but 0 is not in the domain. To ﬁnd stationary
points, you set C′(x) = 0 and solve for x:
P −cN
2x2 = 0
2x2 = cN
P
so
x =

cN
2P
There is only one stationary point, and there are no singular points or endpoints. To
graph the function you will need to put in numbers for the various constants. Substitut-
ing N = 1,200,000, P = 5000, c = 0.12, and b = 1, you get
C(x) = 5000x + 72,000

The total cost at the stationary point is
C(3.79) ≈1,240,000
You now graph C(x) in a window that includes the stationary point, say, 0 ≤x ≤12 and
1,100,000 ≤C ≤1,500,000, getting Figure 42.
From the graph, you can see that the stationary point is an absolute minimum. In the
graph it appears that the graph is always concave up, which also tells you that your

stationary point is a minimum. You can check the concavity by computing the second
derivative:
C′′(x) = cN
x3 > 0
The second derivative is always positive because c, N, and x are all positive numbers, so
indeed the graph is always concave up. Now you also know that it works regardless of
the particular values of the constants.
So now you are practically done! You know that the absolute minimum cost occurs
when you have x ≈3.79 print runs per year. Don’t be disappointed that the answer is not
a whole number; whole number solutions are rarely found in real scenarios. What the
answer (and the graph) do indicate is that either 3 or 4 print runs per year will cost the
least money. If you take x = 3, you get a total cost of
C(3) = $1,239,000
If you take x = 4, you get a total cost of
C(4) = $1,238,000
So, four print runs per year will allow you to minimize your total costs.

same. How many print runs should you use now?
2. In general, what happens to the number of runs that minimizes cost if both the setup
cost and the total number of books are doubled?
3. In general, what happens to the number of runs that minimizes cost if the setup cost
increases by a factor of 4?
4. Assuming that the total number of copies and storage costs are as originally stated,

5. Assuming that the total number of copies and setup cost are as originally stated, ﬁnd

6. In Figure 41 we assumed that all the books in each run were manufactured in a very

the inventory, assuming a slower rate of production.

The Integral
Introduction
Roughly speaking, calculus is divided into two parts: differential calculus (the calcu-
lus of derivatives) and integral calculus, which is the subject of this chapter and the
next. Integral calculus is concerned with problems that are in some sense the reverse of
the problems seen in differential calculus. For example, where differential calculus
shows how to compute the rate of change of a quantity, integral calculus shows how to
ﬁnd the quantity if we know its rate of change. This idea is made precise in the Fun-
damental Theorem of Calculus. Integral calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus allow us to solve many problems in economics, physics, and geometry, in-
cluding one of the oldest problems in mathematics—computing areas of regions with
curved boundaries.
The Indeﬁnite Integral
Suppose that we knew the marginal cost to manufacture an item and we wanted to re-
construct the cost function. We would have to reverse the process of differentiation, to
go from the derivative (the marginal cost function) back to the original function (the
total cost). We’ll ﬁrst discuss how to do that and then look at some applications.
Here is an example: If the derivative of F(x) is 4x3, what was F(x)? We recognize
4x3 as the derivative of x4. So, we might have F(x) = x4. However, F(x) = x4 + 7
works just as well. In fact, F(x) = x4 + C works for any number C. Thus, there are
inﬁnitely many possible answers to this question.
In fact, we will see shortly that the formula F(x) = x4 + C covers all possible
answers to the question. Let’s give a name to what we are doing.
Thus,
If the derivative of A(x) is B(x), then an antiderivative of B(x) is A(x).
We call the set of all antiderivatives of a function the indeﬁnite integral of the
function.
Indefinite Integral

f (x) dx
is read “the indeﬁnite integral of f (x) with respect to x” and stands for the set of all
antiderivatives of f. Thus, 

f (x) dx is a collection of functions; it is not a single function,
quick Examples
Antiderivative
An antiderivative of a function f is a function F such that F′ = f .
1. An antiderivative of 4x3 is x4.
Because the derivative of x4 is 4x3
2. Another antiderivative of 4x3 is x4 + 7.
Because the derivative of x4 + 7 is 4x3
3. An antiderivative of 2x is x2 + 12.
Because the derivative of x2 + 12 is 2x

13.1 The Indeﬁnite Integral
921
The constant of integration C reminds us that we can add any constant and get a
different antiderivative.
Q: If F (x) is one antiderivative of f(x), why must all other antiderivatives have the
form F (x) + C?
A: Suppose F (x) and G(x) are both antiderivatives of f(x), so that F ′(x) = G ′(x). Consider
what this means by looking at Figure 1. ■
If F′(x) = G′(x) for all x, then F and G have the same slope at each value of x. This
means that their graphs must be parallel and hence remain exactly the same vertical dis-
tance apart. But that is the same as saying that the functions differ by a constant—that
is, that G(x) = F(x) + C for some constant C.1

1 This argument can be turned into a more rigorous proof—that is, a proof that does not rely on geometric
concepts such as “parallel graphs.” We should also say that the result requires that F and G have the same
derivative on an interval [a, b].

Because the derivative of the right-hand side is the integrand x, we can conclude that

Now, we would like to make the process of ﬁnding indeﬁnite integrals (antiderivatives)
more mechanical. For example, it would be nice to have a power rule for indeﬁnite inte-
grals similar to the one we already have for derivatives. Two cases suggested by the ex-
amples above are:

You should check the last equation by taking the derivative of its right-hand side. These
cases suggest the following general statement:

variable x is called the variable of integration.

* We are glossing over a subtlety here: The constant of integration C can be different for x < 0 and x > 0
because the graph breaks at x = 0. In general, our understanding will be that the constant of integration may
be different on disconnected intervals of the domain.

Q: What is the reason for the restriction n ̸= −1?
A: The right-hand side of the power rule formula has n + 1 in the denominator, and thus makes
no sense if n = −1. This leaves us not yet knowing how to compute

x−1 dx =
 1
x dx
Computing this derivative amounts to finding a function whose derivative is 1/x. Prodding our
memories a little, we recall that ln x has derivative 1/x. In fact, as we pointed out when we
first discussed it, ln|x| also has derivative 1/x, but it has the advantage that its domain is the
same as that of 1/x. Thus, we can fill in the missing case as follows:

x−1 dx = ln |x| + C

For more complicated functions, like 2x3 + 6x5 −1, we need the following rules for in-
tegrating sums, differences, and constant multiples.

This and two other indeﬁnite integrals that come from corresponding formulas for dif-
ferentiation are summarized here:

Proof of the Sum Rule
We saw above that if two functions have the same derivative, they differ by a (possibly
zero) constant. Look at the rule for sums:

[ f (x) + g(x)] dx =

f (x) dx +

g(x) dx
If we take the derivative of the left-hand side with respect to x, we get the integrand,
f (x) + g(x). If we take the derivative of the right-hand side, we get

Because the left- and right-hand sides have the same derivative, they differ by a con-
stant. But, because both expressions are indeﬁnite integrals, adding a constant does not
affect their value, so they are the same as indeﬁnite integrals.
Notice that a key step in the proof was the fact that the derivative of a sum is the sum
of the derivatives.
A similar proof works for the difference and constant multiple rule.

just “integrate term by term,” much as we learned to differentiate term by term.

+Before we go on... You should check each of the answers in Example 2 by
differentiating.
Q: Why is there only a single arbitrary constant C in each of the answers?
A: We could have written the answer to part (a) as
x4
4 + D + x6
6 + E −x + F
where D, E, and F are all arbitrary constants. Now suppose, for example, we set D = 1, E = −2,
and F = 6. Then the particular antiderivative we get is x4/4 + x6/6 −x + 5, which has the form
x4/4 + x6/6 −x + C . Thus, we could have chosen the single constant C to be 5 and obtained
the same answer. In other words, the answer x4/4 + x6/6 −x + C is just as general as the
answer x4/4 + D + x6/6 + E −x + F , but simpler. ■

Application: Cost and Marginal Cost
Example 5 Finding Cost from Marginal Cost
The marginal cost to produce baseball caps at a production level of x caps is 4 −0.001x
dollars per cap, and the cost of producing 100 caps is $500. Find the cost function.
Solution We are asked to ﬁnd the cost function C(x), given that the marginal cost
function is 4 −0.001x. Recalling that the marginal cost function is the derivative of the
cost function, we can write
C′(x) = 4 −0.001x
and must ﬁnd C(x). Now C(x) must be an antiderivative of C′(x), so
C(x) =

(4 −0.001x) dx
= 4x −0.001x2
2 + K
= 4x −0.0005x2 + K

Now, unless we have a value for K, we don’t really know what the cost function is. How-
ever, there is another piece of information we have ignored: The cost of producing 100
baseball caps is $500. In symbols
C(100) = 500
* We used K and not C for the constant of integration because we are using C for cost.

Application: Motion in a Straight Line
An important application of the indeﬁnite integral is to the study of motion. The appli-
cation of calculus to problems about motion is an example of the intertwining of math-
ematics and physics. We begin by bringing together some facts, scattered through the
last several chapters, that have to do with an object moving in a straight line, and then
restating them in terms of antiderivatives.
13.1 The Indeﬁnite Integral
927
Substituting in our formula for C(x), we have
C(100) = 4(100) −0.0005(100)2 + K
500 = 395 + K
K = 105
Now that we know what K is, we can write down the cost function:
C(x) = 4x −0.0005x2 + 105
+Before we go on... Let us consider the signiﬁcance of the constant term 105 in Exam-
ple 5. If we substitute x = 0 into the cost function, we get
C(0) = 4(0) −0.0005(0)2 + 105 = 105
Thus, $105 is the cost of producing zero items; in other words, it is the ﬁxed cost. ■

Example 6 Motion in a Straight Line
a. The velocity of a particle moving along in a straight line is given by v(t) = 4t + 1 m/sec.
Given that the particle is at position s = 2 meters at time t = 1, ﬁnd an expression for s
in terms of t.
b. For a freely falling body experiencing no air resistance and zero initial velocity, ﬁnd
an expression for the velocity v in terms of t. [Note: On Earth, a freely falling body
experiencing no air resistance accelerates downward at approximately 9.8 meters per
second per second, or 9.8 m/s2 (or 32 ft/s2).]
Solution
a. As we saw in the Quick Example above, the position of the particle after t seconds is
given by 
s(t) =

v(t) dt
=

(4t + 1) dt = 2t2 + t + C
But what is the value of C? Now, we are told that the particle is at position s = 2 at
time t = 1. In other words, s(1) = 2. Substituting this into the expression for s(t)
gives
2 = 2(1)2 + 1 + C
So
C = −1
Hence the position after t seconds is given by
s(t) = 2t2 + t −1 meters.
b. Let’s measure heights above the ground as positive, so that a rising object has positive
velocity and the acceleration due to gravity is negative (it causes the upward velocity
to decrease in value). Thus, the acceleration of the stone is given by
a(t) = −9.8 m/s2
We wish to know the velocity, which is an antiderivative of acceleration, so we
compute
v(t) =

a(t) dt =

(−9.8) dt = −9.8t + C
To ﬁnd the value of C, we use the given information that at time t = 0 the velocity is
0 : v(0) = 0. Substituting this into the expression for v(t) gives
0 = −9.8(0) + C
so
C = 0
Hence the velocity after t seconds is given by
v(t) = −9.8t m/s

c. When and where will the stone reach its zenith, its highest point?
Solution
a. This is similar to Example 6(b): Measuring height above the ground as positive, the
acceleration of the stone is given by a(t) = −32 ft/s2, and so
v(t) =

(−32) dt = −32t + C
To obtain C, we use the fact that you tossed the stone upward at 30 ft/s; that is, when
t = 0, v = 30, or v(0) = 30. Thus,
30 = v(0) = −32(0) + C
so C = 30 and the formula for velocity is v(t) = −32t + 30 ft/sec. In particular, after
5 seconds the velocity will be
v(5) = −32(5) + 30 = −130 ft/s
After 5 seconds the stone is falling with a speed of 130 ft/s.
b. We wish to know the position, but position is an antiderivative of velocity. Thus,
s(t) =

v(t) dt =

(−32t + 30) dt = −16t2 + 30t + C
Now to ﬁnd C, we need to know the initial position s(0). We are not told this, so let’s
measure heights so that the initial position is zero. Then
0 = s(0) = C
and s(t) = −16t2 + 30t. In particular, after 5 seconds the stone has a height of
s(5) = −16(5)2 + 30(5) = −250 ft
In other words, the stone is now 250 ft below where it was when you ﬁrst threw it, as
shown in Figure 2.
c. The stone reaches its zenith when its height s(t) is at its maximum value, which oc-
curs when v(t) = s′(t) is zero. So we solve
v(t) = −32t + 30 = 0
getting t = 30/32 = 15/16 = 0.9375 s. This is the time when the stone reaches its
zenith. The height of the stone at that time is
s(15/16) = −16(15/16)2 + 30(15/16) = 14.0625 ft

Substitution
The chain rule for derivatives gives us an extremely useful technique for ﬁnding
antiderivatives. This technique is called change of variables or substitution.
Recallthattodifferentiateafunctionlike(x2 + 1)6,weﬁrstthinkofthefunctionasg(u)
where u = x2 + 1 and g(u) = u6. We then compute the derivative, using the chain rule, as
d
dx g(u) = g′(u) du
dx
Any rule for derivatives can be turned into a technique for ﬁnding antiderivatives. The
chain rule turns into the following formula:

g′(u) du
dx dx = g(u) + C

But, if we write g(u) + C =

g′(u)du, we get the following interesting equation:

g′(u) du
dx dx =

g′(u)du
This equation is the one usually called the change of variables formula. We can turn it
into a more useful integration technique as follows. Let f = g′(u)(du/dx). We can
rewrite the above change of variables formula using f:

f dx =
 
f
du/dx

du
In essence, we are making the formal substitution
dx =
1
du/dx du
Here’s the technique:
13.2 Substitution
933
Substitution Rule
If u is a function of x, then we can use the following formula to evaluate an integral:

f dx =
 
f
du/dx

du
Rather than use the formula directly, we use the following step-by-step procedure:
1. Write u as a function of x.
2. Take the derivative du/dx and solve for the quantity dx in terms of du.
3. Use the expression you obtain in Step 2 to substitute for dx in the given integral and
substitute u for its deﬁning expression.
Now let’s see how this procedure works in practice.
Example 1 Substitution
Find 

4x(x2 + 1)6dx.
Solution To use substitution we need to choose an expression to be u. There is no hard
and fast rule, but here is one hint that often works:
Take u to be an expression that is being raised to a power.
In this case, let’s set u = x2 + 1. Continuing the procedure above, we place the calcula-
tions for step (2) in a box.
Write u as a function of x.
Take the derivative of u with respect to x.
Solve for dx: dx =
1
du/dx du.
u = x2 + 1
du
dx = 2x
dx = 1
2x du

Chapter 13

Now we substitute u for its deﬁning expression, and substitute for dx in the original
integral:

4x(x2 + 1)6 dx =

4xu6 1
2x du
Substitute* for u and dx.


2u6du
Cancel the xs and simplify.
We have boiled the given integral down to the much simpler integral 

2u6du, and we
can now write down the solution:
2u7
7 + C = 2(x2 + 1)7
7
+ C
Substitute (x2 + 1) for u in the answer.
* This step is equivalent to using the formula stated in the Substitution Rule box. If it should bother you that
the integral contains both x and u, note that x is now a function of u.
+Before we go on... There are two points to notice in Example 1. First, before we can
actually integrate with respect to u, we must eliminate all xs from the integrand. If we
cannot, we may have chosen the wrong expression for u. Second, after integrating, we
must substitute back to obtain an expression involving x.
It is easy to check our answer. We differentiate:
d
dx
2(x2 + 1)7
7

= 2(7)(x2 + 1)6(2x)
7
= 4x(x2 + 1)6
✔
Notice how we used the chain rule to check the result obtained by substitution. ■
When we use substitution, the ﬁrst step is always to decide what to take as u. Again,
there are no set rules, but we see some common cases in the examples.
Example 2 More Substitution
Calculate 

x2(x3 + 1)2dx.
Solution
As we said in Example 1, it often works to take u to be an expression that is being raised
to a power. We usually also want to see the derivative of u as a factor in the integrand so
that we can cancel terms involving x. In this case, x3 + 1 is being raised to a power, so
let’s set u = x3 + 1. Its derivative is 3x2; in the integrand is x2, which is missing the
factor 3, but missing or incorrect constant factors are not a problem.
Write u as a function of x.
Take the derivative of u with respect to x.
Solve for dx: dx =

u = x3 + 1

Solution There are two parenthetical expressions. Notice however, that the derivative
of the expression (x2 + 6x) is 2x + 6, which is twice the term (x + 3) in front of the
radical. Recall that we would like the derivative of u to appear as a factor. Thus, let’s take
u = x2 + 6x.
u = x2 + 6x

(x −5)2 dx .
Solution We ﬁrst rewrite

2x
(x −5)2 dx =

2x(x −5)−2dx
This suggests that we should set u = x −5.
Now, there is nothing in the integrand to cancel the x that appears. If, as here, there is
still an x in the integrand after substituting, we go back to the expression for u, solve for
x, and substitute the expression we obtain for x in the integrand. So, we take u = x −5
and solve for x = u + 5. Substituting, we get

Example 7 Application: iPod Sales
The rate of sales of Apple iPods from the fourth quarter of 2002 through the third quar-
ter of 2004 could be roughly approximated by the logistic function
r(t) = 1100e0.6t
9 + e0.6t thousand iPods per quarter
(−1 ≤t ≤6)
where t is time in quarters since the ﬁrst quarter of 2003.*
a. Find an expression for the total number of iPods sold since the ﬁrst quarter of 2003
(t = 0).
b. Roughly how many iPods were sold in 2003?
Solution
a. If we write the total number of iPods sold from the ﬁrst quarter of 2003 to time t as
N(t), then the information we are given says that
N ′(t) = r(t) = 1100e0.6t
9 + e0.6t
Thus,
N(t) =
 1100e0.6t
9 + e0.6t dt
is the function we are after. To integrate the expression, take u to be the denominator
of the integrand:
(Why could we drop the absolute value in the last step?)
Now what is C? Because N(t) represents the total number of iPods sold since
time t = 0, we have N(0) = 0 (because that is when we started counting). Thus,
0 = 1800 ln(9 + e0.6(0)) + C
= 1800 ln(10) + C
C = −1800 ln(10) ≈−4100
Therefore, the total number of iPods sold since the ﬁrst quarter of 2003 is approximately
N(t) = 1800 ln(9 + e0.6t) −4100 thousand iPods
b. Since the last quarter of 2003 ended when t = 4, the total number of iPods sold in
2003 was approximately
N(4) = 1800 ln(9 + e0.6(4)) −4100 ≈1300 thousand iPods†
* Based on a logistic regression. Source for data: Apple Computer, Inc., quarterly earnings reports, available
at www.apple.com.
† The actual number of iPods sold in 2003 was 939 thousand. This discrepancy results from a less than perfect
ﬁt of the logistic model to the actual data.

The Integral
+Before we go on... You might wonder why we are writing a logistic function in the
form we used in Example 7 rather than in one of the “standard” forms 
N
1 + Ab−t or
N
1 + Ae−kt . Our only reason for doing this is to make the substitution work. To convert
from the second “standard” form to the form we used in the example, multiply top and
bottom by ekt. (See Exercises 67 and 68 in Section 13.4 for further discussion.) ■
Shortcuts
The following shortcuts allow us to simply write down the antiderivative in cases where
we would otherwise need the substitution u = ax + b, as in Example 4. (a and b are
constants with a ̸= 0.) All of the shortcuts can be obtained using the substitution
u = ax + b. Their derivation will appear in the exercises.

When to Use Substitution and What to Use for u
Q: If I am asked to calculate an antiderivative, how do I know when to use a substitution and
when not to use one?
A: Do not use substitution when integrating sums, differences, and/or constant multiples of 
powers of x and exponential functions, such as 2x3 −4
x2 + 1
2x + 3x + 2x

13.2 Substitution
939
●basic skills
To recognize when you should try a substitution, pretend that you are differentiating the
given expression instead of integrating it. If differentiating the expression would require use of
the chain rule, then integrating that expression may well require a substitution, as in, say,
x(3x2 −4)3 or (x + 1)ex2+2x−1. (In the first we have a quantity cubed, and in the second we
have e raised to a quantity.) ■
Q: If an integral seems to call for a substitution, what should I use for u?
A: There are no set rules for deciding what to use for u, but the preceding examples show
some common patterns:
• If you see a linear expression raised to a power, try setting u equal to that linear expression.
For example, in (3x −2)−3, set u = 3x – 2. (Alternatively, try using the shortcuts above.)
• If you see a constant raised to a linear expression, try setting u equal to that linear expres-
sion. For example, in 3(2x+1), set u = 2x + 1. (Alternatively, try a shortcut.)
• If you see an expression raised to a power multiplied by the derivative of that expression (or a
constant multiple of the derivative), try setting u equal to that expression. For example, in
x2(3x3 −4)−1, set u = 3x3 – 4.
• If you see a constant raised to an expression, multiplied by the derivative of that expression
(or a constant multiple of its derivative), try setting u equal to that expression. For example, in
5(x + 1)ex2+2x−1, set u = x2 + 2x – 1.
• If you see an expression in the denominator and its derivative (or a constant multiple of its 
derivative) in the numerator, try setting u equal to that expression. For example, in
23x
3 −23x ,
set u = 3 – 23x.
Persistence often pays off: if a certain substitution does not work, try another approach or a
different substitution. ■

The Deﬁnite Integral: Numerical 
and Graphical Approaches
In Sections 13.1 and 13.2, we discussed the indeﬁnite integral. There is an older, related
concept called the deﬁnite integral. Let’s introduce this new idea with an example. (We’ll
drop hints now and then about how the two types of integral are related. In Section 13.4 we
discuss the exact relationship, which is one of the most important results in calculus.)
Using the substitution u = x2 −1

Let’s start with a very crude estimate of the total cost, using the graph as a guide. The
marginal cost at the beginning of your call is c(0) = 5/(0 + 1) = $5 per hour. If this cost
were to remain constant for the length of your call, the total cost of the call would be
Cost of Call = Cost per hour × Number of hours = 5 × 2 = $10
Figure 4 shows how we can represent this calculation on the graph of c(t).

The cost per hour based on c(0) = 5 is represented by the y-coordinate of the graph at
its left edge, while the number of hours is represented by the width of the interval [0, 2]
on the x-axis. Therefore, computing the area of the shaded rectangle in the ﬁgure gives
the same calculation:
Area of rectangle = Cost per hour × Number of hours
= 5 × 2 = $10 = Cost of Call
But, as we see in the graph, the marginal cost does not remain constant, but goes
down quite dramatically over the course of the call. We can obtain a somewhat more ac-
curate estimate of the total cost by looking at the call hour by hour—that is, by dividing
Royalty Free/Corbis
In Section 13.1, we used antiderivatives to answer questions of the form “Given the
marginal cost, compute the total cost” (see Example 5 in Section 13.1). In this section we
approach such questions more directly, and we will forget about antiderivatives for now.

Area of ﬁrst rectangle = Cost per hour × Number of hours
= c(0) × 1 = $5 = Cost of ﬁrst hour
Area of second rectangle = Cost per hour × Number of hours
= c(1) × 1 ≈$0.45 = Cost of second hour
If we assume that the phone company is honest about c(t) being the marginal cost
and is actually calculating your cost more than once an hour, we get an even better esti-
mate of the cost by looking at the call by using four divisions of a half-hour each. The
calculation for this estimate is
c(0) × 0.5 + c(0.5) × 0.5 + c(1) × 0.5 + c(1.5) × 0.5
≈2.500 + 0.417 + 0.227 + 0.156 = $3.30
Calculation using 4 subdivisions
As we see in Figure 6, we have now computed the combined area of four rectangles
each of whose heights is again determined by the height of the graph at its left edge.
13.3 The Deﬁnite Integral: Numerical and Graphical Approaches

the length of the call into two equal intervals, or subdivisions. We estimate the cost of
each one-hour subdivision, using the marginal cost at the beginning of that hour.
Cost of ﬁrst hour = Cost per hour × Number of hours
= c(0) × 1 = 5 × 1 = $5
Cost of second hour = Cost per hour × Number of hours
= c(1) × 1 = 5/11 × 1 ≈$0.45
Adding these costs gives us the more accurate estimate
c(0) × 1 + c(1) × 1 = $5.45
Calculation using 2 subdivisions
In Figure 5 we see that we are computing the combined area of two rectangles, each of
whose heights is determined by the height of the graph at its left edge:

Notice how the cost seems to be decreasing as we use more subdivisions. More impor-
tantly, total cost seems to be getting closer to the area under the graph. Figure 7 illus-
trates the calculation for 8 equal subdivisions. The approximate total cost using 8 subdi-
visions is the total area of the shaded region in Figure 7:
c(0) × 0.25 + c(0.25) × 0.25 + c(0.5) × 0.25 + · · · + c(1.75) × 0.25 ≈$2.31
Calculation using 8 subdivisions
Looking at Figure 7, one still gets the impression that we are being overcharged, es-
pecially for the ﬁrst period. If the phone company wants to be really honest about c(t)
being the marginal cost, it should really be calculating your cost continuously, minute by
minute or, better yet, second-by-second, as illustrated in Figure 8.

Figure 8 strongly suggests that the more accurately we calculate the total cost, the closer
the answer gets to the exact area under the portion of the graph of c(t) with 0 ≤t ≤2,
and leads us to the conclusion that the exact total cost is the exact area under the mar-
ginal cost curve for 0 ≤t ≤2. In other words, we have made the following remarkable
discovery:
Total cost is the area under the marginal cost curve!
+Before we go on... The minute-by-minute calculation in Example 1 is tedious to do by
hand, and no one in their right mind would even attempt to do the second-by-second cal-
culation by hand! Below we discuss ways of doing these calculations with the aid of
technology. ■
The type of calculation done in Example 1 is useful in many applications. Let’s look
at the general case and give the result a name.
In general, we have a function f (such as the function c in the example) and we con-
sider an interval [a, b] of possible values of the independent variable x. We subdivide the
interval [a, b] into some number of segments of equal length. Write n for the number of
segments, or subdivisions.
Next, we label the endpoints of these subdivisions x0 for a, x1 for the end of the ﬁrst
subdivision, x2 for the end of the second subdivision, and so on until we get to xn, the
end of the nth subdivision, so that xn = b. Thus,
a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b
The ﬁrst subdivision is the interval [x0, x1], the second subdivision is [x1, x2], and so on
until we get to the last subdivision, which is [xn−1, xn]. We are dividing the interval

[a, b] into n subdivisions of equal length, so each segment has length (b −a)/n. We
write x for (b −a)/n (Figure 9).

Having established this notation, we can write the calculation that we want to do as
follows: For each subdivision [xk−1, xk], compute f (xk−1), the value of the function f at
the left endpoint. Multiply this value by the length of the interval, which is x. Then add
together all n of these products to get the number
f (x0)x + f (x1)x + · · · + f (xn−1)x
This sum is called a (left) Riemann12 sum for f. In Example 1 we computed several dif-
ferent Riemann sums. Here is the computation for n = 4 we used in the cell phone ex-
ample (see Figure 10):
12 After Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866).
Left Riemann Sum = f (x0)x + f (x1)x + · · · + f (xn−1)x
= f (0)(0.5) + f (0.5)(0.5) + f (1)(0.5) + f (1.5)(0.5)
≈(5)(0.5) + (0.833)(0.5) + (0.455)(0.5) + (0.313)(0.5) ≈3.30
Because sums are often used in mathematics, mathematicians have developed a short-
hand notation for them. We write
f (x0)x + f (x1)x + · · · + f (xn−1)x as
n−1

k=0
f (xk)x
The symbol  is the Greek letter sigma and stands for summation. The letter k here is
called the index of summation, and we can think of it as counting off the segments. We
read the notation as “the sum from k = 0 to n −1 of the quantities f (xk)x.” Think of
it as a set of instructions:
Set k = 0, and calculate f (x0)x.
f (0)(0.5) in the above calculation
Set k = 1, and calculate f (x1)x.
f (0.5)(0.5) in the above calculation
. . .
Set k = n −1, and calculate f (xn−1)x.
f (1.5)(0.5) in the above calculation
Then sum all the quantities so calculated.

the interval [a, b] is deﬁned to be

= f (x0)x + f (x1)x + · · · + f (xn−1)x

where a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b are the subdivisions, and x = (b −a)/n.
Interpretation of the Riemann Sum
If f is the rate of change of a quantity F (that is, f = F′), then the Riemann sum of f
approximates the total change of F from x = a to x = b. The approximation improves
as the number of subdivisions increases toward inﬁnity.
If f (t) is the rate of change in the number of bats in a bell tower and [a, b] = [2, 3], then
the Riemann sum approximates the total change in the number of bats in the tower from
time t = 2 to time t = 3.
Visualizing a Left Riemann Sum (Nonnegative Function)
Graphically, we can represent a left Riemann sum of a nonnegative function as an
approximation of the area under a curve:
Riemann Sum = Shaded Area = Area of ﬁrst rectangle + Area of second rectangle + · · · +
Area of nth rectangle = f (x0)x + f (x1)x + f (x2)x + · · · + f (xn−1)x
In Example 1 we computed several Riemann sums, including these:
n = 1:
Riemann sum = c(0)t = 5 × 2 = $10
n = 2:
Riemann sum = [c(t0) + c(t1)]t
= [c(0) + c(1)] · (1) ≈$5.45
n = 4:
Riemann sum = [c(t0) + c(t1) + c(t2) + c(t3)]t
= [c(0) + c(0.5) + c(1) + c(1.5)] · (0.5) ≈$3.30
n = 8:
Riemann sum = [c(t0) + c(t1) + · · · + c(t7)]t
= [c(0) + c(0.25) + · · · + c(1.75)] · (0.25) ≈$2.31

Note To visualize the Riemann sum of a function that is negative, look again at the
formula f (x0)x + f (x1)x + f (x2)x + · · · + f (xn−1)x for the Riemann sum.
Each term f (xi)xi represents the area of one rectangle in the ﬁgure above. So, the
areas of the rectangles with negative values of f (xi) are automatically counted as nega-
tive. They appear as gold rectangles in Figure 11. ■

Example 2 Computing a Riemann Sum From a Graph
Figure 12 shows the approximate rate f at which convicts have been given the death sen-
tence in the U.S. since 1980 (t is time in years since 1980.)*
Use a left Riemann sum with 4 subdivisions to estimate the total number of death
sentences handed down from 1985 to 2005.
Solution Let us represent the total number of death sentences handed down since the
institution of the death sentence up to time t by F(t). The total number of death
sentences handed down from 1985 to 2005 is then the total change in F over the interval
[5, 25]. In view of the above discussion, we can approximate the total change in F using
a Riemann sum of its rate of change f. Because n = 4 subdivisions are speciﬁed, the
width of each subdivision is
x = b −a
n
= 25 −5
4
= 5
We can therefore represent the left Riemann sum by the shaded area shown in Figure 13.
From the graph,
Left Sum = f (5)t + f (10)t + f (15)t + f (20)t
= (275)(5) + (300)(5) + (275)(5) + (200)(5) = 5250
So, we estimate that a total of 5250 death sentences were handed down during the given
period.
* The death penalty was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976. Source for data through 2003: Bureau
of Justice Statistics, NAACP Defense Fund Inc./New York Times, September 15, 2004, p. A16.
+Before we go on... Although in this section we focus primarily on left Riemann sums,
we could also approximate the total in Example 2 using a right Riemann sum, as
shown Figure 14.
For continuous functions, the distinction between these two types of Riemann sums
approaches zero as the number of subdivisions approaches inﬁnity (see below). ■
Example 3 Computing a Riemann Sum From a Formula
Compute the left Riemann sum for f (x) = x2 + 1 over the interval [−1, 1], using
n = 5 subdivisions.
Solution Because the interval is [a, b] = [−1, 1] and n = 5, we have
x = b −a
n
= 1 −(−1)
5
= 0.4
Width of subdivisions

Thus, the subdivisions of [−1, 1] are given by
−1 < −0.6 < −0.2 < 0.2 < 0.6 < 1
Start with −1 and keep adding x = 0.4.
Figure 15 shows the graph with a representation of the Riemann sum.
The Riemann sum we want is
[ f (x0) + f (x1) + · · · + f (x4)]x
= [ f (−1) + f (−0.6) + f (−0.2) + f (0.2) + f (0.6)]0.4
We can conveniently organize this calculation in a table as follows:

As in Example 1, we’re most interested in what happens to the Riemann sum when
we let n get very large. When f is continuous,13 its Riemann sums will always approach
a limit as n goes to inﬁnity. (This is not meant to be obvious. Proofs may be found in ad-
vanced calculus texts.) We give the limit a name.

The Definite Integral
If f is a continuous function, the deﬁnite integral of f from a to b is deﬁned to be the
limit of the Riemann sums as the number of partitions approaches inﬁnity:
 b

n→∞

k=0
f (xk) x
In Words: The integral, from a to b, of f (x) dx equals the limit, as n →∞, of the
Riemann Sum with a partition of n subdivisions.
The function f is called the integrand, the numbers a and b are the limits of inte-
gration, and the variable x is the variable of integration. A Riemann sum with a large
number of subdivisions may be used to approximate the deﬁnite integral.
Interpretation of the Deﬁnite Integral
If f is the rate of change of a quantity F (that is, f = F′), then 
 b
a f (x) dx is the (exact)
total change of F from x = a to x = b.

1. Remember that

x or t is just a name we give the variable.
2. The notation for the deﬁnite integral (due to Leibniz) comes from the notation for the
Riemann sum. The integral sign 

is an elongated S, the Roman equivalent of the
Greek . The d in dx is the lowercase Roman equivalent of the Greek .
3. The deﬁnition above is adequate for continuous functions, but more complicated de-
ﬁnitions are needed to handle other functions. For example, we broke the interval
[a, b] into n subdivisions of equal length, but other deﬁnitions allow a partition of
the interval into subdivisions of possibly unequal lengths. We have evaluated f at the
left endpoint of each subdivision, but we could equally well have used the right end-
point or any other point in the subdivision. All of these variations lead to the same
answer when f is continuous.
4. The similarity between the notations for the deﬁnite integral and the indeﬁnite inte-
gral is no mistake. We will discuss the exact connection in the next section. ■
Computing Definite Integrals
In some cases, we can compute the deﬁnite integral directly from the graph (see the
quick examples above and the next example below). In general, the only method of com-
puting deﬁnite integrals we have discussed so far is numerical estimation: compute the
Riemann sums for larger and larger values of n and then estimate the number it seems to
be approaching as we did in Example 1. (In the next section we will discuss an algebraic
method for computing them.)

Use the graph to estimate the total U.S. consumption of oil over the period shown.
Solution The derivative f ′(t) represents the rate of change of the U.S. consumption of
oil, and so the total U.S. consumption of oil over the given period [0, 9] is given by the
deﬁnite integral:
Total U.S. consumption of oil = Total change in f ′(t) =

One way to determine the area is to count the number of ﬁlled rectangles as deﬁned by
the grid. Each rectangle has an area of 1 × 0.5 = 0.5 units (so that the half-rectangles
determined by diagonal portions of the graph have half that area). Counting rectangles,
we ﬁnd a total of 68 complete rectangles, so
Total area = 34
Because f ′(t) is in billions of barrels per year, we conclude that the total U.S. con-
sumption of oil over the given period was about 34 billion barrels.
While counting rectangles might seem easy, it becomes awkward in cases involving
large numbers of rectangles or partial rectangles whose area is not easy to determine.
Rather than counting rectangles, we can get the area by averaging the left and right
Riemann sums whose subdivisions are determined by the grid:
Left Sum = (3 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3.5 + 4)(1) = 33.5
Right Sum = (3.5 + 3.5 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3.5 + 4 + 4)(1) = 34.5
Average = 33.5 + 34.5
2
= 34
To see why this works, look at the single interval [0,1]. The left sum contributes
3 × 1 = 3 and the right sum contributes 3.5 × 1 = 3.5. The exact area is their average,
3.25 (Figure 18).
+Before we go on... It is important to check that the units we are using in Example 4
match up correctly: t is given in years and f ′(t) is given in billions of barrels per year.
The integral is then given in
Years × Billions of barrels
Year
= Billions of barrels
If we had speciﬁed f ′(t) in, say, billions of barrels per day but t in years, then we would
have needed to convert either t or f ′(t) so that the units of time match. ■

The next example illustrates the use of technology in estimating deﬁnite integrals using
Riemann sums.

Use technology to estimate the area under the graph of f (x) = 1 −x2 over the interval

f (xk)x = [ f (0) + f (0.01) + · · · + f (0.99)](0.01)
Similarly, the Riemann sum with n = 200 has x = (b −a)/n = (1 −0)/200 = 0.005
and is given by
199

k=0
f (xk)x = [ f (0) + f (0.005) + · · · + f (0.995)](0.005)
For n = 500, x = (b −a)/n = (1 −0)/500 = 0.002 and the Riemann sum is
499

k=0
f (xk)x = [ f (0) + f (0.002) + · · · + f (0.998)](0.002)
See the Technology Guides at the end of the chapter to ﬁnd out how to compute these
sums on a TI-83/84 and Excel.
From the numerical results, we ﬁnd the following Riemann sums:
n = 100:
99

k=0
f (xk)x = 0.67165
n = 200:

k=0
f (xk)x = 0.6691625
n = 500:

f (xk)x = 0.667666
so we estimate that the area under the curve is about 0.667. (The exact answer is 2/3, as
we will be able to verify using the techniques in the next section.)

Example 6 Motion
A fast car has velocity v(t) = 6t2 + 10t ft/s after t seconds (as measured by a radar gun).
Use several values of n to ﬁnd the distance covered by the car from time t = 3 seconds to
time t = 4 seconds.
Solution Because the velocity v(t) is rate of change of position, the total change in
position over the interval [3, 4] is
Distance covered = Total change in position =

v(t) dt =

(6t2 + 10t) dt
As in Examples 1 and 5, we can subdivide the one-second interval [3, 4] into smaller and
smaller pieces to get more and more accurate approximations of the integral. By com-
puting Riemann sums for various values of n, we get the following results.
n = 10:

k = 0
v(tk)t = 106.41
n = 100:

v(tk)t ≈108.974
n = 10,000:

k = 0

These calculations suggest that the total distance covered by the car, the value of the
deﬁnite integral, is approximately 109 feet.

in Section 13.1. Do you notice a relationship between antiderivatives and deﬁnite inte-
grals? This will be explored in the next section. ■

The Deﬁnite Integral: Algebraic Approach
and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
In Section 13.3 we saw that the deﬁnite integral of the marginal cost function gives the
total cost. However, in Section 13.1 we used antiderivatives to recover the cost function
from the marginal cost function, so we could use antiderivatives to compute total
cost. The following example, based on Example 5 in Section 13.1, compares these two
approaches.
Example 1 Finding Cost from Marginal Cost
The marginal cost of producing baseball caps at a production level of x caps is
4 −0.001x dollars per cap. Find the total change of cost if production is increased from
100 to 200 caps.
Solution
Method 1: Using an Antiderivative (based on Example 5 in Section 13.1): Let C(x)
be the cost function. Because the marginal cost function is the derivative of the cost
function, we have C′(x) = 4 −0.001x and so
C(x) =

(4 −0.001x) dx
= 4x −0.001x2
2 + K
= 4x −0.0005x2 + K
K is the constant of integration.

960
Chapter 13
The Integral
Although we do not know what to use for the value of the constant K, we can say:
Cost at production level of 100 caps = C(100)
= 4(100) −0.0005(100)2 + K = $395 + K
Cost at production level of 200 caps = C(200)
= 4(200) −0.0005(200)2 + K = $780 + K
Therefore,
Total change in cost = C(200) −C(100)
= ($780 + K) −($395 + K) = $385
Notice how the constant of integration simply canceled out! So, we could choose any
value for K that we wanted (such as K = 0) and still come out with the correct total
change. Put another way, we could use any antiderivative of C′(x), such as
F(x) = 4x −0.0005x2
F(x) is any antiderivative of C′(x)
or 
F(x) = 4x −0.0005x2 + 4
whereas C(x) is the actual cost function
compute F(200) −F(100), and obtain the total change, $385.
Summarizing this method: To compute the total change of C(x) over the interval
[100, 200], use any antiderivative F(x) of C′(x), and compute F(200) −F(100).
Method 2: Using a Deﬁnite Integral (based on Example 1 in Section 13.3): Because
the marginal cost C(x) is the rate of change of the total cost function C(x), the total
change in C(x) over the interval [100, 200] is given by
Total change in cost = Area under the marginal cost function curve
=
 200
100
C′(x) dx
=
 200
100
(4 −0.001x) dx
= $385
Putting these two methods together gives us the following surprising result:
 200
100
C′(x) dx = F(200) −F(100)
where F(x) is any antiderivative of C′(x).

Figure 20
Now, there is nothing special in Example 1 about the speciﬁc function C′(x) or the
choice of endpoints of integration. So if we replace C′(x) by a general continuous
function f (x), we can write
 b
a
f (x) dx = F(b) −F(a)
where F(x) is any antiderivative of f (x). This result is known as the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus.
See Figure 20.

13.4 The Deﬁnite Integral: Algebraic Approach and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

quick Example
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)
Let f be a continuous function deﬁned on the interval [a, b] and if F is any antideriva-
tive of f and is deﬁned on [a, b], we have
 b
a
f (x) dx = F(b) −F(a)
Moreover, such an antiderivative is guaranteed to exist.
In Words
Every continuous function has an antiderivative. To compute the deﬁnite integral of
f (x) over [a, b], ﬁrst ﬁnd an antiderivative F(x), then evaluate it at x = b, evaluate it at

Example 2 Using the FTC to Calculate a Definite Integral
Calculate 
 1

(1 −x2) dx
Solution To use the FTC, we need to ﬁnd an antiderivative of 1 −x2. But we know 
that

(1 −x2) dx = x −x3
3 + C
We need only one antiderivative, so let’s take F(x) = x −x3/3. The FTC tells us that

which is the value we estimated in Section 13.4.
+Before we go on... A useful piece of notation is often used here. We write30

When calculating a deﬁnite integral, we may have to use substitution to ﬁnd the
necessary antiderivative. We could substitute, evaluate the indeﬁnite integral with re-
spect to u, express the answer in terms of x, and then evaluate at the limits of integration.
However, there is a shortcut, as we shall see in the next example.

Example 5 Total Cost
In Section 13.3 we considered the following example. Your cell phone company offers
you an innovative pricing scheme. When you make a call, the marginal cost is
c(t) =

10t + 1 dollars per hour
Compute the total cost of a two-hour phone call.

Compare this with Example 1 of Section 13.3, where we found the same answer by
approximating with Riemann sums.

Example 6 Computing Area
Find the total area of the region enclosed by the graph of y = xex 2, the x-axis, and the
vertical lines x = −1 and x = 1.
Solution The region whose area we want is shown in Figure 21. Notice the symmetry
of the graph. Also, half the region we are interested in is above the x-axis, while the other
half is below. If we calculated the integral 
 1
−1 xex2 dx, the result would be 
Area above x-axis −Area below x-axis = 0
which does not give us the total area. To prevent the area below the x-axis from being
combined with the area above the axis, we do the calculation in two parts, as illustrated
in Figure 22.
(In Figure 22 we broke the integral at x = 0 because that is where the graph crosses
the x-axis.) These integrals can be calculated using the substitution u = x2:

As a Geographic Information
Systems (GIS) Analyst for an
environmental consulting firm in
San Diego, I’m helping to create
a higher quality of life for South-
ern Californians. My company,
RECON Environmental, Inc. is
dedicated to balancing the de-
mands of industry and a growing
population with the hope of preserving our cultural landscape
and protecting our environment. My job is a combination of
cartography and information systems; I provide spatial sta-
tistics and geographic resources to archeologists and biolo-
gists. The data I provide are presented both as hard numbers
and graphically as maps and figures. These are presented in
documents such as Environmental Impact Reports.
GIS is a powerful tool used to answer spatial questions
that help manage our environment. Even though I’m not solv-
ing equations day to day, it is my responsibility to input the
correct variables and to know what to “tell” the GIS software
to do with the data. Without a background in calculus I would
not be able evaluate the computer’s output. My background in
applied mathematics allows me to understand the methodology
and to review my work by making sure the final data are in
fact realistic and accurate. This ensures a quality product to
my clients.
GIS can quickly calculate the area of a site and deter-
mine the distance to other geographic features such as bodies
of water, developed/urban areas, or competing habitats. Like
other information systems, GIS organizes and manipulates
information, but what makes GIS different is that all the data
it works with are spatially referenced—either by X- or Y- (and
sometimes Z-elevation) coordinates or in some cases a street
address. By assigning each record of a GIS database a coordi-
nate value—essentially representing everything in space with
numbers, analysts can then input these data into software
such as ArcGIS or ArcView that is capable of running rigorous
algorithms in order to calculate area and distance. This allows
us to understand the relationship of geographic features in a
less abstract, and more quantitative way, resulting in more
informed decisions about the way we manage our world.
In the end, my work—with the help of understanding ap-
plied mathematics—allows policy makers, city and regional
planners, and environmentally conscious individuals the abil-
ity to make intelligent and informed land use decisions that
increase the quality of life for all of us.

To obtain the total area, we should add the absolute values of these answers because we
don’t wish to count any area as negative. Thus,
Total area ≈0.85914 + 0.85914 = 1.71828.

The Integral
(So, for example, the wages increased 9.3% from 1981 to 1982.)
Getting to work, you decide that the ﬁrst thing to do is ﬁt these data to a mathemat-
ical curve that you can use to project future changes in wages. You graph the data to get
a sense of what mathematical models might be appropriate (Figure 1).

SUBJECT: Cost of labor
Yesterday, the CEO asked me to ﬁnd some mathematical formulas to estimate (1)
the trend in annual wage increases and (2) the average annual wage of assembly
line workers from the time they join the company to the time they retire. (She needs
the information for next week’s stockholder meeting.) So far, I have had very little
luck: All I have been able to ﬁnd is a table giving annual percentage wage increases
(attached). Also, I know that the average wage for an assembly-line worker in 1981
was $25,000 per year. Do you have any ideas?

You then ﬁnd the values of a and b that best ﬁt the given data.43 This gives you the

42 There is a good mathematical reason for choosing a curve of this form: it is a ﬁrst approximation (for t ≥1)
to a general rational function that approaches a constant as t →+∞.
43To do this, you note that y is a linear function of 1/t, namely, y = a(1/t) + b. Then you run a linear
regression on the data (1/t, y).

Now that you have a model for wage inﬂation, you must use it to ﬁnd the annual
wage. First, you realize that the model gives the fractional rate of increase of wages (be-
cause it is speciﬁed as a percentage, or fraction, of the total wage). In other words, if
w(t) represents a worker’s annual wage at time t, Then
y = dw/dt
w
= d
dt (ln w)
By the chain rule for derivatives.

You ﬁnd an equation for a worker’s annual wage at time t by solving for w:
ln w =

y dt
=
 a
t + b
	
dt
= a ln t + bt + C
where a and b are as above and C is the constant of integration, so
w = ea ln t+bt+C
To compute C, you substitute the initial data from the memo: w(1) = 25,000. Thus,
25,000 = ea ln 1+b+C = eb+C = e0.028647+C
Thus,
ln(25,000) = 0.028647 + C
which gives
C = ln(25,000) −0.028647 ≈10.098
(to 5 signiﬁcant digits).
Now you can write down the following formula for the annual wage of an assembly-line
worker as a function of t, the number of years since 1980:
w(t) = ea ln t+bt+C = e0.071813 ln t+0.028647t+10.098
= e0.071813 ln te0.028647te10.098
= t0.071813e0.028647te10.098
What remains is the calculation of the average annual wage. The average is the total
wage earned over the worker’s career divided by the number of years worked:
¯w =
1
s −r
 s
r
w(t) dt
where r is the time an employee begins working at the company and s is the time he or
she retires. Substituting the formula for w(t) gives

You cannot ﬁnd an explicit antiderivative for the integrand, so you decide that the only
way to compute it is numerically. You send the following memo to SC.

Example 5 Estimate the area under the graph of f (x) = 1 −x2 over the interval [0, 1] using n = 100, n = 200, and
n = 500 partitions.
Solution with Technology
There are several ways to compute Riemann sums with a graphing calculator. We illustrate
one method. For n = 100, we need to compute the sum
99

k=0
f (xk)x = [ f (0) + f (0.01) + · · · + f (0.99)](0.01)
See discussion in Example 5
Thus, we ﬁrst need to calculate the numbers f (0), f (0.01), and so on, and add them up. The TI-83/84 has a built-in sum
function (available in the LIST MATH menu), which, like the SUM function in a spreadsheet, sums the entries in a list.
1. To generate a list that contains the numbers we want to add together, use the seq function (available in the LIST OPS
menu). If we enter
seq(1-X^2,X,0,0.99,0.01)
seq: 
OPS 
the calculator will calculate a list by evaluating 1-X^2 for values of X from 0 to 0.99 in steps of 0.01.
2. To take the sum of all these numbers, we wrap the seq function in a call to sum:
sum(seq(1-X^2,X,0,0.99,0.01))
sum: 
MATH 
This gives the sum
f (0) + f (0.01) + · · · + f (0.99) = 67.165
3. To obtain the Riemann sum, we need to multiply this sum by x = 0.01, and we obtain the estimate of
67.165 ≈0.67165 for the Riemann sum:
We obtain the other Riemann sums similarly, as shown here:

One disadvantage of this method is that the TI-83/84 can generate and sum a list of at most 999 entries. The TI-83/84

1. Enter the values for the endpoints a and b, the number of subdivisions n, and the formula x = (b −a)/n:
2. Next, we compute all the x-values we might need in column A. Because the largest value of n that we will be using is
500, we will need a total of 501 values of x. Note that the value in each cell below A3 is obtained from the one above
by adding x.

Introduction
In the preceding chapter, we learned how to compute many integrals and saw some of
the applications of the integral. In this chapter, we look at some further techniques for
computing integrals and then at more applications of the integral. We also see how to ex-
tend the deﬁnition of the deﬁnite integral to include integrals over inﬁnite intervals, and
show how such integrals can be used for long-term forecasting. Finally, we introduce the
beautiful theory of differential equations and some of its numerous applications.
Integration by Parts
Integration by parts is an integration technique that comes from the product rule for
derivatives. The tabular method we present here has been around for some time and
makes integration by parts quite simple, particularly in problems where it has to be used
several times.1
We start with a little notation to simplify things while we introduce integration by
parts (we use this notation only in the next few pages). If u is a function, denote its de-
rivative by D(u) and an antiderivative by I (u). Thus, for example, if u = 2x2, then
D(u) = 4x
and
I (u) = 2x3
3
[If we wished, we could instead take I (u) = 2x3
3
+ 46, but we usually opt to take the
simplest antiderivative.]

1 The version of the tabular method we use was developed and taught to us by Dan Rosen at Hofstra University.
quick Example
Integration by Parts
If u and v are continuous functions of x, and u has a continuous derivative, then

u · v dx = u · I (v) −

D(u)I (v) dx
(The following will be discussed more fully in Example 1 below.)

x · ex dx = x I (ex) −

D(x)I (ex) dx
= xex −

1 · ex dx
= xex −ex + C
I (ex) = ex; D(x) = 1

ex dx = ex + C
As the Quick Example shows, although we could not immediately integrate u · v = x · ex,
we could easily integrate D(u)I (v) = 1 · ex = ex.

Derivation of Integration by Parts Formula
As we mentioned, the integration-by-parts formula comes from the product rule for
derivatives. We apply the product rule to the function uI (v):
D[u · I (v)] = D(u)I (v) + uD(I (v))
= D(u)I (v) + uv
because D(I (v)) is the derivative of an antiderivative of v, which is v. Integrating both
sides gives
u · I (v) =

D(u)I (v) dx +

uv dx
A simple rearrangement of the terms now gives us the integration-by-parts formula.
The integration-by-parts formula is easiest to use via the tabular method illustrated
in the following example, where we repeat the calculation we did in the Quick Example
above.
14.1 Integration by Parts
983
Example 1 Integration by Parts: Tabular Method
Calculate 

xex dx .
Solution First, the reason we need to use integration by parts to evaluate this integral
is that none of the other techniques of integration that we’ve talked about up to now will
help us. Furthermore, we cannot simply ﬁnd antiderivatives of x and ex and multiply
them together. [You should check that (x2/2)ex is not an antiderivative for xex.] How-
ever, as we saw above, this integral can be found by integration by parts. We want to ﬁnd
the integral of the product of x and ex. We must make a decision: Which function will
play the role of u and which will play the role of v in the integration-by-parts formula?
Because the derivative of x is just 1, differentiating makes it simpler, so we try letting x
be u and letting ex be v. We need to calculate D(u) and I (v), which we record in the fol-
lowing table.

1 · ex dx
Below x in the D column, we put D(x) = 1; below ex in the I column, we put
I (ex) = ex. The arrow at an angle connecting x and I (ex) reminds us that the product
x I (ex) will appear in the answer; the plus sign on the left of the table reminds us that it
is +x I (ex) that appears. The integral sign and the horizontal arrow connecting D(x)
and I (ex) remind us that the integral of the product D(x)I (ex) also appears in the an-
swer; the minus sign on the left reminds us that we need to subtract this integral. Com-
bining these two contributions, we get

xex dx = xex −

ex dx
The integral that appears on the right is much easier than the one we began with, so we
can complete the problem:

xex dx = xex −

ex dx = xex −ex + C
−−−−−→

This gives

xex dx = x2
2 ex −
 x2
2 ex dx
The integral on the right is harder than the one we started with, not easier! How do we
know beforehand which way to go? We don’t. We have to be willing to do a little trial
and error: We try it one way, and if it doesn’t make things simpler, we try it another way.
Remember, though, that the function we put in the I column must be one that we can
integrate. ■
984
Chapter 14
Further Integration Techniques and Applications of the Integral
+Before we go on... In Example 1, what if we had made the opposite decision and put
ex in the D column and x in the I column? Then we would have had the following table:
D
I
+
ex
x
−

ex −−−→x2/2
Example 2 Repeated Integration by Parts
Calculate 

x2e−x dx .
Solution Again, we have a product—the integrand is the product of x2 and e−x. Be-
cause differentiating x2 makes it simpler, we put it in the D column and get the follow-
ing table:
D
I
+
x2
e−x
−

2x −−−→−e−x
This table gives us

x2e−x dx = x2(−e−x) −

2x(−e−x) dx
The last integral is simpler than the one we started with, but it still involves a product.
It’s a good candidate for another integration by parts. The table we would use would start
with 2x in the D column and −e−x in the I column, which is exactly what we see in the
last row of the table we’ve already made. Therefore, we continue the process, elongating
the table above:
D
I
+
x2
e−x
−
2x
−e−x
+

2 −−−→e−x
−−−−−→
−−−−−→
−−−−−→
−−−−−→

(Notice how the signs on the left alternate. Here’s why: To compute −

2x(−e−x) dx
we use the negative of the following table:

D


0 −−−→−e−x
D
I
+
2x
−e−x
−

2 −−−→e−x
so we reverse all the signs.)
Now, we still have to compute an integral (the integral of the product of the func-
tions in the bottom row) to complete the computation. But why stop here? Let’s continue
the process one more step:
In the bottom line we see that all that is left to integrate is 0(−e−x) = 0. Since the in-
deﬁnite integral of 0 is C, we can read the answer from the table as

x2e−x dx = x2(−e−x) −2x(e−x) + 2(−e−x) + C
= −x2e−x −2xe−x −2e−x + C
= −e−x(x2 + 2x + 2) + C
In Example 2 we saw a technique that we can summarize as follows:
Integrating a Polynomial Times a Function
If one of the factors in the integrand is a polynomial and the other factor is a function
that can be integrated repeatedly, put the polynomial in the D column and keep differ-
entiating until you get zero. Then complete the I column to the same depth, and read off
the answer.
For practice, redo Example 1 using this technique.
It is not always the case that the integrand is a polynomial times something easy to
integrate, so we can’t always expect to end up with a zero in the D column. In that case
we hope that at some point we will be able to integrate the product of the functions in
the last row. Here are some examples.

FAQs
Whether to Use Integration by Parts, and What Goes 
in the D and I Columns
Q: Will integration by parts always work to integrate a product?
A: No. While integration by parts often works for products in which one factor is a
polynomial, it will almost never work in the examples of products we saw when discussing
substitution in Section 13.2. For example, although integration by parts can be used to compute

(x2 −x)e2x−1 dx (put x2 −x in the D column and e2x−1 in the I column), it cannot be used to
compute 

(2x −1)ex2−x dx (put u = x2 −x). Recognizing when to use integration by parts is
best learned by experience. ■
Q: When using integration by parts, which expression goes in the D column, and which in the
I column?
A: Although there is no general rule, the following guidelines are useful:
• To integrate a product in which one factor is a polynomial and the other can be integrated
several times, put the polynomial in the D column and the other factor in the I column. Then
differentiate the polynomial until you get zero.
• If one of the factors is a polynomial but the other factor cannot be integrated easily, put the
polynomial in the I column and the other factor in the D column. Stop when the product of the
functions in the bottom row can be integrated.
• If neither factor is a polynomial, put the factor that seems easier to integrate in the I column
and the other factor in the D column. Again, stop the table as soon as the product of the func-
tions in the bottom row can be integrated.
• If your method doesn’t work, try switching the functions in the D and I columns or try break-
ing the integrand into a product in a different way. If none of this works, maybe integration by
parts isn’t the technique to use on this problem. ■

14.2 Area Between Two Curves and Applications
As we saw in the preceding chapter, we can use the deﬁnite integral to calculate the area
between the graph of a function and the x-axis. With only a little more work, we can use
it to calculate the area between two graphs. Figure 1 shows the graphs of two functions,
f (x) and g(x), with f (x) ≥g(x) for every x in the interval [a, b].
To ﬁnd the shaded area between the graphs of the two functions, we use the follow-
ing formula:

between x = −1 and x = 1.

the graph of g in the interval [−1, 1], we have f (x) ≥g(x) for all x in [−1, 1]. There-

Q: Why does the formula for the area between two curves work?
A: Let’s go back once again to the general case illustrated in Figure 1, where we were given
two functions f and g with f(x) ≥g(x) for every x in the interval [a, b]. To avoid complicating
the argument by the fact that the graph of g, or f, or both, may dip below the x-axis in the
interval [a, b] (as occurs in Figure 1 and also in Example 1), we shift both graphs vertically
upward by adding a big enough constant M to lift them both above the x-axis in the interval
[a, b], as shown in Figure 3.

[ f (x) −g(x)]dx
which is the formula we gave originally. ■
So far, we’ve been assuming that f (x) ≥g(x), so that the graph of f never dips
below the graph of g and so the graphs cannot cross (although they can touch). Exam-
ple 2 shows what happens when the two graphs do cross.

Example 2 Regions Enclosed by Crossing Curves
Find the area of the region between y = 3x2 and y = 1 −x2 and between x = 0 and
x = 1.
Solution The area we wish to calculate is shown in Figure 5. From the ﬁgure, we can
see that neither graph lies above the other over the whole interval. To get around this, we
break the area into the two pieces on either side of the point at which the graphs cross
and then compute each area separately. To do this, we need to know exactly where that
crossing point is. The crossing point is where 3x2 = 1 −x2, so we solve for x:
3x2 = 1 −x2
4x2 = 1
x2 = 1
4
x = ±1
2
Because we are interested only in the interval [0, 1], the crossing point we’re interested
in is at x = 1/2.
Now, to compute the areas A and B, we need to know which graph is on top in each
of these areas. We can see that from the ﬁgure, but what if the functions were more com-
plicated and we could not easily draw the graphs? To be sure, we can test the values of
the two functions at some point in each region. But we really need not worry. If we make
the wrong choice for the top function, the integral will yield the negative of the area
(why?), so we can simply take the absolute value of the integral to get the area of the
region in question. For this example, we have
A =

Further Integration Techniques and Applications of the Integral
Finding the Area Between the Graphs of f(x) and g(x)
1. Find all points of intersection by solving f (x) = g(x) for x. This either determines
the interval over which you will integrate or breaks up a given interval into regions
between the intersection points.
2. Determine the area of each region you found by integrating the difference of the
larger and the smaller function. (If you accidentally take the smaller minus the larger,
the integral will give the negative of the area, so just take the absolute value.)
3. Add together the areas you found in Step 2 to get the total area.
Example 3 The Area Enclosed by Two Curves
Find the area enclosed by y = x2 and y = x3.
Solution This example has a new wrinkle: we are not told what interval to use for x.
However, if we look at the graph in Figure 6, we see that the question can have only one
meaning.
We are being asked to ﬁnd the area of the shaded sliver, which is the only region that
is actually enclosed by the two graphs. This sliver is bounded on either side by the two
points where the graphs cross, so our ﬁrst task is to ﬁnd those points. They are the points
where x2 = x3, so we solve for x:
x2 = x3
x3 −x2 = 0
x2(x −1) = 0
x = 0
or
x = 1
Thus, we must integrate over the interval [0, 1]. Although we see from the diagram (or
by substituting x = 1/2) that the graph of y = x2 is above that of y = x3, if we didn’t
notice that we might calculate

This tells us that the required area is 1/12 square units and also that we had our integral
reversed. Had we calculated 
 1
0 (x2 −x3) dx instead, we would have found the correct
answer, 1/12, directly.
+Before we go on... What would have happened in Example 2 if we had not broken the
area into two pieces but had just calculated the integral of the difference of the two func-
tions? We would have calculated

Q: Is there any quick and easy method to find the area between two graphs without having
to find all points of intersection? What if it is hard or impossible to find out where the curves
intersect?
A: We can use technology to give the approximate area between two graphs. First recall that,
if f(x) ≥g(x) for all x in [a, b], then the area between their graphs over [a, b] is given by
 b
a [ f(x) −g(x)]dx, whereas if g(x) ≥f(x), the area is given by 
 b
a [g(x) −f(x)]dx. Notice that
both expressions are equal to
 b
a
| f (x) −g(x)| dx
telling us that we can use the same formula in both cases:

Averages and Moving Averages
Averages
To ﬁnd the average of, say, 20 numbers, we simply add them up and divide by 20. More
generally, if we want to ﬁnd the average, or mean, of the n numbers y1, y2, y3, . . . , yn,
we add them up and divide by n. We write this average as ¯y (“y-bar”).
quick Example
Average, or Mean, of a Collection of Values
¯y = y1 + y2 + · · · + yn
n
The average of {0, 2, −1, 5} is ¯y = 0 + 2 −1 + 5
4
= 6
4 = 1.5
But, we also use the word average in other senses. For example, we speak of the
average speed of a car during a trip.
Example 1 Average Speed
Over the course of 2 hours, my speed varied from 50 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour,
following the function v(t) = 50 + 2.5t2, 0 ≤t ≤2. What was my average speed over
those two hours?

14.3 Averages and Moving Averages

Solution Recall that average speed is simply the total distance traveled divided by the
time it took. Recall, also, that we can ﬁnd the distance traveled by integrating the speed:

In general, if we travel with velocity v(t) from time t = a to time t = b, we will
travel a distance of 
 b
a v(t) dt in time b −a, which gives an average velocity of
Average velocity =

Thinking of this calculation as ﬁnding the average value of the velocity function, we
generalize and make the following deﬁnition:

Interpreting the Average of a Function Geometrically
The average of a function has a geometric interpretation. Referring to the Quick Exam-

interval [1, 5] (Figure 7).

We can ﬁnd the area under the graph of f (x) = x by geometry or by calculus; it is
12. The area in the rectangle under y = 3 is also 12.
In general, the average ¯f of a positive function over the interval [a, b] gives the
height of the rectangle over the interval [a, b] that has the same area as the area under
the graph of f (x) as illustrated in Figure 8. The equality of these areas follows from the

Example 2 Average Balance
A savings account at the People’s Credit Union pays 3% interest, compounded continu-
ously, and at the end of the year you get a bonus of 1% of the average balance in the
account during the year. If you deposit $10,000 at the beginning of the year, how much
interest and how large a bonus will you get?
Solution We can use the continuous compound interest formula to calculate the amount
of money you have in the account at time t:
A(t) = 10,000e0.03t
where t is measured in years. At the end of 1 year, the account will have
A(1) = $10,304.55
so you will have earned $304.55 interest. To compute the bonus, we need to ﬁnd the
average amount in the account, which is the average of A(t) over the interval [0, 1].

The bonus is 1% of this, or $101.52.
+Before we go on... The 1% bonus in Example 2 was one-third of the total interest. Why
did this happen? What fraction of the total interest would the bonus be if the interest rate
was 4%, 5%, or 10%? ■
Moving Averages
Suppose you follow the performance of a company’s stock by recording the daily clos-
ing prices. The graph of these prices may seem jagged or “jittery” due to random day-
to-day ﬂuctuations. To see any trends, you would like a way to “smooth out” these data.
The moving average is one common way to do that.

The closing stock prices and moving averages are plotted in Figure 9.

Solution The 5-day moving average is the average of each day’s price together with the
prices of the preceding 4 days. We can compute the 5-day moving averages starting on
the ﬁfth day. We get these numbers:

Stock price
Moving average
Figure 9
As you can see, the moving average is less volatile than the closing price. Because
the moving average incorporates the stock’s performance over 5 days at a time, a single
day’s ﬂuctuation is smoothed out. Look at day 9 in particular. The moving average also
tends to lag behind the actual performance because it takes past history into account.
Look at the downturns at days 6 and 18 in particular.
The period of 5 days for a moving average, as used in Example 3, is arbitrary. Using
a longer period of time would smooth the data more but increase the lag. For data used
as economic indicators, such as housing prices or retail sales, it is common to compute
the 4-quarter moving average to smooth out seasonal variations.
using Technology
We can automate these compu-
tations using a graphing calcula-
tor or Excel. See the Technology
Guides at the end of the chapter
to ﬁnd out how to tabulate and
graph moving averages.

It is also sometimes useful to compute moving averages of continuous functions.
We may want to do this if we use a mathematical model of a large collection of data.
Also, some physical systems have the effect of converting an input function (an electri-
cal signal, for example) into its moving average. By an n-unit moving average of a
function f (x) we mean the function ¯f for which ¯f (x) is the average of the value of
f (x) on [x −n, x]. Using the formula for the average of a function, we get the follow-
ing formula.

Solution This function is a little tricky to integrate analytically because |x| is deﬁned
differently for positive and negative values of x, so instead we use technology to

14.4 Applications to Business and Economics:
Consumers’ and Producers’ Surplus and
Continuous Income Streams 
(OPTIONAL)
Consumers’ Surplus 
Consider a general demand curve presented, as is traditional in economics, as p = D(q),
where p is unit price and q is demand measured, say, in annual sales (Figure 12). Thus,
D(q) is the price at which the demand will be q units per year. The price p0 shown on
the graph is the highest price that customers are willing to pay.
Suppose, for example, that the graph is the demand curve for a particular new
model of computer. When the computer ﬁrst comes out and supplies are low (q is small),
“early adopters” will be willing to pay a high price. This is the part of the graph on the
left, near the p axis. As supplies increase and the price drops, more consumers will be
willing to pay and more computers will be sold. We can ask the following question: How
much are consumers willing to spend for the ﬁrst ¯q units?
Consumers’ Willingness to Spend
We can approximate consumers’ willingness to spend on the ﬁrst ¯q units as follows. We
partition the interval [0, ¯q ] into n subintervals of equal length, as we did when dis-
cussing Riemann sums. Figure 13 shows a typical subinterval, [qk−1, qk].
The price consumers are willing to pay for each of units qk−1 through qk is approxi-
mately D(qk−1), so the total that consumers are willing to spend for these units is approxi-
mately D(qk−1)(qk −qk−1) = D(qk−1)q, the area of the shaded region in Figure 13.
Thus, the total amount that consumers are willing to spend for items 0 through ¯q is
W ≈D(q0)q + D(q1)q + · · · + D(qn−1)q =
n−1
	
k=0
D(qk)q
which is a Riemann sum. The approximation becomes better the larger n becomes, and
in the limit the Riemann sums converge to the integral
W =
 ¯q
0
D(q) dq
This quantity, the area shaded in Figure 14, is the total consumers’ willingness to spend
to buy the ﬁrst ¯q units.
Consumers’ Expenditure
Now suppose that the manufacturer simply sets the price at ¯p, with a corresponding
demand of ¯q, so D( ¯q) = ¯p. Then the amount that consumers will actually spend to buy
these ¯q is ¯p ¯q, the product of the unit price and the quantity sold. This is the area of the
rectangle shown in Figure 15. Notice that we can write ¯p ¯q =
 ¯q
0
¯p dq, as suggested by
the ﬁgure.
The difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually
pay is money in their pockets and is called the consumers’ surplus.

14.4 Applications to Business and Economics: Consumers’ and Producers’ Surplus and Continuous Income Streams (OPTIONAL)
1005
Consumers’ Surplus
If demand for an item is given by p = D(q), the selling price is ¯p, and ¯q is the corre-
sponding demand [so that D( ¯q) = ¯p ], then the consumers’ surplus is the difference
between their willingness to spend and their actual expenditure:

Example 1 Consumers’ Surplus
Your used-CD store has an exponential demand equation of the form
p = 15e−0.01q
where q represents daily sales of used CDs and p is the price you charge per CD. Calcu-
late the daily consumers’ surplus if you sell your used CDs at $5 each.
Solution We are given D(q) = 15e−0.01q and ¯p = 5. We also need ¯q. By deﬁnition,
D( ¯q) = ¯p
or
15e−0.01¯q = 5
which we must solve for ¯q:

Producers’ Surplus
We can also calculate extra income earned by producers. Consider a supply equation of
the form p = S(q), where S(q) is the price at which a supplier is willing to supply q
items (per time period). Because a producer is generally willing to supply more units
at a higher price per unit, a supply curve usually has a positive slope, as shown in
Figure 16. The price p0 is the lowest price that a producer is willing to charge. 
Arguing as before, we see that the minimum amount of money producers are will-
ing to receive in exchange for ¯q items is 
 ¯q
0 S(q) dq. On the other hand, if the producers
charge ¯p per item for ¯q items, their actual revenue is ¯p ¯q =
 ¯q
0 ¯p dq.
The difference between the producers’actual revenue and the minimum they would
have been willing to receive is the producers’ surplus.

Example 2 Producers’ Surplus
My tie-dye T-shirt enterprise has grown to the extent that I am now able to produce 
T-shirts in bulk, and several campus groups have begun placing orders. I have informed
one group that I am prepared to supply 20√p −4 T-shirts at a price of p dollars per
shirt. What is my total surplus if I sell T-shirts to the group at $8 each?
Solution We need to calculate the producers’surplus when ¯p = 8. The supply equation is
q = 20

p −4
but in order to use the formula for producers’surplus, we need to express p as a function
of q. First, we square both sides to remove the radical sign:
q2 = 400( p −4)
so
p −4 = q2
400
giving

Thus, I earn a surplus of $106.67 if I sell T-shirts to the group at $8 each.
Example 3 Equilibrium
To continue the preceding example: A representative informs me that the campus group
is prepared to order only 

200(16 −p) T-shirts at p dollars each. I would like to pro-
duce as many T-shirts for them as possible but avoid being left with unsold T-shirts.
Given the supply curve from the preceding example, what price should I charge per 
T-shirt, and what are the consumers’ and producers’ surpluses at that price?
Solution The price that guarantees neither a shortage nor a surplus of T-shirts is the
equilibrium price, the price where supply equals demand. We have
Supply:
q = 20

p −4
Demand:
q =

200(16 −p)
Equating these gives
20

p −4 =

200(16 −p)
400( p −4) = 200(16 −p)
400p −1600 = 3200 −200p
600p = 4800
p = $8 per T-shirt
We therefore take ¯p = 8 (which happens to be the price we used in the preceding ex-
ample). We get the corresponding value for q by substituting p = 8 into either the de-
mand or supply equation:
¯q = 20
√
8 −4 = 40
Thus, ¯p = 8 and ¯q = 40.

Further Integration Techniques and Applications of the Integral
We must now calculate the consumers’ surplus and the producers’ surplus. We cal-
culated the producers’ surplus for ¯p = 8 in the preceding example:
PS = $106.67
For the consumers’ surplus, we must ﬁrst express p as a function of q for the de-
mand equation. Thus, we solve the demand equation for p as we did for the supply equa-
tion and we obtain

pockets is a Good Thing, the total of the consumers’ and the producers’ surpluses is
called the total social gain. In this case it is

Continuous Income Streams
For purposes of calculation, it is often convenient to assume that a company with a high
sales volume receives money continuously. In such a case, we have a function R(t) that
represents the rate at which money is being received by the company at time t.

Example 4 Continuous Income
An ice cream store’s business peaks in late summer; the store’s summer revenue is ap-
proximated by
R(t) = 300 + 4.5t −0.05t2 dollars per day
(0 ≤t ≤92)
where t is measured in days after June 1. What is its total revenue for the months of June,
July, and August?
Photodisc/Getty Images

Solution Let’s approximate the total revenue by breaking up the interval [0, 92] repre-
senting the three months into n subintervals [tk−1, tk], each with length t. In the inter-
val [tk−1, tk] the store receives money at a rate of approximately R(tk−1) dollars per day
for t days, so it will receive a total of R(tk−1)t dollars. Over the whole summer, then,
the store will receive approximately
R(t0)t + R(t1)t + · · · + R(tn−1)t dollars
As we let n become large to better approximate the total revenue, this Riemann sum
approaches the integral

Cooper, I use mathematics when I perform financial analysis
on companies in financial distress and/or bankruptcy.
At a large merchant power company we built a highly
complex mathematical model to analyze the financial capa-
bilities of the corporation and to project the company’s finan-
cial performance into the future. The model was used by the
company to forecast performance and by the lenders, in-
vestors and other key stakeholders to determine whether or
not to lend money, invest and/or partner with the company.
At a major jewelry manufacturer, we determined that
the company was losing money on most of its smaller orders.
We used our mathematical analysis to work with the com-
pany to eliminate a series of costly activities that were unim-
portant to the smaller customers, determined the true cost of
handling smaller orders, revised their computer pricing mod-
els, improved the company’s pricing, and created incentives
for customers to place larger orders. Almost immediately our
financial analysis resulted in higher profitability for the de-
partment and higher overall sales results.
While these are just a few examples, the bulk of the work
performed in the financial world has its basis in the same

Generalizing Example 4, we can say the following:

If the rate of receipt of income is R(t) dollars per unit of time, then the total income re-
ceived from time t = a to t = b is
Total value = T V =
 b
a

Future Value of a Continuous Income Stream
If the rate of receipt of income from time t = a to t = b is R(t) dollars per unit of time
and the income is deposited as it is received in an account paying interest at rate r per
Example 5 Future Value
Suppose the ice cream store in the preceding example deposits its receipts in an account
paying 5% interest per year compounded continuously. How much money will it have in
its account at the end of August?
Solution Now we have to take into account not only the revenue but also the interest it
earns in the account. Again, we break the interval [0, 92] into n subintervals. During the
interval [tk−1, tk], approximately R(tk−1)t dollars are deposited in the account. That
money will earn interest until the end of August, a period of 92 −tk−1 days, or
(92 −tk−1)/365 years. The formula for continuous compounding tells us that by the end
of August, those R(tk−1)t dollars will have turned into
R(tk−1)te0.05(92−tk−1)/365 = R(tk−1)e0.05(92−tk−1)/365t dollars
(Recall that 5% is the annual interest rate.) Adding up the contributions from each subin-
terval, we see that the total in the account at the end of August will be approximately
R(t0)e0.05(92−t0)/365t + R(t1)e0.05(92−t1)/365t + · · · + R(tn−1)e0.05(92−tn−1)/365t
This is a Riemann sum; as n gets large the sum approaches the integral
Future value = FV =

R(t)e0.05(92−t)/365 dt
Substituting R(t) = 300 + 4.5t −0.05t2, we obtain

(300 + 4.5t −0.05t2)e0.05(92−t)/365 dt

Using technology or integration by parts
+Before we go on... The interest earned in the account in Example 5 was fairly small
(compare this answer to that in Example 4). Not only was the money in the account for
only three months, but much of it was put in the account towards the end of that period,
so had very little time to earn interest. ■

Example 6 Present Value
You are thinking of buying the ice cream store discussed in the preceding two examples.
What is its income stream worth to you on June 1? Assume that you have access to the
same account paying 5% per year compounded continuously.
Solution The value of the income stream on June 1 is the amount of money that, if
deposited June 1, would give you the same future value as the income stream will. If we
let PV denote this “present value,” its value after 92 days will be
PVe0.05×92/365
We equate this with the future value of the income stream to get
PVe0.05×92/365 =
 92
0
R(t)e0.05(92−t)/365 dt
so
PV =
 92
0
R(t)e−0.05t/365 dt
Substituting the formula for R(t) and integrating using technology or integration by
parts, we get
PV ≈$33,455
The general formula is the following:
Present Value of a Continuous Income Stream
If the rate of receipt of income from time t = a to t = b is R(t) dollars per unit of time
and the income is deposited as it is received in an account paying interest at rate r per unit
of time, compounded continuously, then the value of the income stream at time t = a is
Present value = PV =
 b
a
R(t)er(a−t)dt
We can derive this formula from the relation
FV = PVer(b−a)
because the present value is the amount that would have to be deposited at time t = a to
give a future value of FV at time t = b.
Note These formulas are more general than we’ve said. They still work when R(t) < 0
if we interpret negative values as money ﬂowing out rather than in. That is, we can use
these formulas for income we receive or for payments that we make, or for situations

where we sometimes receive money and sometimes pay it out. These formulas can also
be used for ﬂows of quantities other than money. For example, if we use an exponential
model for population growth and we let R(t) represent the rate of immigration
[R(t) > 0] or emigration [R(t) < 0], then the future value formula gives the future
population. ■

Q: We learned that the integral can be interpreted as the area under the curve. Is this still true
for improper integrals?
A: Yes. Figure 18 illustrates how we can represent an improper integral as the area of an
infinite region.

Q: Wait! We calculated

dx/x2 = 1. Does this mean that the infinitely long area in Figure 18
has an area of only 1 square unit?
A: That is exactly what it means. If you had enough paint to cover 1 square unit, you would
never run out of paint while painting the region in Figure 18. This is one of the places where
mathematics seems to contradict common sense. But common sense is notoriously unreliable
when dealing with infinities. ■
Example 1 Future Sales of VCRs
In 2001, sales of DVD players were starting to make inroads into the sales of VCRs, but
VCRs were still selling well.* Approximately 15 million VCRs were expected to be sold
in 2001. Suppose that sales of VCRs decrease by 15% per year from 2001 on. How
many VCRs, total, will be sold from 2001 on?
Solution Recall that the total sales between two dates can be computed as the deﬁnite
integral of annual sales. So, if we wanted the sales between the year 2001 and a year far
in the future, we would compute 
 M
0 s(t) dt with a large M, where s(t) is the annual
sales t years after 2001. Because we want to know the total number of VCRs sold from
2001 on, we let M →+∞; that is, we compute 
 +∞
0
s(t) dt.
Because sales of VCRs are decreasing by 15% per year, we can model s(t) by
s(t) = 15(0.85)t million VCRs
where t is the number of years since 2001.

Integrals in Which the Integrand Becomes Infinite
We can sometimes compute integrals 
 b
a f (x) dx in which f (x) becomes inﬁnite. As
we’ll see in Example 4, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus does not work for such
integrals. The ﬁrst case to consider is when f (x) approaches ±∞at either a or b.
Example 2 Integrand Infinite at One Endpoint
Calculate
 1
0
1
√x dx.
Solution Notice that the integrand approaches +∞as x approaches 0 from the right
and is not deﬁned at 0. This makes the integral an improper integral. Figure 19 shows the
region whose area we are trying to calculate; it extends inﬁnitely vertically rather than
horizontally.
Now, if 0 < r < 1, the integral 
 1
r (1/√x) dx is a proper integral because we avoid
the bad behavior at 0. This integral gives the area shown in Figure 20. If we let r
approach 0 from the right, the area in Figure 20 will approach the area in Figure 19. So,
we calculate
 1

√x dx = lim
r→0+
 1
r

√x dx
= lim
r→0+[2√x]1

Thus, we again have an inﬁnitely long region with ﬁnite area.

Improper Integral in Which the Integrand Becomes Infinite
If f (x) is deﬁned for all x with a < x ≤b but approaches ±∞as x approaches a, we
deﬁne
 b
a
f (x) dx = lim
r→a+
 b
r

provided the limit exists. Similarly, if f (x) is deﬁned for all x with a ≤x < b but
approaches ±∞as x approaches b, we deﬁne
 b
a
f (x) dx = lim
r→b−
 r

provided the limit exists. In either case, if the limit exists, we say that 
 b
a f (x) dx
converges. Otherwise, we say that 
 b
a f (x) dx diverges.
Generalizing, we make the following deﬁnition.

Example 3 Testing for Convergence
Does 
 3
−1
x
x2 −9 dx converge? If so, to what?
Solution We ﬁrst check to see where, if anywhere, the integrand approaches ±∞. That
will happen where the denominator becomes 0, so we solve x2 −9 = 0.
x2 −9 = 0
x2 = 9
x = ±3
The solution x = −3 is outside of the range of integration, so we ignore it. The solution
x = 3 is, however, the right endpoint of the range of integration, so the integral is im-
proper. We need to investigate the following limit:
 3
−1
x
x2 −9 dx = lim
r→3−
 r
−1
x
x2 −9 dx
Now, to calculate the integral we use a substitution:
Thus,
 r
−1
x
x2 −9 dx =
 r2−9
−8
1
2u du
= 1
2[ln |u|]r2−9
−8
= 1
2 (ln |r2 −9| −ln 8)
Now we take the limit:
 3
−1
x
x2 −9 dx = lim
r→3−
 r
−1
x
x2 −9 dx
= lim
r→3−
1
2 (ln |r2 −9| −ln 8)
= −∞
because, as r →3, r2 −9 →0, and so ln |r2 −9| →−∞. Thus, this integral diverges.
u = x2 −9
du
dx = 2x
dx = 1
2x du
when x = r, u = r2 −9
when x = −1, u = (−1)2 −9 = −8

We end with an example of what to do if an integral is improper for more than one
reason.

Example 4 Integrand Infinite Between the Endpoints
Does 
 3
−2
1
x2 dx converge? If so, to what?
Solution Again we check to see if there are any points at which the integrand ap-
proaches ±∞. There is such a point, at x = 0. This is between the endpoints of the range
of integration. To deal with this we break the integral into two integrals:
 3
−2
1
x2 dx =
 0
−2
1
x2 dx +
 3
0
1

Each integral on the right is an improper integral with the integrand approaching ±∞at
an endpoint. If both of the integrals on the right converge, we take the sum as the value
of the integral on the left. So now we compute

which diverges to +∞. There is no need now to check 
 3
0 (1/x2) dx; because one of the
two pieces of the integral diverges, we simply say that 
 3
−2(1/x2) dx diverges.
+Before we go on... What if we had been sloppy in Example 4 and had not checked ﬁrst
whether the integrand approached ±∞somewhere? Then we probably would have ap-
plied the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and done the following:

WRONG!
Notice that the answer this “calculation” gives is patently ridiculous. Because 1/x2 > 0
for all x for which it is deﬁned, any deﬁnite integral of 1/x2 must give a positive answer.
Moral: Always check to see whether the integrand blows up anywhere in the range of
integration. If it does, the FTC does not apply, and we must use the methods of this
example. ■

Differential Equations and Applications
A differential equation is an equation that involves a derivative of an unknown
function. A ﬁrst-order differential equation involves only the ﬁrst derivative of the un-
known function. A second-order differential equation involves the second derivative
of the unknown function (and possibly the ﬁrst derivative). Higher-order differential
equations are deﬁned similarly. In this book, we will deal only with ﬁrst-order differen-
tial equations.
To solve a differential equation means to ﬁnd the unknown function. Many of the
laws of science and other ﬁelds describe how things change. When expressed mathe-
matically, these laws take the form of equations involving derivatives—that is, differen-
tial equations. The ﬁeld of differential equations is a large and very active area of study
in mathematics, and we shall see only a small part of it in this section.
Example 1 Motion
A dragster accelerates from a stop so that its speed t seconds after starting is 40t ft/s.
How far will the car go in 8 seconds?

1024
Chapter 14
Further Integration Techniques and Applications of the Integral
Solution We wish to ﬁnd the car’s position function s(t). We are told about its speed,
which is ds/dt. Precisely, we are told that
ds
dt = 40t
This is the differential equation we have to solve to ﬁnd s(t). But we already know how
to solve this kind of differential equation; we integrate:
s(t) =

40t dt = 20t2 + C
We now have the general solution to the differential equation. By letting C take on dif-
ferent values, we get all the possible solutions. We can specify the one particular solu-
tion that gives the answer to our problem by imposing the initial condition that
s(0) = 0. Substituting into s(t) = 20t2 + C, we get
0 = s(0) = 20(0)2 + C = C
so C = 0 and s(t) = 20t2. To answer the question, the car travels 20(8)2 = 1280 feet in
8 seconds.
We did not have to work hard to solve the differential equation in Example 1. In
fact, any differential equation of the form dy/dx = f (x) can (in theory) be solved by
integrating. (Whether we can actually carry out the integration is another matter!)

Not all differential equations are simple, as the next example shows.

14.6 Differential Equations and Applications
1025
Solution
a. This is not a simple differential equation because the right-hand side is a function of
both x and y. We cannot solve this equation by just integrating; the solution to this
problem is to “separate” the variables.
Step 1 Separate the variables algebraically. We rewrite the equation as
y2 dy = x dx
Step 2 Integrate both sides.

y2 dy =

x dx
giving
y3
3 = x2
2 + C
Step 3 Solve for the dependent variable. We solve for y:
y3 = 3
2x2 + 3C = 3
2x2 + D
(rewriting 3C as D, an equally arbitrary constant), so
y =
3
2x2 + D
1/3
This is the general solution of the differential equation.
b. We now need to ﬁnd the value for D that will give us the solution satisfying the con-
dition y(0) = 2. Substituting 0 for x and 2 for y in the general solution, we get
2 =
3
2(0)2 + D
1/3
= D1/3
so
D = 23 = 8
Thus, the particular solution we are looking for is

Q: In Example 2, we wrote y2 dy and x dx. What do they mean?
A: Although it is possible to give meaning to these symbols, for us they are just a notational
convenience. We could have done the following instead:
y2 dy
dx = x
Now we integrate both sides with respect to x.

y2 dy

We can use substitution to rewrite the left-hand side:

Example 3 Rising Medical Costs
Spending on Medicare from 2000 to 2025 was projected to rise continuously at an in-
stantaneous rate of 3.7% per year.* Find a formula for Medicare spending y as a function
of time t in years since 2000.
Solution When we say that Medicare spending y was going up continuously at an
instantaneous rate of 3.7% per year, we mean that
the instantaneous rate of increase of y was 3.7% of its value

This is a separable differential equation. Separating the variables gives
1
y dy = 0.037 dt
Integrating both sides, we get
 1
y dy =

0.037 dt
so
ln y = 0.037t + C
(We should write ln |y|, but we know that the medical costs are positive.) We now solve
for y.
y = e0.037t+C = eCe0.037t = Ae0.037t
where A is a positive constant. This is the formula we used before for continuous per-
centage growth.
+Before we go on... To determine A in Example 3 we need to know, for example,
Medicare spending at time t = 0. The source cited estimates Medicare spending as
$239.6 billion in 2000. Substituting t = 0 in the equation above gives
239.6 = Ae0 = A
Thus, projected Medicare spending is
y = 239.6e0.037t billion dollars
t years after 2000. ■
Example 4 Newton’s Law of Cooling
Newton’s Law of Cooling states that a hot object cools at a rate proportional to the dif-
ference between its temperature and the temperature of the surrounding environment
(the ambient temperature). If a hot cup of coffee, at 170°F, is left to sit in a room at
70°F, how will the temperature of the coffee change over time?
Solution We let H(t) denote the temperature of the coffee at time t. Newton’s Law of
Cooling tells us that H(t) decreases at a rate proportional to the difference between
H(t) and 70°F, the ambient temperature. In other words,
dH
dt = −k(H −70)
where k is some positive constant.* Note that H ≥70: The coffee will never cool to less
than the ambient temperature.
* When we say that a quantity Q is proportional to a quantity R, we mean that Q = kR for some constant k.
The constant k is referred to as the constant of proportionality.

The variables here are H and t, which we can separate as follows:
dH
H −70 = −k dt
Integrating, we get

dH
H −70 =

(−k) dt
so
ln(H −70) = −kt + C
(Note that H −70 is positive, so we don’t need absolute values.) We now solve for H:
H −70 = e−kt+C
= eCe−kt
= Ae−kt
so
H(t) = 70 + Ae−kt
where A is some positive constant. We can determine the constant A using the initial
condition H(0) = 170:
170 = 70 + Ae0 = 70 + A
so
A = 100
Therefore,
H(t) = 70 + 100e−kt
Q: But what is k?
A: The constant k determines the rate of cooling. Its value depends on the units of time we are
using, on the substance cooling—in this case the coffee—and its container. Figure 21 shows two
possible graphs, one with k = 0.1 and the other with k = 0.03 (k ≈0.03 for a cup of coffee in a
Styrofoam container with t measured in minutes).
In any case, we can see from the graph or the formula for H (t) that the temperature of
the coffee will approach the ambient temperature exponentially. ■

Law of Cooling: The rate of change of temperature is propor-
tional to the difference between the temperature of an object

equation for your total sales (as a function of the month) and
solve. (What are your total sales at the moment when you ﬁrst
introduce the monitor?)

ing that monthly sales will be 5% of the difference between

27. Approach to Equilibrium The Extrasoft Toy Co. has just re-

dolls per month when the price is p dollars. The supply func-
tion is S( p) = 30,000 + 500p dolls per month when the price
is p dollars. This makes the equilibrium price $20. The Evans
price adjustment model assumes that if the price is set at a
value other than the equilibrium price, it will change over
time in such a way that its rate of change is proportional to the
shortage D( p) −S( p).

sprockets per year when the price is p dollars.

preceding exercise, write the differential equation for the
price p(t) as a function of time.

CA S E  ST U DY:
Estimating Tax Revenues
You have just been hired by the incoming administra-
tion of your country as chief consultant for national
tax policy, and you have been getting conﬂicting ad-
vice from the ﬁnance experts on your staff. Several of
them have come up with plausible suggestions for new
tax structures, and your job is to choose the plan that
results in more revenue for the government.
Before you can evaluate their plans, you realize that
it is essential to know your country’s income distribu-
tion—that is, how many people earn how much
money.37 One might think that the most useful way of specifying income distribution
would be to use a function that gives the exact number f (x) of people who earn a given
salary x. This would necessarily be a discrete function—it only makes sense if x happens
to be a whole number of cents. There is, after all, no one earning a salary of exactly
$22,000.142567! Furthermore, this function would behave rather erratically, because
there are, for example, probably many more people making a salary of exactly $30,000
than exactly $30,000.01. Given these problems, it is far more convenient to start with the
function deﬁned by
N(x) = the total number of people earning between 0 and x dollars
Actually, you would want a “smoothed” version of this function. The graph of N(x)
might look like the one shown in Figure 22.

Figure 23
37 To simplify our discussion, we are assuming that (1) all tax revenues are based on earned income and that
(2) everyone in the population we consider earns some income.
38 A very similar idea is used in probability. See the optional chapter on Calculus Applied to Probability and
Statistics at the website.
If we take the derivative of N(x), we get an income distribution function. Its graph
might look like the one shown in Figure 23. Because the derivative measures the rate of
change, its value at x is the additional number of taxpayers per $1 increase in salary.
Thus, the fact that N ′(20,000) ≈5500 tells us that approximately 5500 people are earn-
ing a salary of between $20,000 and $20,001. In other words, N ′ shows the distribution
of incomes among the population—hence, the name “distribution function.”38
You thus send a memo to your experts requesting the income distribution function
for the nation. After much collection of data, they tell you that the income distribution

Further Integration Techniques and Applications of the Integral
function is
N ′(x) = 7000e−(x−30,000)2/400,000,000
This is in fact the function whose graph is shown in Figure 23 and is an example of
a normal distribution. Notice that the curve is symmetric around the median income
of $30,000 and that about 7000 people are earning between $30,000 and $30,001
annually.39
Given this income distribution, your ﬁnancial experts have come up with the two
possible tax policies illustrated in Figures 24 and 25.

Annual Income Tax
Figure 25
In the ﬁrst alternative, all taxpayers pay half of their income in taxes, except that no
one pays more than $40,000 in taxes. In the second alternative, there are four tax brack-
ets, described by the following table:
39 You might ﬁnd it odd that you weren’t given the original function N, but it will turn out that you don’t need
it. How would you compute it?
Income

0%
$20,000–60,000
50%
$60,000–80,000
200%
Above $80,000
0%
Now you must determine which alternative will generate more annual tax revenue.
Each of Figures 24 and 25 is the graph of a function, T. Rather than using the for-
mulas for these particular functions, you begin by working with the general situation.
You have an income distribution function N ′ and a tax function T, both functions of an-
nual income. You need to ﬁnd a formula for total tax revenues. First you decide to use a
cutoff so that you need to work only with incomes in some ﬁnite bracket [0, M]; you
might use, for example, M = $10 million (later you will let M approach +∞). Next
you subdivide the interval [0, M] into a large number of intervals of small width, x. If
[xk−1, xk] is a typical such interval, you wish to calculate the approximate tax revenue
from people whose total incomes lie between xk−1 and xk. You will then sum over k to
get the total revenue.
You need to know how many people are making incomes between xk−1 and xk.
Because N(xk) people are making incomes up to xk and N(xk−1) people are making

incomes up to xk−1, the number of people making incomes between xk−1 and xk is
N(xk) −N(xk−1). Because xk is very close to xk−1, the incomes of these people are all
approximately equal to xk−1 dollars, so each of these taxpayers is paying an annual tax
of about T(xk−1). This gives a tax revenue of 
[N(xk) −N(xk−1)]T(xk−1)
Now you do a clever thing. You write xk −xk−1 = x and replace N(xk) −N(xk−1) by
N(xk) −N(xk−1)
x
x
This gives you a tax revenue of about
N(xk) −N(xk−1)
x
T(xk−1)x
from wage-earners in the bracket [xk−1, xk]. Summing over k gives an approximate total
revenue of
n
	
k=1
N(xk) −N(xk−1)
x
T(xk−1)x
where n is the number of subintervals. The larger n is, the more accurate your estimate
will be, so you take the limit of the sum as n →∞. When you do this, two things hap-
pen. First, the quantity
N(xk) −N(xk−1)
x
approaches the derivative, N ′(xk−1). Second, the sum, which you recognize as a Rie-
mann sum, approaches the integral
 M
0
N ′(x)T(x) dx
You now take the limit as M →+∞to get
Total tax revenue =
 +∞
0
N ′(x)T(x) dx
This improper integral is ﬁne in theory, but the actual calculation will have to be done
numerically, so you stick with the upper limit of $10 million for now. You will have to
check that it is reasonable at the end (notice that, by the graph of N ′, it appears that ex-
tremely few, if any, people earn that much). Now you already have a formula for N ′(x),
but you still need to write formulas for the tax functions T(x) for both alternatives.
Alternative 1The graph in Figure 24 rises linearly from 0 to 40,000 as x ranges from 0 to
80,000, and then stays constant at 40,000. The slope of the ﬁrst part is 40,000/80,000 =
1/2. The taxation function is therefore
T(x) =
 x
2
if 0 ≤x ≤80,000

To perform the integration, you will therefore need to break the integral into two pieces,
the ﬁrst from 0 to 80,000 and the second from 80,000 to 10,000,000. In other words,
R1 =

 10,000,000
80,000
(7000 e−(x−30,000)2/400,000,000)40,000 dx
You decide not to attempt this by hand!40 You use numerical integration software to
obtain a grand total of R1 = $3,732,760,000,000,or $3.73276 trillion (rounded to six
signiﬁcant digits).
Alternative 2 The graph in Figure 25 rises linearly from 0 to 20,000 as x ranges from
20,000 to 60,000, then rises from 20,000 to 60,000 as x ranges from 60,000 to 80,000,
and then stays constant at 60,000. The slope of the ﬁrst incline is 1/2 and the slope of
the second incline is 2 (this is why the marginal tax rates are 50% and 200%
respectively). The taxation function is therefore
T(x) =

if 60,000 ≤x ≤80,000

if x ≥80,000
Values of x between 0 and 20,000 do not contribute to the integral, so
R2 =

80,000
(7000 e−(x−30,000)2/400,000,000)60,000 dx
Numerical integration software gives R2 = $1.52016 trillion—considerably less than
Alternative 1. Thus, even though Alternative 2 taxes the wealthy more heavily, it yields
less total revenue.
Now what about the cutoff at $10 million annual income? If you try either integral
again with an upper limit of $100 million, you will see no change in either result to six
signiﬁcant digits. There simply are not enough taxpayers earning an income above
$10,000,000 to make a difference. You conclude that your answers are sufﬁciently accu-
rate and that the ﬁrst alternative provides more tax revenue.

1. Use

to enter the sequence of numbers 1 through 20 into the
list L1, representing the trading days.
2. Using the list editor accessible through the 
menu,
enter the daily stock prices in list L2. 
3. You can now calculate the list of 5-day moving averages
by using the following command:
seq((L2(X)+L2(X-1)+L2(X-2)+L2
(X-3)+L2(X-4))/5,X,5,20)→L3
This has the effect of putting the moving averages into
elements 1 through 15 of list L3.
4. If you wish to plot the moving average on the same graph
as the daily prices, you will want the averages in L3 to
match up with the prices in L2. One way to do this is to
put four more entries at the beginning of L3—say, copies
of the ﬁrst four entries of L2. The following command
accomplishes this:

Introduction
We have studied functions of a single variable extensively. But not every useful function
is a function of only one variable. In fact, most are not. For example, if you operate an
online bookstore in competition with Amazon.com, BN.com, and Booksamillion.com,
your sales may depend on those of your competitors. Your company’s daily revenue
might be modeled by a function such as
R(x, y, z) = 10,000 −0.01x −0.02y −0.01z + 0.00001yz
where x, y, and z are the online daily revenues of Amazon.com, BN.com, and Book-
samillion.com, respectively. Here, R is a function of three variables because it depends
on x, y, and z. As we shall see, the techniques of calculus extend readily to such func-
tions. Among the applications we shall look at is optimization: ﬁnding, where possible,
the maximum or minimum of a function of two or more variables.

Function of Several Variables
A real-valued function, f, of x, y, z, . . . is a rule for manufacturing a new number, writ-
ten f (x, y, z, . . .), from the values of a sequence of independent variables x, y, z, . . . .
The function f is called a real-valued function of two variables if there are two
independent variables, a real-valued function of three variables if there are three
independent variables, and so on.

f (x, y) = x −y
f (1, 2) = 1 −2 = −1

15.1 Functions of Several Variables from the
Numerical and Algebraic Viewpoints
Recall that a function of one variable is a rule for manufacturing a new number f (x)
from a single independent variable x. A function of two or more variables is similar, but
the new number now depends on more than one independent variable.

As with functions of one variable, functions of several variables can be represented
numerically (using a table of values), algebraically (using a formula as in the above
examples), and sometimes graphically1 (using a graph).
Let’s now look at a number of examples of interesting functions of several variables.
15.1 Functions of Several Variables from the Numerical and Algebraic Viewpoints

1 See the next section.
Example 1 Cost Function
You own a company that makes two models of speakers: the Ultra Mini and the Big
Stack. Your total monthly cost (in dollars) to make x Ultra Minis and y Big Stacks is
given by
C(x, y) = 10,000 + 20x + 40y
What is the signiﬁcance of each term in this formula?
Solution The terms have meanings similar to those we saw for linear cost functions of
a single variable. Let us look at the terms one at a time.
Constant Term Consider the monthly cost of making no speakers at all (x = y = 0).
We ﬁnd
C(0, 0) = 10,000
Cost of making no speakers is $10,000.
Thus, the constant term 10,000 is the ﬁxed cost, the amount you have to pay each
month even if you make no speakers.
Coefﬁcients of x and y Suppose you make a certain number of Ultra Minis and Big
Stacks one month and the next month you increase production by one Ultra Mini. The
costs are
C(x, y) = 10,000 + 20x + 40y
C(x + 1, y) = 10,000 + 20(x + 1) + 40y
= 10,000 + 20x + 20 + 40y
= C(x, y) + 20
Thus, each Ultra Mini adds $20 to the total cost. We say that $20 is the marginal cost
of each Ultra Mini. Similarly, because of the term 40y, each Big Stack adds $40 to the
total cost. The marginal cost of each Big Stack is $40.
This is an example of a linear function of two variables. The coefﬁcients of x and y
play roles similar to that of the slope of a line. In particular, they give the rates of change
of the function as each variable increases while the other stays constant (think about it).
We shall say more about linear functions below.

how you can use a TI-83/84
and Excel to display various 
values of C(x, y).
+Before we go on... In Example 1, which values of x and y may we substitute into
C(x, y)? Certainly we must have x ≥0 and y ≥0 because it makes no sense to speak
of manufacturing a negative number of speakers. Also, there is certainly some upper
bound to the number of speakers that can be made in a month. The bound might take one
of several forms. The number of each model may be bounded—say x ≤100 and
y ≤75. The inequalities 0 ≤x ≤100 and 0 ≤y ≤75 describe the region in the plane
shaded in Figure 2.

Functions of Several Variables
+Before we go on... In Example 1, we gave a linear function of two variables. In Exam-
ple 2 we have a linear function of three variables. Katz came up with his model by
surveying a large number of faculty members and then ﬁnding the linear function “best”
ﬁtting the data. Such models are called multiple linear regression models. In the Case
Study at the end of this chapter, we shall see a spreadsheet method of ﬁnding the coefﬁ-
cients of a multiple regression model from a set of observed data.
What does this model say about the value of a single book or a single article? If a
book takes 15 times as long to write as an article, how would you recommend that a
professor spend her writing time? ■
Here are two simple kinds of functions of several variables.

Example 2 Faculty Salaries
David Katz came up with the following function for the salary of a professor with
10 years of teaching experience in a large university.
S(x, y, z) = 13,005 + 230x + 18y + 102z
Here, S is the salary in 1969–1970 in dollars per year, x is the number of books the
professor has published, y is the number of articles published, and z is the number
of “excellent” articles published.* What salary do you expect that a professor with
10 years’ experience earned in 1969–1970 if she published two books, 20 articles, and 3
“excellent” articles?
Solution All we need to do is calculate
S(2, 20, 3) = 13,005 + 230(2) + 18(20) + 102(3)
= $14,131
* David A. Katz, “Faculty Salaries, Promotions and Productivity at a Large University,” American Economic
Review, June 1973, pp. 469–477. Prof. Katz’s equation actually included other variables, such as the number
of dissertations supervised; our equation assumes that all of these are zero.
Another possibility is that the total number of speakers is bounded—
say, x + y ≤150. This, together with x ≥0 and y ≥0, describes the region shaded in
Figure 3.
In either case, the region shown represents the pairs (x, y) for which C(x, y) is
deﬁned. Just as with a function of one variable, we call this region the domain of the
function. As before, when the domain is not given explicitly, we agree to take the largest
domain possible. ■

Linear Function
A linear function of the variables x1, x2, . . . , xn is a function of the form
f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = a0 + a1x1 + · · · + anxn
(a0, a1, a2, . . . , an constants)
1. f (x, y) = 3x −5y
Linear function of x and y
2. C(x, y) = 10,000 + 20x + 40y

Example 2

quick Examples
Interaction Function
If we add to a linear function one or more terms of the form bxixj (b a nonzero constant
and i ̸= j), we get a second-order interaction function.
1. C(x, y) = 10,000 + 20x + 40y + 0.1xy
2. R(x, y, z) = 10,000 −0.01x −0.02y −0.01z + 0.00001yz
So far, we have been specifying functions of several variables algebraically—by
using algebraic formulas. If you have ever studied statistics, you are probably familiar
with statistical tables. These tables may also be viewed as representing functions
numerically, as the next example shows.
Example 3 Function Represented Numerically: Body Mass Index
The following table lists some values of the “body mass index,” which gives a measure
of the massiveness of your body, taking height into account.* The variable w represents
* It is interesting that weight-lifting competitions are usually based on weight, rather than body mass index. As
a consequence, taller people are at a signiﬁcant disadvantage in weight-lifting competitions because they must
compete with shorter, stockier people of the same weight. (An extremely thin, very tall person can weigh as
much as a muscular short person, although his body mass index would be signiﬁcantly lower.) SOURCES: Shape

Working for the national ac-
counts 
division 
for 
PepsiCo
Beverages & Foods, I need to
understand applied mathematics
in order to control the variables
associated with making profit,
manufacturing, production, and
most importantly selling our
products to mass club channels.
Examples of these large, “quality product at great value” out-
lets are Wal*Mart, Costco and Target. The types of products I
handle include Gatorade, Tropicana, and Quaker foods.
Our studies show that the grocery store channels’ sales
are flattening or declining as a whole in lieu of large, national
outlets like the above. So in order to maximize growth in this
segment of our business, I meet with regional buying offices
of these chains and discuss various packaging, pricing, prod-
uct, promotional and shipping options so that we can suc-
cessfully compete in the market.
A number of factors must be taken into consideration in
order to meet my company’s financial forecasts. Precision
usingmathematicalmodelsiskeyhere,sincesomanyvariables
can impact last-minute decision-making. Extended variables
of supply-and-demand include time of year, competitive
landscape, special coupon distribution and other promotions,
selling cycles and holidays, size of the outlets, and yes—even
the weather.
For example, it’s natural to assume that when it’s hot
outside people will buy more thirst-quenching products like
Gatorade. But since our business is so precise, we need to un-
derstand mathematically how the weather affects sales. A
mathematical model developed by Gatorade analyzes long-
term data that impacts sales by geographic market due to the
weather. Its findings include exponentially increased sales of
Gatorade for each degree above the 90 degrees. I share our
mathematical analysis like this study with buyers and negoti-
ate larger orders based on up-to-the-minute weather fore-
casts. The result: increased sales of product based on math.

your weight in pounds, and h represents your height in inches. An individual with a body
mass index of 25 or above is generally considered overweight.
As the table shows, the value of the body mass index depends on two quantities: w and
h. Let us write M(w, h) for the body mass index function. What are M(140, 62) and
M(210, 63)?
Solution We can read the answers from the table:
M(140, 62) = 25.4
w = 140 lb, h = 62 in.
and
M(210, 63) = 36.9
w = 210 lb, h = 63 in.
The function M(w, h) is actually given by the formula
M(w, h) =
0.45w
(0.0254h)2
[The factor 0.45 converts the weight to kilograms, and 0.0254 converts the height to me-
ters. If w is in kilograms and h is in meters, the formula is simpler: M(w, h) = w/h2.]
Distance and Related Functions
Newton’s Law of Gravity states that the gravitational force exerted by one particle on
another depends on their masses and the distance between them. The distance between

r is a circle centered at the origin with radius r. From the second Quick Example, we get
the following equation for the circle centered at the origin with radius r:

x2 + y2 = r

Derivation
The distance d is shown in the ﬁgure below.
By the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle shown, we get
d2 = (x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2
Taking square roots (d is a distance, so we take the positive square root), we get the dis-
tance formula. Notice that if we switch x1 with x2 or y1 with y2, we get the same result.

2. The circle of radius 2 centered at the origin has equation x2 + y2 = 4.
3. The circle of radius 3 centered at the origin has equation x2 + y2 = 9.

Now, let’s return to Newton’s Law of Gravity. According to Newton’s Law, the grav-
itational force exerted on a particle with mass m by another particle with mass M is
given by the following function of distance:
F(r) = G Mm
r2
Here, r is the distance in meters between the two particles, the masses M and m are given
in kilograms, G ≈6.67 × 10−11, and the resulting force is measured in newtons.2

Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
2 A newton is the force that will cause a 1-kilogram mass to accelerate at 1 m/sec2.
3 Mathematicians often refer to this as a “punctured plane.”
Example 4 Newton’s Law of Gravity
Find the gravitational force exerted on a particle with mass m situated at the point (x, y)
by another particle with mass M situated at the point (a, b). Express the answer as a
function F of the coordinates of the particle with mass m.
Solution The formula above for gravitational force is expressed as a function of the
distance, r, between the two particles. Because we are given the coordinates of the
two particles, we can express r in terms of these coordinates using the formula for
distance:
r =

(x −a)2 + (y −b)2
Substituting for r, we get
F(x, y) = G
Mm
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2
+Before we go on... In Example 4, notice that F(a, b) is not deﬁned because substitut-
ing x = a and y = b makes the denominator equal 0. Thus, the largest possible domain
of F excludes the point (a, b). Because (a, b) is the only value of (x, y) for which F
is not deﬁned, we deduce that the domain of F consists of all points (x, y) except for
(a, b). In other words, the domain of F is the whole xy-plane with the single point (a, b)
missing.3 ■
Q: Why have we expressed F as a function of x and y only, and not also as a function of 
a and b?
A: It’s a matter of interpretation. When we write F as a function of x and y, we are thinking of
a and b as constants. For example, (a, b) could be the coordinates of the sun—which we often
assume to be fixed in space—while (x, y) could be the coordinates of the earth—which is moving
around the sun. In that case it is most natural to think of x and y as variables and a and b as
constants. In another context we may indeed want to consider F as a function of four variables,
x, y, a, and b. ■

Three-Dimensional Space and the Graph
of a Function of Two Variables
Just as functions of a single variable have graphs, so do functions of two or more vari-
ables. Recall that the graph of f (x) consists of all points (x, f (x)) in the xy-plane. By
analogy, we would like to say that the graph of a function of two variables, f (x, y),

consists of all points of the form (x, y, f (x, y)). Thus, we need three axes: the x-, y-,
and z-axes. In other words, our graph will live in three-dimensional space, or 
3-space.13
Just as we had two mutually perpendicular axes in two-dimensional space (the
xy-plane; see Figure 4a), so we have three mutually perpendicular axes in three-
dimensional space (Figure 4b).

Figure 5
In both 2-space and 3-space, the axis labeled with the last letter goes up. Thus, the
z-direction is the “up” direction in 3-space, rather than the y-direction.
Three important planes are associated with these axes: the xy-plane, the yz-plane,
and the xz-plane. These planes are shown in Figure 5. Any two of these planes intersect
in one of the axes (for example, the xy- and xz-planes intersect in the x-axis) and all three
meet at the origin. Notice that the xy-plane consists of all points with z-coordinate zero,
the xz-plane consists of all points with y = 0, and the yz-plane consists of all points with
x = 0.
In 3-space, each point has three coordinates, as you might expect: the x-coordinate,
the y-coordinate, and the z-coordinate. To see how this works, look at the following
examples.
Example 1 Plotting Points in Three Dimensions
Locate the points P(1, 2, 3), Q(−1, 2, 3), R(1, −1, 0), and S(1, 2, −2) in 3-space.
Solution To locate P, the procedure is similar to the one we used in 2-space: Start at the
origin, proceed 1 unit in the x direction, then proceed 2 units in the y direction, and ﬁnally,
proceed three units in the z direction. We wind up at the point P shown in Figures 6a
and 6b.
Here is another, extremely useful way of thinking about the location of P. First, look
at the x- and y-coordinates, obtaining the point (1, 2) in the xy-plane. The point we want
is then three units vertically above the point (1, 2) because the z-coordinate of a point is
just its height above the xy-plane. This strategy is shown in Figure 6c.
13 If we were dealing instead with a function of three variables, then we would need to go to four-dimensional
space. Here we run into visualization problems (to say the least!) so we won’t discuss the graphs of functions
of three or more variables in this text.

Our next task is to describe the graph of a function f (x, y) of two variables.
Graph of a Function of Two Variables
The graph of the function f of two variables is the set of all points (x, y, f (x, y)) in
three-dimensional space, where we restrict the values of (x, y) to lie in the domain of f.
In other words, the graph is the set of all the points (x, y, z) with z = f (x, y).
For every point (x, y) in the domain of f, the z-coordinate of the corresponding
point on the graph is given by evaluating the function at (x, y). Thus, there will be a
point on the graph above every point in the domain of f, so that the graph is usually a sur-
face of some sort.
Example 2 Graph of a Function of Two Variables
Describe the graph of f (x, y) = x2 + y2.
Solution Your ﬁrst thought might be to make a table of values. You could choose some
values for x and y and then, for each such pair, calculate z = x2 + y2. For example, you
might get the following table:

This gives the following nine points on the graph of f: (−1, −1, 2), (−1, 0, 1),\
(−1, 1, 2), (0, −1, 1), (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, −1, 2), (1, 0, 1), and (1, 1, 2). These points
are shown in Figure 8.
The points on the xy-plane we chose for our table are the grid points in the xy-plane,
and the corresponding points on the graph are marked with solid dots. The problem is
that this small number of points hardly tells us what the surface looks like, and even if
we plotted more points, it is not clear that we would get anything more than a mass of
dots on the page.

Figure 8

If we slice vertically through this surface along the yz-plane, we get the picture in
Figure 10. The shape of the front edge, where we cut, is a parabola. To see why, note that
the yz-plane is the set of points where x = 0. To get the intersection of x = 0 and
z = x2 + y2, we substitute x = 0 in the second equation, getting z = y2. This is the
equation of a parabola in the yz-plane.
Similarly, we can slice through the surface with the xz-plane by setting y = 0. This
gives the parabola z = x2 in the xz-plane (Figure 11).
We can also look at horizontal slices through the surface, that is, slices by planes
parallel to the xy-plane. These are given by setting z = c for various numbers c. For ex-
ample, if we set z = 1, we will see only the points with height 1. Substituting in the
equation z = x2 + y2 gives the equation
1 = x2 + y2
which is the equation of a circle of radius 1. If we set z = 4, we get the equation of a cir-
cle of radius 2:
4 = x2 + y2
In general, if we slice through the surface at height z = c, we get a circle (of radius √c).
Figure 12 shows several of these circles.

What can we do? There are several alternatives. One place to start is to use tech-
nology to draw the graph.* We then obtain something like Figure 9. This particular sur-
face is called a paraboloid.

Functions of Several Variables
Looking at these circular slices, we see that this surface is the one we get by taking
the parabola z = x2 and spinning it around the z-axis. This is an example of what is
known as a surface of revolution.
+Before we go on... Notice that each horizontal slice through the surface in Example 2
was obtained by putting z = constant. This gave us an equation in x and y that de-
scribed a curve. These curves are called the level curves of the surface z = f (x, y). In
Example 2, the equations are of the form x2 + y2 = constant, and so the level curves
are circles. Figure 13 shows the level curves for c = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
The level curves give a contour map or topographical map of the surface. Each
curve shows all of the points on the surface at a particular height c. You can use this con-
tour map to visualize the shape of the surface. Imagine moving the contour at c = 1 to
a height of 1 unit above the xy-plane, the contour at c = 2 to a height of 2 units above
the xy-plane, and so on. You will end up with something like Figure 12. ■

Analyzing the Graph of a Function of Two Variables
If possible, use technology to render the graph of a given function z = f (x, y). Given
the function z = f (x, y), you can analyze its graph as follows:
Step 1 Obtain the x-, y-, and z-intercepts (the places where the surface crosses the
coordinate axes).
x-Intercept(s): Set y = 0 and z = 0 and solve for x.
y-Intercept(s): Set x = 0 and z = 0 and solve for y.
z-Intercept:
Set x = 0 and y = 0 and compute z.
Step 2 Slice the surface along planes parallel to the
xy-, yz-, and xz-planes.

Set y = constant and analyze the resulting curves.
These are the curves resulting from slices parallel to the xz-plane.

Spreadsheets often have built-in features to render surfaces such as the paraboloid
in Example 2. In the following example, we use Excel to graph another surface and then
analyze it as above.

Describe the graph of f (x, y) = x2 −y2.

See the Technology Guides at the end of the chapter to ﬁnd out how to obtain a similar
graph from scratch on an ordinary Excel sheet.
The graph shows an example of a “saddle point” at the origin (we return to this idea
in a Section 15.4). To analyze the graph for the features shown in the box above, replace
f (x, y) by z to obtain
z = x2 −y2
Step 1 Intercepts Setting any two of the variables x, y, and z equal to zero results in the
third also being zero, so the x-, y-, and z-intercepts are all 0. In other words, the surface
touches all three axes in exactly one point, the origin.
Step 1 Slices Slices in various directions show more interesting features.
Slice by x = c
This gives z = c2 −y2, which is the equation of a parabola that
opens downward. You can see two of these slices (c = −3, c = 3) as the front and
back edges of the surface in Figure 14. [More are shown in Figure 15a.]
Slice by y = c
This gives z = x2 −c2, which is the equation of a parabola once
again—this time, opening upward. You can see two of these slices (c = −3, c = 3) as
the left and right edges of the surface in Figure 14. [More are shown in Figure 15b.]
Slice by z = c
This gives x2 −y2 = c, which is a hyperbola. The level curves for
various values of c are visible in Figure 14 as the boundaries between the different

To obtain really beautiful renderings of surfaces, you could use one of the commer-
cial computer algebra software packages, such as Mathematica® or Maple®. These
packages can do much more than render surfaces and can be used, for example, to com-
pute derivatives and antiderivatives, to solve equations algebraically, and to perform a
variety of algebraic computations.

Describe the graph of g(x, y) = 1
2x + 1
3 y −1.
Solution Notice ﬁrst that g is a linear function of x and y. Figure 16 shows a portion of
the graph, which is a plane.
We can get a good idea of what plane this is by looking at the x-, y-, and z-intercepts.
x-intercept Set y = z = 0, which gives x = 2.
y-intercept Set x = z = 0, which gives y = 3.
z-intercept Set x = y = 0, which gives z = −1.
Three points are enough to deﬁne a plane, so we can say that the plane is the one
passing through the three points (2, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), and (0, 0, −1).

angles to each other.

15.3 Partial Derivatives
Recall that if f is a function of x, then the derivative d f/dx measures how fast f changes
as x increases. If f is a function of two or more variables, we can ask how fast f changes
as each variable increases while the others remain ﬁxed. These rates of change are called
the “partial derivatives of f,” and they measure how each variable contributes to the
change in f. Here is a more precise deﬁnition.
1064
Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
quick Examples
Partial Derivatives
The partial derivative of f with respect to x is the derivative of f with respect to x, when
all other variables are treated as constant. Similarly, the partial derivative of f with
respect to y is the derivative of f with respect to y, with all other variables treated as 
constant, and so on for other variables. The partial derivatives are written as ∂f
∂x , ∂f
∂y , and 
so on. The symbol ∂is used (instead of d ) to remind us that there is more than one vari-
able and that we are holding the other variables ﬁxed.
1. Let f (x, y) = x2 + y2.
∂f
∂x = 2x + 0 = 2x
Because y2 is treated as a constant
∂f
∂y = 0 + 2y = 2y
Because x2 is treated as a constant
2. Let z = x2 + xy.
∂z
∂x = 2x + y
∂
∂x (xy) = ∂
∂x (x · constant) = constant = y
∂z
∂y = 0 + x = x
∂
∂y (xy) = ∂
∂x (constant · y) = constant = x
3. Let f (x, y) = x2y + y2x −xy + y .
∂f
∂x = 2xy + y2 −y
y is treated as a constant
∂f
∂y = x2 + 2xy −x + 1
x is treated as a constant
Interpretation
∂f
∂x is the rate at which f changes as x changes, for a ﬁxed (constant) y.
∂f
∂y is the rate at which f changes as y changes, for a ﬁxed (constant) x.
Example 1 Marginal Cost: Linear Model
We return to Example 1 from Section 15.1. Suppose that you own a company that makes
two models of speakers, the Ultra Mini and the Big Stack. Your total monthly cost (in
dollars) to make x Ultra Minis and y Big Stacks is given by
C(x, y) = 10,000 + 20x + 40y

15.3 Partial Derivatives
1065
What is the signiﬁcance of ∂C
∂x and of ∂C
∂y ?
Solution First we compute these partial derivatives:
∂C
∂x = 20
∂C
∂y = 40
We interpret the results as follows: ∂C
∂x = 20 means that the cost is increasing at a rate
of $20 per additional Ultra Mini (if production of Big Stacks is held constant); ∂C
∂y = 40
means that the cost is increasing at a rate of $40 per additional Big Stack (if production
of Ultra Minis is held constant). In other words, these are the marginal costs of each
model of speaker.
+Before we go on... How much does the cost rise if you increase x by x and y by y?
In Example 1, the change in cost is given by
C = 20x + 40y = ∂C
∂x x + ∂C
∂y y
This suggests the chain rule for several variables. Part of this rule says that if x and y
are both functions of t, then C is a function of t through them, and the rate of change of
C with respect to t can be calculated as
dC
dt = ∂C
∂x · dx
dt + ∂C
∂y · dy
dt
We shall not have a chance to use this interesting result in this book. ■

Another possibility for the cost function in the preceding example is the interaction
model
C(x, y) = 10,000 + 20x + 40y + 0.1xy
a. Now what are the marginal costs of the two models of speakers?
b. What is the marginal cost of manufacturing Big Stacks at a production level of 100
Ultra Minis and 50 Big Stacks per month?
Solution
a. We compute the partial derivatives:
∂C
∂x = 20 + 0.1y
∂C
∂y = 40 + 0.1x
Thus, the marginal cost of manufacturing Ultra Minis increases by $0.1 or 10¢ for
each Big Stack that is manufactured. Similarly, the marginal cost of manufacturing
Big Stacks increases by 10¢ for each Ultra Mini that is manufactured.

At a production level of 100 Ultra Minis and 50 Big Stacks per month, we have

Partial derivatives of functions of three variables are obtained in the same way as
those for functions of two variables, as the following example shows:

∂y and ∂f
∂z if f (x, y, z) = xy2z3 −xy.

15.3 Partial Derivatives
1067
Solution Although we now have three variables, the calculation remains the same:
∂f/∂x is the derivative of f with respect to x, with both other variables, y and z, held
constant:
∂f
∂x = y2z3 −y
Similarly, ∂f/∂y is the derivative of f with respect to y, with both x and z held constant:
∂f
∂y = 2xyz3 −x
Finally, to ﬁnd ∂f/∂z, we hold both x and y constant and take the derivative with respect
to z.
∂f
∂z = 3xy2z2
Note The procedure for ﬁnding a partial derivative is the same for any number of vari-
ables: To get the partial derivative with respect to any one variable, we treat all the oth-
ers as constants. ■
Geometric Interpretation of Partial Derivatives
Recall that if f is a function of one variable x, then the derivative d f/dx gives the
slopes of the tangent lines to its graph. Now, suppose that f is a function of x and y.
By deﬁnition, ∂f/∂x is the derivative of the function of x we get by holding y ﬁxed.
If we evaluate this derivative at the point (a, b), we are holding y ﬁxed at the value
b, taking the ordinary derivative of the resulting function of x, and evaluating this
at x = a. Now, holding y ﬁxed at b amounts to slicing through the graph of f along
the plane y = b, resulting in a curve. Thus, the partial derivative is the slope of the
tangent line to this curve at the point where x = a and y = b, along the plane y = b
(Figure 18).
This ﬁts with our interpretation of ∂f/∂x as the rate of increase of f with in-
creasing x when y is held ﬁxed at b.
The other partial derivative, ∂f/∂y|(a, b) is, similarly, the slope of the tangent
line at the same point P(a, b, f (a, b)) but along the slice by the plane x = a. You
should draw the corresponding picture for this on your own.
Second-Order Partial Derivatives
Just as for functions of a single variable, we can calculate second derivatives. Suppose,
for example, that we have a function of x and y, say, f (x, y) = x2 −x2y2. We know that
∂f
∂x = 2x −2xy2
If we take the partial derivative with respect to x once again, we obtain
∂
∂x
∂f
∂x

= 2 −2y2
Take ∂
∂x of ∂f
∂x
(The symbol ∂/∂x means “the partial derivative with respect to x,” just as d/dx stands
for “the derivative with respect to x.”)This is called the second-order partial derivative

and is written ∂2f
∂x2. We get the following derivatives similarly:
∂f
∂y = −2x2y
∂2f
∂y2 = −2x2
Take ∂
∂y of ∂f

Now what if we instead take the partial derivative with respect to y of ∂f/∂x?

Take ∂

∂y [2x −2xy2] = −4xy
Here, ∂2f
∂y∂x means “ﬁrst take the partial derivative with respect to x and then with 
respect to y,” and is called a mixed partial derivative. If we differentiate in the oppo-
site order, we get
∂2f
∂x∂y = ∂
∂x
∂f
∂y

= ∂
∂x [−2x2y] = −4xy
the same expression as ∂2f
∂y∂x . This is no coincidence: The mixed partial derivatives ∂2f
∂x∂y
and ∂2f
∂y∂x are always the same as long as the ﬁrst partial derivatives are both differentiable
functions of x and y and the mixed partial derivatives are continuous. Because all the
functions we shall use are of this type, we can take the derivatives in any order we like
when calculating mixed derivatives.
Here is another notation for partial derivatives that is especially convenient for
second-order partial derivatives:
fx means ∂f
∂x
fy means ∂f
∂y
fxy means ( fx)y = ∂2f
∂y∂x (Note the order in which the derivatives are taken.)
fyx means ( fy)x = ∂2f

15.4 Maxima and Minima
In Chapter 12 on applications of the derivative, we saw how to locate relative extrema of
a function of a single variable. In this section we extend our methods to functions of two
variables. Similar techniques work for functions of three or more variables.
Figure 19 shows a portion of the graph of the function f (x, y) = 2(x2 + y2) −
(x4 + y4) + 3. The graph resembles a “ﬂying carpet,” and several interesting points,
marked a, b, c, and d are shown.
1. The point a has coordinates (0, 0, f (0, 0)), is directly above the origin (0, 0), and is
the lowest point in its vicinity; water would puddle there. We say that f has a relative
minimum at (0, 0) because f (0, 0) is smaller than f (x, y) for any (x, y) near (0, 0).
2. Similarly, the point b is higher than any point in its vicinity. Thus, we say that f has a
relative maximum at (1, 1).
3. The points c and d represent a new phenomenon and are called saddle points. They
are neither relative maxima nor relative minima but seem to be a little of both.
To see more clearly what features a saddle point has, look at Figure 20, which
shows a portion of the graph near the point d.
If we slice through the graph along y = 1, we get a curve on which d is the lowest
point. Thus, d looks like a relative minimum along this slice. On the other hand, if we
slice through the graph along x = 0, we get another curve, on which d is the highest
point, so d looks like a relative maximum along this slice. This kind of behavior char-
acterizes a saddle point: f has a saddle point at (r, s) if f has a relative minimum at
(r, s) along some slice through that point and a relative maximum along another slice
through that point. If you look at the other saddle point, c, in Figure 19, you see the
same characteristics.
While numerical information can help us locate the approximate position of rela-
tive extrema and saddle points, calculus permits us to locate these points accurately as
we did for functions of a single variable. Look once again at Figure 19, and notice the
following:
• The points P, Q, R and S are all in the interior of the domain of f; that is, none of them
lies on the boundary of the domain. Said another way, we can move some distance in
any direction from any of these points without leaving the domain of f.
• The tangent lines along the slices through these points parallel to the x- and y-axes are
horizontal. Thus, the partial derivatives ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y are zero when evaluated at
any of the points P, Q, R and S. This gives us a way of locating candidates for relative
extrema and saddle points.
The following summary generalizes and also expands on some of what we have just
said:

Relative and Absolute Maxima and Minima
The function f (x, y, . . .) has a relative maximum at (r, s, . . .) if f (r, s, . . .) ≥
f (x, y, . . .) for every point (x, y, . . .) near (r, s, . . .). in the domain of f. We say that
f (x, y, . . .) has an absolute maximum at (r, s, . . .) if f (r, s, . . .) ≥f (x, y, . . .) for
every point (x, y, . . .) in the domain of f. The terms relative minimum and absolute
minimum are deﬁned in a similar way.

In the next example we ﬁrst locate all critical points, and then classify each one as
a relative maximum, minimum, saddle point, or none of these.

Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
quick Examples
* We’ll be looking at extrema on the boundary of the domain of a function in the next section. What we are
calling critical points correspond to the stationary points of a function of one variable. We shall not consider
the analogs of the singular points.
† In fact, it is a saddle point. (Can you see why?).
‡ Recall that if a product of two numbers is zero, then one or the other must be zero. In this case the number
e−(x2+y2) can’t be zero (since eu is never zero), which gives the result claimed.
Locating Candidates for Relative Extrema and Saddle Points in the Interior of
the Domain of f:
• Set ∂f
∂x = 0, ∂f
∂y = 0, . . . simultaneously, and solve for x, y, . . ..
• Check that the resulting points (x, y, . . .) are in the interior of the domain of f.
Points at which all the partial derivatives of f are zero are called critical points. Thus,
the critical points are the only candidates for relative extrema and saddle points in the
interior of the domain of f.*
1. Let f (x, y) = x3 + (y −1)2. Then ∂f
∂x = 3x2 and ∂f
∂y = 2(y −1). Thus, we solve
the system
3x2 = 0
and
2(y −1) = 0
The ﬁrst equation gives x = 0, and the second gives y = 1. Thus, the only critical
point is (0, 1). Because the domain of f is the whole Cartesian plane, the point (0, 1)
is interior, and hence a candidate for a relative extremum or saddle point.†
2. Let f (x, y) = e−(x2+y2). Taking partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero
gives
−2xe−(x2+y2) = 0
We set ∂f
∂x = 0.
−2ye−(x2+y2) = 0
We set ∂f
∂y = 0.
The ﬁrst equation implies that x = 0,‡ and the second implies that y = 0. Thus, the
only critical point is (0, 0). This point is interior, and hence a candidate for a relative
extremum or saddle point.
Example 1 Locating and Classifying Critical Points
Locate all critical points of f (x, y) = x2y −x2 −2y2. Graph the function to classify
the critical points as relative maxima, minima, saddle points, or none of these.
Solution The partial derivatives are
fx = 2xy −2x = 2x(y −1)
fy = x2 −4y

15.4 Maxima and Minima 1075
Setting these equal to zero gives
x = 0
or
y = 1
x2 = 4y
We get a solution by choosing either x = 0 or y = 1 and substituting into x2 = 4y.
Case 1: x = 0
Substituting into x2 = 4y gives 0 = 4y and hence y = 0. Thus, the
critical point for this case is (x, y) = (0, 0).
Case 2: y = 1
Substituting into x2 = 4y gives x2 = 4 and hence x = ±2. Thus, we
get two critical points for this case: (2, 1) and (−2, 1).
We now have three critical points altogether: (0, 0), (2, 1), and (−2, 1). We get the cor-
responding points on the graph by substituting for x and y in the equation for f to get the
z-coordinates. The points are (0, 0, 0), (2, 1, −2), and (−2, 1, −2).
Classifying the Critical Points Graphically
To classify the critical points graphically,
we look at the graph of f shown in Figure 21.
Examining the graph carefully, we see that the point (0, 0, 0) is a relative maximum.
As for the other two critical points, are they saddle points or are they relative maxima?
They seem to be relative maxima along the y-direction, but the slice in the x-direction
(through x = 1) seems to be horizontal. However, a diagonal slice (along x = ±y)
shows these two points as minima and so they are saddle points. (If you don’t believe
this, we will get more evidence below and in a later example.)
Classifying the Critical Points Numerically
We can use a tabular representation of
the function to classify the critical points numerically. The following tabular representa-
tion of the function can be obtained using Excel. (See the Excel Technology Guide dis-
cussion of Section 15.1 Example 3 at the end of the chapter for information on using
Excel to generate such a table.)

The shaded and colored cells show rectangular neighborhoods of the three critical points
(0, 0), (2, 1), and (−2, 1). (Notice that they overlap.) The values of f at the points are at
the centers of these rectangles. Looking at the gray neighborhood of (x, y) = (0, 0), we
see that f (0, 0) = 0 is the largest value of f in the shaded cells, suggesting that f has a
maximum at (0, 0). The shaded neighborhood of (2, 1) on the right shows f (2, 1) = −2
as the maximum along some slices (e.g., the vertical slice), and a minimum along the
diagonal slice from top left to bottom right. This is what results in a saddle point on the
graph. The point (−2, 1) is similar, and thus f also has a saddle point at (−2, 1).

Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
Q: Is there an algebraic way of deciding whether a given point is a relative maximum, relative
minimum, or saddle point?
A: There is a “second derivative test” for functions of two variables, stated as follows. ■
quick Examples
Second Derivative Test for Functions of Two Variables
Suppose (a, b) is a critical point in the interior of the domain of the function f of two
variables. Let H be the quantity
H = fxx(a, b) fyy(a, b) −[ fxy(a, b)]2
H is called the Hessian.
Then, if H is positive,
• f has a relative minimum at (a, b) if fxx(a, b) > 0.
• f has a relative maximum at (a, b) if fxx(a, b) < 0.
If H is negative,
• f has a saddle point at (a, b).
If H = 0, the test tells us nothing, so we need to look at the graph or a numerical table
to see what is going on.
1. Let f (x, y) = x2 −y2. Then
fx = 2x
and
fy = −2y
which gives (0, 0) as the only critical point. Also,
fxx = 2, fxy = 0,
and
fyy = −2
Note that these are constant
which gives H = (2)(−2) −02 = −4. Because H is negative, we have a saddle point
at (0, 0).
2. Let f (x, y) = x2 + 2y2 + 2xy + 4x. Then
fx = 2x + 2y + 4
and
fy = 2x + 4y
Setting these equal to zero gives a system of two linear equations in two unknowns:
x + y = −2
x + 2y = 0
This system has solution (−4, 2), so this is our only critical point. The second partial
derivatives are fxx = 2, fxy = 2, and fyy = 4, so H = (2)(4) −22 = 4. Since
H > 0 and fxx > 0, we have a relative minimum at (−4, 2).
Note There is a second derivative test for functions of three or more variables, but it is
considerably more complicated. We stick with functions of two variables for the most
part in this book. The justiﬁcation of the second derivative test is beyond the scope of
this book. ■

Deriving the Regression Formulas
Back in Section 1.5, we presented the following set of formulas for the regression or
best-ﬁt line associated with a given set of data points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn).
Example 2 Using the Second Derivative Test
Use the second derivative test to analyze the function f (x, y) = x2y −x2 −2y2 dis-
cussed in Example 1, and conﬁrm the results we got there.
Solution We saw in Example 1 that the ﬁrst-order derivatives are
fx = 2xy −2x = 2x(y −1)
fy = x2 −4y
and the critical points are (0, 0), (2, 1), and (−2, 1). We also need the second derivatives:
fxx = 2y −2
fxy = 2x
fyy = −4
The point (0, 0): fxx(0, 0) = −2, fxy(0, 0) = 0, fyy(0, 0) = −4, so H = 8. Because
H > 0 and fxx(0, 0) < 0, the second derivative test tells us that f has a relative maxi-
mum at (0, 0).
The point (2, 1): fxx(2, 1) = 0, fxy(2, 1) = 4 and fyy(2, 1) = −4, so H = −16. Since
H < 0, we know that f has a saddle point at (2, 1).
The point (−2, 1): fxx(−2, 1) = 0, fxy(−2, 1) = −4 and fyy(−2, 1) = −4, so once
again H = −16, and f has a saddle point at (−2, 1).
We now show how to derive these formulas. Recall that the regression line is deﬁned to
be the line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, measured by the ver-
tical distances shown in Figure 22, which shows a regression line associated with n = 5
data points. In the ﬁgure, the points P1, . . . , Pn on the regression line have coordinates

(x1, mx1 + b), (x2, mx2 + b), . . . , (xn, mxn + b). The residuals are the quantities
yObserved −yPredicted:
y1 −(mx1 + b), y2 −(mx2 + b), . . . , yn −(mxn + b)
The sum of the squares of the residuals is therefore
S(m, b) = [y1 −(mx1 + b)]2 + [y2 −(mx2 + b)]2 + · · · + [yn −(mxn + b)]2
and this is the quantity we must minimize by choosing m and b. Because we reason that
there is a line that minimizes this quantity, there must be a relative minimum at that
point. We shall see in a moment that the function S has at most one critical point, which
must therefore be the desired absolute minimum. To obtain the critical points of S, we
set the partial derivatives equal to zero and solve:
Sm = 0: −2x1[y1 −(mx1 + b)] −· · · −2xn[yn −(mxn + b)] = 0
Sb = 0:
−2[y1 −(mx1 + b)] −· · · −2[yn −(mxn + b)] = 0
Dividing by −2 and gathering terms allows us to rewrite the equations as
m(x2
1 + · · · + x2
n) + b(x1 + · · · + xn) = x1y1 + · · · + xnyn
m(x1 + · · · + xn) + nb
= y1 + · · · + yn
We can rewrite these equations more neatly using -notation:
m
 x2
+ b
 x

=  xy
m
 x

+ nb
=  y
This is a system of two linear equations in the two unknowns m and b. It may or may not
have a unique solution. When there is a unique solution, we can conclude that the best
ﬁt line is given by solving these two equations for m and b. Alternatively, there is a gen-
eral formula for the solution of any system of two equations in two unknowns, and if we
apply this formula to our two equations, we get the regression formulas above.

15.5 Constrained Maxima and Minima 
and Applications
So far we have looked only at the relative extrema of functions with no constraints.
However, in Section 12.2 we saw examples in which we needed to ﬁnd the maximum or
minimum of an objective function subject to one or more constraints on the independent
variables. For instance, consider the following problem:
Minimize S = xy + 2xz + 2yz
subject to xyz = 4 with x > 0, y > 0, z > 0
Our strategy for solving such problems is essentially the same as the strategy we
used earlier. First, we use the constraint equations to eliminate variables. In the examples
in this section, we are able to reduce our objective function to a function of only two vari-
ables. Next, we locate any critical points, and then determine whether they are maxima,
minima, or neither.
An alternative method, called the method of Lagrange Multipliers, can be used even
when it is impossible to eliminate variables using the constraint equations.
First, we see how to solve the above constrained minimization problem using the
ﬁrst method.
1082
Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
Example 1 Constrained Minimization Problem
Minimize S = xy + 2xz + 2yz subject to xyz = 4 with x > 0, y > 0, z > 0.
Solution As suggested in the above discussion, we proceed as follows:
Solve the constraint equation for one of the variables and then substitute in the
objective function. The constraint equation is xyz = 4. Solving for z gives
z = 4
xy
The objective function is S = xy + 2xz + 2yz, so substituting z = 4/xy gives
S = xy + 2x 4
xy + 2y 4
xy
= xy + 8
y + 8
x
Minimize the resulting function of two variables. We use the method in Section 15.4
to ﬁnd the minimum of S = xy + 8
y + 8
x for x > 0 and y > 0: We look for critical
points:
Sx = y −8
x2
Sy = x −8
y2
Sxx = 16
x3
Sxy = 1
Syy = 16
y3
We now equate the ﬁrst partial derivatives to zero:
y = 8
x2
and
x = 8
y2

15.5 Constrained Maxima and Minima and Applications
1083
To solve for x and y, we substitute the ﬁrst of these equations in the second, getting
x = x4
8
x4 −8x = 0
x(x3 −8) = 0
The two solutions are x = 0, which we reject because x cannot be zero, and x = 2. Sub-
stituting x = 2 in y = 8/x2 gives y = 2 also. Thus, the only critical point is (2, 2). To
apply the second derivative test, we compute
Sxx(2, 2) = 2
Sxy(2, 2) = 1
Syy(2, 2) = 2
and ﬁnd that H = 3 > 0, so we have a relative minimum at (2, 2).
The corresponding value of z is given by the constraint equation:
z = 4
xy = 4
4 = 1
The corresponding value of the objective function is
S = xy + 8
y + 8
x = 4 + 8
2 + 8
2 = 12
Figure 23 shows a portion of the graph of S = xy + 8
y + 8
x for positive x and y (drawn
using the Excel 3-D Grapher in the Chapter 15 utilities available online), and suggests
that there is a single absolute minimum, which must be at our only candidate point (2, 2).
We conclude that the minimum of S is 12 and occurs at (2, 2, 1).

Example 2 Minimizing Area
Find the dimensions of an open-top rectangular box that has a volume of 4 cubic feet and
the smallest possible surface area.
Solution Our ﬁrst task is to rephrase this request as a mathematical optimization prob-
lem. Figure 24 shows a picture of the box with dimensions x, y, and z.
We want to minimize the total surface area, which is given by
A = xy + 2xz + 2yz
Base + Sides + Front and Back
This is our objective function. We can’t simply choose x, y, and z to all be zero; however,
because the enclosed volume must be 4 cubic feet. So,
xyz = 4
Constraint
This is our constraint equation. Other unstated constraints are x > 0, y > 0, and z > 0,
because the dimensions of the box must be positive. We now restate the problem as
follows:
Minimize A = xy + 2xz + 2yz
subject to xyz = 4, x > 0, y > 0, z > 0
But this is exactly the problem in Example 1, which has a solution x = 2, y = 2,
z = 1, A = 12. Thus, the required dimensions of the box are
x = 2 ft, y = 2 ft, z = 1 ft
requiring a total surface area of 12 ft2.

The Method of Lagrange Multipliers
Suppose we have a constrained optimization problem in which it is difﬁcult or impossi-
ble to solve a constraint equation for one of the variables. Then we can use the method
of Lagrange multipliers to avoid this difﬁculty. We restrict attention to the case of a
single constraint equation, although the method generalizes to any number of constraint
equations.
1084
Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
Q: In Example 1 we checked that we had a relative minimum at (x, y) = (2, 2) and we were
persuaded graphically that this was probably an absolute minimum. Can we be sure that this
relative minimum is an absolute minimum?
A: Yes. There must be a least surface area among all boxes that hold 4 cubic feet. (Why?)
Because this would give a relative minimum of A and because the only possible relative mini-
mum of A occurs at (2, 2), this is the absolute minimum. ■
Locating Relative Extrema Using the Method of Lagrange Multipliers
To locate the candidates for relative extrema of a function f (x, y, . . .) subject to the
constraint g(x, y, . . .) = 0, we solve the following system of equations for x, y, . . .
and λ:
fx = λgx
fy = λgy
. . .
g = 0
The unknown λ is called a Lagrange multiplier. The points (x, y, . . .) that occur in
solutions are then the candidates for the relative extrema of f subject to g = 0.
Although the justiﬁcation for the method of Lagrange multipliers is beyond the
scope of this text, we will demonstrate by example how it is used.
Example 3 Using Lagrange Multipliers
Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to ﬁnd the maximum value of f (x, y) = 2xy
subject to x2 + 4y2 = 32.
Solution We start by rewriting the problem in standard form:
Maximize f (x, y) = 2xy
subject to x2 + 4y2 −32 = 0
Here, g(x, y) = x2 + 4y2 −32, and the system of equations we need to solve is thus
fx = λgx
or
2y = 2λx
fy = λgy
or
2x = 8λy
g = 0
or
x2 + 4y2 −32 = 0

15.5 Constrained Maxima and Minima and Applications
1085
A convenient way to solve such a system is to solve one of the equations for λ and then
substitute in the remaining equations.Thus, we start by solving the ﬁrst equation to obtain
λ = y
x
(A word of caution: Because we divided by x, we made the implicit assumption that
x ̸= 0, so before continuing we should check what happens if x = 0. But if x = 0, then
the ﬁrst equation, 2y = 2λx, tells us that y = 0 as well, and this contradicts the third
equation: x2 + 4y2 −32 = 0. Thus, we can rule out the possibility that x = 0.) Substi-
tuting in the remaining equations gives
x = 4λy = 4y2
x
or
x2 = 4y2
x2 + 4y2 −32 = 0
Notice how we have reduced the number of unknowns and also the number of equations
by one. We can now substitute x2 = 4y2 in the last equation, obtaining
4y2 + 4y2 −32 = 0
8y2 = 32
y = ±2
We now substitute back to obtain
or
x2 = 4y2 = 16
x = ±4
We don’t need the value of λ, so we won’t solve for it. Thus, the candidates for rela-
tive extrema are given by x = ±4 and y = ±2, that is, the four points (−4, −2),
(−4, 2), (4, −2), and (4, 2). Recall that we are seeking the values of x and y that give the
maximum value for f (x, y) = 2xy. Because we now have only four points to choose
from, we compare the values of f at these four points and conclude that the maximum
value of f occurs when (x, y) = (−4, −2) or (4, 2).
Something is suspicious in Example 3. We didn’t check to see whether these candi-
dates were relative extrema to begin with, let alone absolute extrema! How do we justify
this omission? One of the difﬁculties with using the method of Lagrange Multipliers
is that it does not provide us with a test analogous to the second derivative test for
functions of several variables. However, if you grant that the function in question does
have an absolute maximum, then we require no test, because one of the candidates must
give this maximum.
Q: But how do we know that the given function has an absolute maximum?
A: The best way to see this is by giving a geometric interpretation. The constraint
x2 + 4y2 = 32 tells us that the point (x, y) must lie on the ellipse shown in Figure 25. The
function f(x, y) = 2xy gives the area of the rectangle shaded in Figure 25.
Because there must be a largest such rectangle, the function f must have an absolute max-
imum for at least one pair of coordinates (x, y).■

mization problem in Example 1:

Example 4 Using Lagrange Multipliers: Function of Three Variables
Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to ﬁnd the minimum value of S = xy +
2xz + 2yz subject to xyz = 4 with x > 0, y > 0, z > 0.
Solution We start by rewriting the problem in standard form:
Maximize f (x, y, z) = xy + 2xz + 2yz
subject to xyz −4 = 0 (with x > 0, y > 0, z > 0)
Here, g(x, y, z) = xyz −4, and the system of equations we need to solve is thus
fx = λgx
or
y + 2z = λyz
fy = λgy
or
x + 2z = λxz
fz = λgz
or
2x + 2y = λxy
g = 0
or
xyz −4 = 0
As in the last example, we solve one of the equations for λ and substitute in the others.
The ﬁrst equation gives
λ = 1
z + 2
y
Substituting this into the second and third equations gives
x + 2z = x + 2xz
y
or
2 = 2x
y
Subtract x from both sides and then divide by z.
giving
y = x
Substituting the expression for λ into the third equation gives
2x + 2y = xy
z + 2x
or
2 = x
z
Subtract 2x from both sides and then divide by y.
giving
z = x
2
Now we have both y and z in terms of x. We substitute these values in the last (constraint)
equation:
x(x)
x
2

−4 = 0
x3 = 8
x = 2
Thus, y = x = 2, and z = x
2 = 1. Therefore, the only critical point occurs at (2, 2, 1) as
we found in Example 1, and the corresponding value of S is
S = xy + 2xz + 2yz = (2)(2) + 2(2)(1) + 2(2)(1) = 12
+Before we go on... Again, the method of Lagrange Multipliers does not tell us whether
the critical point in Example 4 is a maximum, minimum, or neither. However, if you
grant that the function in question does have an absolute minimum, then the values we
found must give this minimum value. ■

FAQs
When to Use Lagrange Multipliers
Q: When can I use the method of Lagrange multipliers? When should I use it?
A: We have discussed the method only when there is a single equality constraint. There is a
generalization, which we do not discuss, that works when there are more equality constraints
(we need to introduce one multiplier for each constraint). So, if you have a problem with more
than one equality constraint, or with any inequality constraints, you must use the method we
discussed earlier in this section. On the other hand, if you have one equality constraint, and it
would be difficult to solve it for one of the variables, then you should use Lagrange multipliers.
We have noted in the exercises where you might use Lagrange multipliers. ■

15.6 Double Integrals and Applications
When discussing functions of one variable, we computed the area under a graph by inte-
gration. The analog for the graph of a function of two variables is the volume V under the
graph, as in Figure 26.
Think of the region R in the xy-plane as the “shadow” under the portion of the
surface z = f (x, y) shown.
By analogy with the deﬁnite integral of a function of one variable, we make the
following deﬁnition:
z 
x 
y 
R 
V 
z  f(x, y)
Figure 26

Geometric Definition of the Double Integral
The double integral of f (x, y) over the region R in the xy-plane is deﬁned as
(Volume above the region R and under the graph of f )
−(Volume below the region R and above the graph of f )
We denote the double integral of f (x, y) over the region R by 

R f (x, y) dx dy.
Take f (x, y) = 2 and take R to be the rectangle 0 ≤x ≤1, 0 ≤y ≤1. Then the graph
of f is a ﬂat horizontal surface z = 2, and

As we saw in the case of the deﬁnite integral of a function of one variable, we also
desire numerical and algebraic deﬁnitions for two reasons: (1) to make the mathemati-
cal deﬁnition more precise, so as not to rely on the notion of “volume,” and (2) for direct
computation of the integral using technology or analytical tools.
We start with the simplest case, when the region R is a rectangle a ≤x ≤b and
c ≤y ≤d (see Figure 27). To compute the volume over R, we mimic what we did to
ﬁnd the area under the graph of a function of one variable. We break up the interval
[a, b] into m intervals all of width x = (b −a)/m, and we break up [c, d] into n
intervals all of width y = (d −c)/n. Figure 28 shows an example with m = 4 and
n = 5.
This gives us mn rectangles deﬁned by xi−1 ≤x ≤xi and yj−1 ≤y ≤yj. Over one
of these rectangles, f is approximately equal to its value at one corner—say f (xi, yj).

The volume under f over this small rectangle is then approximately the volume of the
rectangular brick (size exaggerated) shown in Figure 29. This brick has height f (xi, yj),
and its base is x by y. Its volume is therefore f (xi, yj)xy. Adding together the
volumes of all of the bricks over the small rectangles in R, we get

Note This deﬁnition is adequate (the limit exists) when f is continuous. More elaborate
deﬁnitions are needed for general functions. ■
This deﬁnition also gives us a clue about how to compute a double integral. The in-
nermost sum is m

The outermost limit is then also a Riemann sum, and we get the following way of cal-

Often we need to integrate over regions R that are not rectangular. There are two
cases that come up. The ﬁrst is a region like the one shown in Figure 31.
In this region, the bottom and top sides are deﬁned by functions y = c(x) and
y = d(x), respectively, so that the whole region can be described by the inequalities
a ≤x ≤b and c(x) ≤y ≤d(x). To evaluate a double integral over such a region, we
have the following formula:

Solution We can integrate in the opposite order if we can describe the region in Figure
32 in the way shown in Figure 33. In fact, it is the region 0 ≤y ≤2 and y ≤x ≤2. To
see this, we draw a horizontal line through the region, as in Figure 34. The line extends
from x = y on the left to x = 2 on the right, so y ≤x ≤2. The possible heights for such
a line are 0 ≤y ≤2. We can now compute the integral:

Note Many regions can be described in two different ways, as we saw in Examples 2

pays to consider both. ■
Applications
There are many applications of double integrals besides ﬁnding volumes. For example,
we can use them to ﬁnd averages. Remember that the average of f (x) on [a, b] is given
by 
 b
a f (x) dx divided by (b −a), the length of the interval.

Example 4 Average Revenue
Your company is planning to price its new line of subcompact cars at between $10,000
and $15,000. The marketing department reports that if the company prices the cars at p
dollars per car, the demand will be between q = 20,000 −p and q = 25,000 −p cars
sold in the ﬁrst year. What is the average of all the possible revenues your company
could expect in the ﬁrst year?
Solution Revenue is given by R = pq as usual, and we are told that
10,000 ≤p ≤15,000
and
20,000 −p ≤q ≤25,000 −p
This domain D of prices and demands is shown in Figure 35.
To average the revenue R over the domain D, we need to compute the area A of D.
Using either calculus or geometry, we get A = 25,000,000. We then need to integrate R
over D:

Squaresville is a city in the shape of a square 5 miles on a side. The population density
at a distance of x miles east and y miles north of the southwest corner is P(x, y) =
x2 + y2 thousand people per square mile. Find the total population of Squaresville.
Solution Squaresville is pictured in Figure 37, in which we put the origin in the south-
west corner of the city.
+Before we go on... To check that the answer obtained in Example 4 is reasonable, no-
tice that the revenues at the corners of the domain are $100,000,000 per year,
$150,000,000 per year (at two corners), and $75,000,000 per year. Some of these are
smaller than the average and some larger, as we would expect. ■
Another useful application of the double integral comes about when we consider
density. For example, suppose that P(x, y) represents the population density (in people
per square mile, say) in the city shown in Figure 36.
If we break the city up into small rectangles (for example, city blocks), then the
population in the small rectangle xi−1 ≤x ≤xi and yj−1 ≤y ≤yj is approximately
P(xi, yj)xy. Adding up all of these population estimates, we get
Total population ≈

j=1

31. Website Trafﬁc OHaganBooks.com has two principal com-
petitors: JungleBooks.com and FarmerBooks.com. Current
website trafﬁc at OHaganBooks.com is estimated at 5000 hits
per day. This number is predicted to decrease by 0.8 for every
new customer of JungleBooks.com and by 0.6 for every new
customer of FarmerBooks.com. 
a. Use this information to model the daily website trafﬁc at
OHaganBooks.com as a linear function of the new
customers of its two competitors.
b. According to the model, if Junglebooks.com gets 100 new
customers and OHaganBooks.com trafﬁc drops to 4770 hits
per day, how many new customers has FarmerBooks.com
obtained?
32. Website Trafﬁc Refer to the model in Exercise 31.
a. The model in Exercise 31 did not take into account
the growth of the total online consumer base. 
OHaganBooks.com expects to get approximately one
additional hit per day for every 10,000 new Internet
shoppers. Modify your model in part (a) so as to include
this information using a new independent variable.
b. How many new Internet shoppers would it take to offset
the effects on trafﬁc at OHaganBooks.com of 100 new
customers at each of its competitor sites? 
33. Internet Advertising To increase business at OHaganBooks.
com, you have purchased banner ads at well-known Internet
portals and have advertised on television. The following inter-
action model shows the average number h of hits per day as a
function of monthly expenditures x on banner ads and y on
television advertising (x and y are in dollars).
h(x, y) = 1800 + 0.05x + 0.08y + 0.00003xy
a. Based on your model, how much trafﬁc can you anticipate
if you spend $2000 per month for banner ads and $3000
per month on television advertising?
b. Evaluate∂h
∂y , specify its units of measurement, and indicate
whether it increases or decreases with increasing x.
c. How much should the company spend on banner ads to
obtain 1 hit per day for each $5 spent per month on
television advertising? 
34. Internet Advertising Refer to the model in Exercise 33. One
or more of the following ﬁve statements is correct. Identify
which one(s).
(A) If nothing is spent on television advertising, one more
dollar spent per month in banner ads will buy approxi-
mately 0.05 hits per day at OHaganBooks.com
(B) If nothing is spent on television advertising, one more hit
per day at OHaganBooks.com will cost the company
about 5¢ per month in banner ads.
(C) If nothing is spent on banner ads, one more hit per day at
OHaganBooks.com will cost the company about 5¢ per
month in banner ads.

Functions of Several Variables
(D) If nothing is spent on banner ads, one more dollar spent
per month in banner ads will buy approximately 0.05
hits per day at OHaganBooks.com
(E) Hits at OHaganBooks.com cost approximately 5¢ per
month spent on banner ads, and this cost increases at a
rate of 0.003¢ per month, per hit.
35. Productivity The holiday season is now at its peak and
OHaganBooks.com has been understaffed and swamped with
orders. The current backlog (orders unshipped for two or
more days) has grown to a staggering 50,000, and new orders
are coming in at a rate of 5000 per day. Research based on
productivity data at OHaganBooks.com results in the follow-
ing model:
P(x, y) = 1000x0.9y0.1 additional orders ﬁlled per day
where x is the number of additional personnel hired and y is
the daily budget (excluding salaries) allocated to eliminating
the backlog. How many additional orders will be ﬁlled per
day if the company hires 10 additional employees and bud-
gets an additional $1000 per day? (Round the answer to the
nearest 100.)
36. Productivity Refer to the model in Exercise 35. In addition to
the daily budget, extra stafﬁng costs the company $150 per
day for every new staff member hired. In order to ﬁll at least
15,000 orders per day at a minimum total daily cost, how
many new staff members should the company hire? (Use the
method of Lagrange Multipliers).
37. Proﬁt If OHaganBooks.com sells x paperback books and
y hardcover books per week, it will make an average weekly
proﬁt of
P(x, y) = 3x + 10y dollars
If it sells between 1200 and 1500 paperback books and be-
tween 1800 and 2000 hardcover books per week, what is the
average of all its possible weekly proﬁts?

CAS E  STU DY:
Modeling Household Income
The Millennium Real Estate Development Corpora-
tion is interested in developing housing projects for
medium-sized families that have high household in-
comes. To decide which income bracket to target, the
company has asked you, a paid consultant, for an
analysis of household income and household size in
the United States up to the year 2000. In particular,
Millennium is interested in three issues:
• The relationship between household size and household income and the effect of in-
creasing household size on household income.
• The household size that corresponds to the highest household income.
• The change in the relationship between household size and household income over
time.
• Some near-term projections of household income vs. household size following the
year 2000 (to, say, 2005).
You decide that a good place to start would be with a visit to the Census Bureau’s
website at http://www.census.gov. After some time battling with search engines, you dis-
cover detailed information on household size vs. household income35 for the period
35 Household income is adjusted for inﬂation and given in 2000 dollars. SOURCE: Bureau of the Census, 2002;

Household Size →
1967–2000. The following table summarizes the information on median household
income:

1102
Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
Now you deﬁnitely see two trends. First, the household income peaks at around 5 or
6 people per household, and then drops off at both ends. In fact, the slices through 
t = constant look parabolic. Second, the household income for all household sizes
seems to increase more or less linearly with time (the slices through n = constant are
approximately linear).
At this point you realize that a mathematical model of these data would be useful; not
only would it “smooth out the bumps” but it would give you a way to complete the pro-
ject for Millennium. Although technology can give you a regression model for data such
as this, it is up to you to decide on the form of the model. It is in choosing an appropriate
model that your analysis of the graph comes in handy. Because I appears to vary quadrat-
ically with the household size, you would like a general quadratic of the form
I = a + bn + cn2
for each value of time t. Also, because I should vary linearly with time t, you would like
I = mt + k
for each value of n. Putting these together, you get the following candidate model
I (n, t) = a1 + a2n + a3n2 + a4t
where a1, a2, a3, and a4 are constants you need to determine. 
You decide to use Excel to generate your model. The speciﬁc software tool you need
is called the “Analysis Toolpack” which comes with Excel. (It is found in the Tools menu
as “Data Analysis.” If it is missing, select Add-Ins from the Tools menu and check
“Analysis Toolpack.”)

You notice that the table is actually a numerical representation of the median household
income I as a function of two variables, the household size n and the year t. 
The numbers are a bit overwhelming, so you decide to use Excel to graph the data
as a surface (Figure 38).

Case Study
1103
The headings of each column show the variables n and t, with the income i in column
D. (Instead of using the calendar year for t, we have represented 1967 by t = 0.) Notice
that the columns of the original table are in column D, one beneath the other. Thus,
Columns A–C show the independent variables (and n2, which we will treat as an inde-
pendent variable for the regression), and column D contains the dependent variable.
You now select Data Analysis from the Tools menu. Under “Type of Analysis”
you select “Regression,” identify where the dependent and independent variables are
(D1–D239 for the Y range, and A1–C239 for the X range), check “Labels,” and hit “OK.”
Now you are set to do regression analysis. However, the data as shown in the table
are not in a form Excel can use for regression; the data need to be organized into
columns, as shown below.

A portion of the output is shown below, with some of the important statistics
highlighted.

Chapter 15
Functions of Several Variables
The desired constants a1, a2, a3, and a4 appear in the coefﬁcients column at the bottom
left, in the correct order: a1 is the “intercept,”, a2 is the coefﬁcient of n, and so on. Thus,
if we round to 5 signiﬁcant digits, we have
a1 = −5778.0
a2 = 21,008
a3 = −2139.1
a4 = 352.06
which gives our regression model:
I (n, t) = −5778.0 + 21,008n −2139.1n2 + 352.06t
Fine, you say to yourself, now you have the model, but how good a ﬁt is it to the
data? That is where the “Multiple R” at the top of the data analysis comes in. R is called
the multiple coefﬁcient of correlation, and generalizes the coefﬁcient of correlation
discussed in the section on regression in Chapter 1: The closer R is to 1, the better the
ﬁt. We can interpret its square, given in the table as “R Square” with value 0.938, as
indicating that approximately 94% of the variation in median income is explained by the
regression model, indicating an excellent ﬁt. The “P-values” at bottom right are also
indicators of the appropriateness of the model; a P-value close to zero indicates a high
degree of conﬁdence that the corresponding coefﬁcient is really nonzero, whereas a
P-value close to 1 indicates low conﬁdence (there is a P-value for each coefﬁcient).
Because all the values are extremely tiny, you are conﬁdent indeed that the model is an
appropriate one. Another statistical indicator is the value of “F” on the right—an
indicator of conﬁdence in the model as a whole. The fact that it too is large and its
“Signiﬁcance F” is tiny is yet another good sign.36
36 We are being deliberately vague about the exact meaning of these statistics, which are discussed fully in
many applied statistics texts.

Now you get to work, using the model to address the questions posed by Millennium.
1. The relationship between household size and household income and the effect of in-
creasing household size on household income. You already have a quantitative rela-
tionship in the form of the regression model. As for the second part of the question,
the rate of change of median household income with respect to household size is
given by the partial derivative:
∂I
∂n = 21,008 −4278.2n dollars per additional family member
Thus, for example, in a household of 4 people, 
∂I
∂n = 21,008 −4278.2(4) ≈$3895 per additional family member
On the other hand, when n = 5, one has
∂I
∂n = 21,008 −4278.2(5) = −$383 per additional family member
Notice that the derivative is independent of time: the rate of change of average fam-
ily income with respect to household size is independent of the date (according to
your model).
Figure 2
2, 3. The household size corresponding to the highest household income and the change in
the relationship over time. Although a glance at the graph shows you that there are no
relative maxima, holding t constant (that is, on any given year) gives a relative maxi-
mum along the corresponding slice when
∂I
∂n = 0
As comforting as these statistics are, nothing can be quite as persuasive as a graph.
You turn to the graphing software of your choice and notice that the graph of the model
appears to be a faithful representation of the data. (See Figure 2.)

Functions of Several Variables
or
21,008 −4278.2n = 0, 
which gives
n = 21,008
4278.2 ≈4.91
In other words, households of 5 tend to have the highest household incomes. Again,
∂I/∂n does not depend on t, so that this optimal household size seems independent of
time t.
4. Some near-term projections of household income vs. household size. As we have seen
throughout the book, extrapolation can be a risky venture; however, near-term
extrapolation from a good model can be reasonable. You enter the model in an Excel
spreadsheet to obtain the following predicted median household incomes for the years
2001–2005:

Use multiple regression to construct (a) a linear model and (b) an interaction model
for the data (round all coefﬁcients to four signiﬁcant digits). Does the interaction
model give a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt in terms of the multiple regression coefﬁcient?
Referring to the linear model, does the P-value for the coefﬁcient of y provide strong
evidence that the population proﬁle has been changing with time? (A P-value of α
indicates that we can be certain with a conﬁdence level of 1 −α that the associated
coefﬁcient is nonzero.)
4. Graph the data from the preceding exercise and decide whether the linear model gives
a faithful representation of the actual data. If not, propose and construct an alternative
model. How is the conﬁdence level in the coefﬁcient of y changed?
5. According to your model in the preceding question, why does the age-group with
maximum population not change over time? Propose a model in which it does.
Construct such a model, and test the additional coefﬁcient(s).

Introduction
Cyclical behavior is common in the business world: There are seasonal ﬂuctuations in
the demand for surﬁng equipment, swim wear, snow shovels, and many other items. The
nonlinear functions we have studied up to now cannot model this kind of behavior. To
model cyclical behavior, we need the trigonometric functions.
In the ﬁrst section, we study the basic trigonometric functions—especially the sine
and cosine functions from which all the trigonometric functions are built—and see how
to model various kinds of periodic behavior using these functions. The rest of the chap-
ter is devoted to the calculus of the trigonometric functions—their derivatives and
integrals—and to its numerous applications.

16.1 Trigonometric Functions, Models,
and Regression
The Sine Function
Figure 1 shows the approximate average daily high temperatures in New York’s Central
Park.1 If we draw the graph for several years, we get the repeating pattern shown in
Figure 2 where the x-coordinate represents time in years, with x = 0 corresponding to
August 1, and where the y-coordinate represents the temperature in °F. This is an exam-
ple of cyclical or periodic behavior.

From a mathematical point of view, the simplest models of cyclical behavior are the
sine and cosine functions. An easy way to describe these functions is as follows. Imag-
ine a bicycle wheel whose radius is one unit, with a marker attached to the rim of the rear
wheel, as shown in Figure 4.

Now, we can measure the height h(t) of the marker above the center of the wheel. As the
wheel rotates, h(t) ﬂuctuates between −1 and +1. Suppose that, at time t = 0 the
marker was at height zero as shown in the diagram, so h(0) = 0. Because the wheel has
a radius of one unit, its circumference (the distance all around) is 2π, where
π = 3.14159265 . . . . If the cyclist happens to be moving at a speed of 1 unit per second,
it will take the bicycle wheel 2π seconds to make one complete revolution. During the
time interval [0, 2π], the marker will ﬁrst rise to a maximum height of +1, drop to a low
point of −1, and then return to the starting position of 0 at t = 2π. This function h(t) is
called the sine function, denoted by sin(t). Figure 5 shows its graph.

Example 1 Some Trigonometric Functions
Use technology to plot the following pairs of graphs on the same set of axes.
a. f (x) = sin(x); g(x) = 2 sin(x)
b. f (x) = sin(x); g(x) = sin(x + 1)
c. f (x) = sin(x); g(x) = sin(2x)
Solution
a. (Important note: If you are using a calculator, make sure it is set to radian mode, not
degree mode.) We enter these functions as sin(x) and 2*sin(x), respectively.
We use the range −2π ≤x ≤2π (approximately −6.28 ≤x ≤6.28) for x suggested
by the graph in Figure 5, but with larger range of y-coordinates (why?): −3 ≤y ≤3.
The graphs are shown in Figure 6.
Here, f (x) = sin(x) is shown in orange, and g(x) = 2 sin(x) in turquoise. Notice
that multiplication by 2 has doubled the amplitude, or distance that it oscillates up
and down. Where the original sine curve oscillates between −1 and 1, the new curve
oscillates between −2 and 2. In general:

The General Sine Function
The general sine function is
f (x) = A sin[ω(x −α)] + C
Its graph is shown here.
• A is the amplitude (the height of each peak above the baseline).
• C is the vertical offset (height of the baseline).
• P is the period or wavelength (the length of each cycle) and is related to ω by
P = 2π/ω
or
ω = 2π/P
• ω is the angular frequency (the number of cycles in every interval of length 2π).
• α is the phase shift.

Example 2 Electrical Current
The typical voltage V supplied by an electrical outlet in the U.S. is a sinusoidal function
that oscillates between −165 volts and +165 volts with a frequency of 60 cycles per sec-
ond. Find an equation for the voltage as a function of time t.
Solution What we are looking for is a function of the form:
V(t) = A sin[ω(t −α)] + C
Referring to the ﬁgure above, we can determine the constants.

1116
Chapter 16
Trigonometric Models
Amplitude A and Vertical Offset C: Because the voltage oscillates between
−165 volts and +165 volts, we see that A = 165 and C = 0.
Period P: Because the electric current completes 60 cycles in one second, the
length of time it takes to complete one cycle is 1/60 second. Thus, the period is
P = 1/60.
Angular Frequency ω: This is given by the formula:
ω = 2π
P = 2π(60) = 120π
Phase Shift α: The phase shift α tells us when the curve ﬁrst crosses the t-axis as it
ascends. Because we are free to specify what time t = 0 represents, let us say that
the curve crosses 0 when t = 0, so α = 0.
Thus, the equation for the voltage at time t is
V(t) = A sin[ω(t −α)] + C
= 165 sin(120πt)
where t is time in seconds.
Example 3 Cyclical Employment Patterns
An economist consulted by your employment agency indicates that the demand for tem-
porary employment (measured in thousands of job applications per week) in your
county can be roughly approximated by the function
d = 4.3 sin(0.82t −0.3) + 7.3
where t is time in years since January 2000. Calculate the amplitude, the vertical offset,
the phase shift, the angular frequency, and the period, and interpret the results.
Solution To calculate these constants, we write:
d = A sin[ω(t −α)] + C = A sin[ωt −ωα] + C
= 4.3 sin(0.82t −0.3) + 7.3
and we see right away that A = 4.3 (the amplitude), C = 7.3 (vertical offset), and
ω = 0.82 (angular frequency). We also have
ωα = 0.3
so that
α = 0.3
ω = 0.3
0.82 ≈0.37
(rounding to two signiﬁcant digits; notice that all the constants are given to two digits).
Finally, we get the period using the formula:
P = 2π
ω = 2π
0.82 ≈7.7
We can interpret these numbers as follows: The demand for temporary employment
ﬂuctuates in cycles of 7.7 years about a baseline of 7300 job applications per week.
Every cycle, the demand peaks at 11,600 applications per week (4300 above the base-
line) and dips to a low of 3000. In May, 2000, (t = 0.37) the demand for employment
was at the baseline level and rising.

The Cosine Function
Closely related to the sine function is the cosine function, deﬁned as follows (refer to the
deﬁnition of the sine function for comparison):
16.1 Trigonometric Functions, Models, and Regression
1117
Cosine Function
Geometric Deﬁnition
The cosine of a real number t is the x-coordinate of the point P in the following diagram,
in which |t| is the length of the arc shown.
Notice that the coordinates of the point P in the diagram above are (cos t, sin t) and
that the distance from P to the origin is 1 unit. It follows from the Pythagorean Theorem
that the distance from a point (x, y) to the origin is 

x2 + y2. Thus:
Square of the distance from P to (0, 0) = 1
(sin t)2 + (cos t)2 = 1
We often write (sin t)2 as sin2 t and similarly for the cosine, so we can rewrite the
equation as

Graph of the Cosine Function
The graph of the cosine function is identical to the graph of the sine function, except that
it is shifted π/2 units to the left.
cos(t) = x-coordinate of the point P

Q: Since we can rewrite the cosine function in terms of the sine function, do we really need the
cosine function?
A: Technically, we don’t need the cosine function and could get by with only the sine function.
On the other hand, it is convenient to have the cosine function because it starts at its highest
point rather than at zero. These two functions and their relationship play important roles
throughout mathematics. ■

Chapter 16
Trigonometric Models
Fundamental Trigonometric Identities: Relationships 
between Sine and Cosine
The sine and cosine of a number t are related by
sin2 t + cos2 t = 1
We can obtain the cosine curve by shifting the sine curve to the left a distance of π/2.
[See Example 1(b) for a shifted sine function.] Conversely, we can obtain the sine curve
from the cosine curve by shifting it π/2 units to the right.These facts can be expressed as
cos t = sin(t + π/2)
sin t = cos(t −π/2)
Alternative Formulation
We can also obtain the cosine curve by ﬁrst inverting the sine curve vertically (replace 
t by −t) and then shifting to the right a distance of π/2. This gives us two alternative
formulas (which are easier to remember):
cos t = sin(π/2 −t)
sin t = cos(π/2 −t)
Cosine is the sine of the complementary angle
The General Cosine Function
The general cosine function is
f (x) = A cos[ω(x −α)] + C
Its graph is as follows:
Note that the basepoint of the cosine curve is at the highest point of the curve. All the
constants have the same meaning as for the general sine curve:
• A is the amplitude (the height of each peak above the baseline).
• C is the vertical offset (height of the baseline).
• P is the period or wavelength (the length of each cycle) and is related to ω by
P = 2π/ω
or
ω = 2π/P
• ω is the angular frequency (the number of cycles in every interval of length 2π).
• α is the phase shift.

Example 4 Cash Flows into Stock Funds
The annual cash ﬂow into stock funds (measured as a percentage of total assets) has
ﬂuctuated in cycles of approximately 40 years since 1955, when it was at a high point.
The highs were roughly +15% of total assets, whereas the lows were roughly −10% of
total assets.*
a. Model this cash ﬂow with a cosine function of the time t in years, with t = 0 repre-
senting 1955.
b. Convert the answer in part (a) to a sine function model.
Solution
a. Cosine modeling is similar to sine modeling; we are seeking a function of the form
P(t) = A cos[ω(t −α)] + C
Amplitude A and Vertical Offset C: The cash ﬂow ﬂuctuates between −10% and
+15%. We can express this as a ﬂuctuation of A = 12.5 about the average C = 2.5.
Period P: This is given as P = 40.
Angular Frequency ω: We ﬁnd ω from the formula
ω = 2π
P = 2π
40 = π
20 ≈0.157
Phase Shift α: The basepoint is at the high point of the curve, and we are told that
cash ﬂow was at its high point at t = 0. Therefore, the basepoint occurs at t = 0, and
so α = 0.
Putting the model together gives
P(t) = A cos[ω(t −α)] + C
≈12.5 cos(0.157t) + 2.5
where t is time in years since 1955.
b. To convert between a sine and cosine model, we can use one of the relationships given
earlier. Let us use the formula
cos x = sin(x + π/2)
Therefore,
P(t) ≈12.5 cos(0.157t) + 2.5
= 12.5 sin(0.157t + π/2) + 2.5

Solution
a. Following are the models obtained by using the TI-83/84 and Excel. (See the Tech-
nology Guide at the end of the chapter to ﬁnd out how to obtain these models.)
TI-83/84 :
S(t) ≈11.6 sin[0.910(t −1.63)] + 155
Excel :
S(t) ≈25.8 sin[0.96(t −1.22)] + 153

16.1 Trigonometric Functions, Models, and Regression
1121
Q: Why do the models from TI-83/84 and Excel differ so drastically?
A: Not all regression algorithms are identical, and it seems that the TI-83/84’s algorithm is not
very efficient at finding the best-fit sine curve. Indeed, the value for the sum of squares error
(SSE) for the TI-83/84 regression curve is around 5030, whereas it is around 2148 for the Excel
curve, indicating a far better fit.* Notice another thing: the sine curve does not appear to fit the
data well in either graph. In general, we can expect better agreement between the different
forms of technology for data that follow a sine curve more closely. ■
b. This model gives a period of approximately
TI-83/84:
P = 2π
ω ≈
2π
0.910 ≈6.9 weeks
Excel:
P = 2π
ω ≈2π
0.96 ≈6.5 weeks
So, both models predict a very similar period.
In week 23, we obtain the following predictions:
TI-83/84:
S (23) ≈11.6 sin [0.910 (23 −1.63)] + 155≈162 spam e-mails per day
Excel:
S (23) ≈25.8 sin [0.96 (23 −1.22)] + 153 ≈176 spam e-mails per day
Note: The actual ﬁgure for week 23 was 213 spam e-mails per day. The discrepancy
illustrates the danger of using regression models to extrapolate. ■
* This comparison is actually unfair: The method using Excel’s Solver starts with an initial guess of the coef-
ﬁcients, so the TI-83/84 algorithm, which does not require an initial guess, is starting at a signiﬁcant disad-
vantage. An initial guess that is way off can result in Solver coming up with a very different result! On the
other hand, the TI-83/84 algorithm seems problematic and tends to fail (giving an error message) on many sets
of data.

Theorem: Derivatives of the Sine and Cosine Functions
The sine and cosine functions are differentiable with

dx sin x = cos x
d
dx cos x = −sin x
Notice the sign change.

Quotient rule
* Apply the calculation thought experiment: If we were to compute x cos x, the last operation we would per-
form is the multiplication of x and cos x. Hence, x cos x is a product.
Before deriving these formulas, we can see right away that they are plausible by ex-
amining Figure 10, which shows the graphs of the sine and cosine functions together
with their derivatives.

Notice, for instance, that in Figure 10(a), the graph of sin x is rising most rapidly
when x = 0, corresponding to the maximum value of its derivative, cos x. When
x = π/2, the graph of sin x levels off, so that its derivative, cos x, is 0. Another point to
notice: Because periodic functions (such as sine and cosine) repeat their behavior, their
derivatives must also be periodic.
Derivation of Formulas for Derivatives of the Sine 
and Cosine Functions
We ﬁrst calculate the derivative of sin x from scratch, using the deﬁnition of the derivative:
d
dx f (x) = lim
h→0
f (x + h) −f (x)
h
Thus,
d
dx sin x = lim
h→0
sin (x + h) −sin x
h
We now use the addition formula given in Exercise Set 16.1:
sin (x + h) = sin x cos h + cos x sin h
Substituting this expression for sin(x + h) gives
d
dx sin x = lim
h→0
sin x cos h + cos x sin h −sin x
h
Grouping the ﬁrst and third terms together and factoring out the term sin x gives
d
dx sin x = lim
h→0
sin x(cos h −1) + cos x sin h
h
= lim
h→0
sin x(cos h −1)

h→0

h→0
cos h −1

Limit of a sum
and we are left with two limits to evaluate. Calculating these limits analytically requires
a little trigonometry.17 Alternatively, we can get a good idea of what these two limits are
by estimating them numerically or graphically. Figures 11 and 12 show the graphs of
(cos h −1)/h and (sin h)/h, respectively.
We ﬁnd that:
lim
h→0
cos h −1
h
= 0

Therefore,
d
dx sin x = (sin x)(0) + (cos x)(1) = cos x
This is the required formula for the derivative of sin x.
Turning to the derivative of the cosine function, we use the identity
cos x = sin (π/2 −x)
from Section 16.1. If y = cos x = sin (π/2 −x), then, using the chain rule, we have
dy
dx = cos(π/2 −x) d
dx (π/2 −x)
= (−1) cos(π/2 −x)
= −sin x
Using the identity cos(π/2 −x) = sin x
This is the required formula for the derivative of cos x.
Just as with logarithmic and exponential functions, the chain rule can be used to
ﬁnd more general derivatives.

Thus, the calculation thought experiment tells us that we are dealing with the sine of a quantity, and we use the
generalized rule.
Note: Avoid writing ambiguous expressions like cos(3x2 −1)(6x). Does this mean
cos[(3x2 −1)(6x)]
The cosine of the quantity (3x2 −1)(6x)
or does it mean
[cos(3x2 −1)](6x)?
The product of cos(3x2 −1) and 6x

To avoid the ambiguity, place the 6x in front of the cosine expression and write
6x cos(3x2 −1)
The product of 6x and cos (3x2 −1)

* Notice the difference between sin2 x and sin(x2). The ﬁrst is the square of sin x, whereas the second is the
sin of the quantity x2.
Example 1 Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions
Find the derivatives of the following functions:
a. f (x) = sin2 x
b. g(x) = sin2(x2)
c. h(x) = e−x cos(2x)
Solution
a. Recall that sin2 x = (sin x)2. The calculation thought experiment tells us that f (x) is
the square of a quantity.* Therefore, we use the chain rule (or generalized power rule)
for differentiating the square of a quantity:
d
dx (u2) = 2u du
dx
d
dx (sin x)2 = 2(sin x) d(sin x)
dx
u = sin x
= 2 sin x cos x
Thus, f ′(x) = 2 sin x cos x.
b. We rewrite the function g(x) = sin2(x2) as [sin(x2)]2. Because g(x) is the square of
a quantity, we have
d
dx sin2(x2) = d
dx [sin(x2)]2
Rewrite sin2 (−) as [sin(−)]2.
= 2 sin(x2) d[sin(x2)]
dx
d
dx [u2] = 2u du
dx with u = sin(x2)
= 2 sin(x2) · cos(x2) · 2x
d
dx sin u = cos u du
dx with u = x2
Thus, g′(x) = 4x sin(x2) cos(x2).
c. Because h(x) is the product of e−x and cos (2x), we use the product rule:
h′(x) = (−e−x) cos(2x) + e−x d
dx [cos(2x)]
= (−e−x) cos(2x) −e−x sin(2x) d
dx [2x]
= −e−x cos(2x) −2e−x sin(2x)
= −e−x[cos(2x) + 2 sin(2x)]
d
dx cos u = −sin u du
dx
Derivatives of Other Trigonometric Functions
Because the remaining trigonometric functions are ratios of sines and cosines, we can
use the quotient rule to ﬁnd their derivatives. For example, we can ﬁnd the derivative of 

tan x as follows:

The demand for gas at a utility company can be expected to ﬂuctuate in a similar
way because demand grows with increased heating requirements. A reasonable model
might therefore be
G = 400 −100 sin
π
6 (x −4)
	
Why did we subtract the sine term?
where G is the demand for gas in cubic yards per day. Find and interpret G′(10).

Since cos π = −1
Because the units of G′(10) are cubic yards per day per month, we interpret the result as
follows: On November 1 (x = 10) the daily demand for gas is increasing at a rate of
50π/3 ≈52 cubic yards per day, per month. This is consistent with Figure 13, which
shows the temperature decreasing on that date.

We saw in Section 13.1 that every calculation of a derivative also gives us a calculation of
an antiderivative. For instance, since we know that cos x is the derivative of sin x, we can
say that an antiderivative of cos x is sin x:

cos x dx = sin x + C
An antiderivative of cos x is sin x

Calculate 

(x2 + 1) sin(x + 1) dx.
Solution We use the column method of integration by parts described in Section 14.1.

[Notice that we used the shortcut formulas to repeatedly integrate sin(x + 1).] We can
now read the answer from the table:

(x2 + 1) sin(x + 1) dx = (x2 + 1)[−cos(x + 1)] −2x[−sin(x + 1)]
+ 2[cos(x + 1)] + C
= (−x2 −1 + 2) cos(x + 1) + 2x sin(x + 1) + C

Example 5 Integrating an Exponential Times Sine or Cosine
Calculate 

ex sin x dx.
Solution The integrand is the product of ex and sin x, so we put one in the D column
and the other in the I column. For this example, it doesn’t matter much which we put
where.
It looks as if we’re just spinning our wheels. Let’s stop and see what we have:

ex sin x dx = ex sin x −ex cos x −

ex sin x dx
At ﬁrst glance, it appears that we are back where we started, still having to evaluate

ex sin x dx. However, if we add this integral to both sides of the equation above, we
can solve for it:
2

ex sin x dx = ex sin x −ex cos x + C
(Why + C?) So,

ex sin x dx = 1
2ex sin x −1
2ex cos x + C
2
Because C/2 is just as arbitrary as C, we write C instead of C/2, and obtain

ex sin x dx = 1
2ex sin x −1
2ex cos x + C

25. Sales After several years in the business, OHaganBooks.com
noticed that its sales showed seasonal ﬂuctuations, so that
weekly sales oscillated in a sine wave from a low of 9000

From the graph, you deduce that the demand is roughly linear, but the supply tends
to oscillate above and below the demand graph fairly regularly. To see this oscillation
more clearly, you reason that it would be best to subtract the demand from the supply,
and so you enter the data in your worksheet, and compute and graph the differences be-
tween the supply and demand (Figure 15).

sine curve. Figure 16 shows the demand with its linear regression line and the surplus
(supply–demand) with its sine regression curve (t = 0 represents 1990).
Thus, your models for cocoa production and consumption (in thousands of tonnes)
are
Consumption = 68.71t + 2201
Production = Demand + Surplus = 148.2 sin[1.153(t + 1.170)] + 68.71t + 2254
These models allow you to make the following observations:
• Consumption of cocoa is increasing at an approximately constant rate of 68,710
tonnes per year.
• Production of cocoa ﬂuctuates from about 95,000 tonnes below consumption to
201,000 tonnes above it every 5.4 years. (See the exercises.)

Case Study

Interestingly—and this can also be seen in the raw data—production of cocoa exceeds
consumption on average. This can be explained by the phenomenon that production an-
ticipates a rising demand.
You now address the question: How does this pattern of production and consump-
tion affect cocoa inventories? The accumulated cocoa inventory from 1990 to time t can
be modeled by
A(t) =

 t

(148.2 sin[1.153(x + 1.170)] + 53) dx
≈

t
0
≈−128.5 cos[1.153(t + 1.170)] + 53t + 28
The graph of A(t) is shown in Figure 17.
The graph clearly indicates a rising world inventory of cocoa and strongly suggests
that production must be cut back substantially in order to reduce the surplus.
Exercises
1. Use the observed data to compute the actual accumulated cocoa inventory from the
start of 1990 through 2001 and compare it with the value predicted by the model.
(Use t to represent the time since the start of 1990 and round to the nearest 1000
tonnes.)
2. Justify the claim made above that production of cocoa ﬂuctuates from 95,000 tonnes
below consumption to 201,000 tonnes above it every 5.4 years.
3. What would the maximum accumulated inventory be if the production was given in-
stead by the following formula?
P(t) = 148.2 sin[1.153(t + 1.170)] + 68.71t + 2201
4. If the consumption of cocoa increased exponentially, but the surplus was still as
shown above, would you still advise cocoa producers to cut back on production?
Explain.

Solution with Technology We set up our worksheet as we did in Section 11.4, as shown below.
1. For our initial guesses, let us roughly estimate the parameters from the graph. The amplitude is around A = 30, and the
vertical offset is roughly C = 150. The period seems to be around 7 weeks, so let us choose P = 7. This gives
ω = 2π/P ≈0.9. Finally, let us take α = 0 to begin with.

with SSE ≈2148. Plotting the observed and predicted values of S gives the following graph:
Note that Solver estimated the period for us. However, in many situations, we know what to use for the period be-
forehand: For example, we expect sales of snow shovels to ﬂuctuate according to an annual cycle. Thus, if we were using
regression to ﬁt a regression sine or cosine curve to snow shovel sales data, we would set P = 1 year, compute ω, and
have Solver estimate only the remaining coefﬁcients: A, C, and α.

Introduction
Logic is the underpinning of all reasoned argument. The ancient Greeks recognized its
role in mathematics and philosophy, and studied it extensively. Aristotle, in his Organon,
wrote the ﬁrst systematic treatise on logic. His work had a heavy inﬂuence on philoso-
phy, science and religion through the Middle Ages.
But Aristotle’s logic was expressed in ordinary language, so was subject to the am-
biguities of ordinary language. Philosophers came to want to express logic more for-
mally and symbolically, more like the way that mathematics is written (Leibniz, in the
17th century, was probably the ﬁrst to envision and call for such a formalism). It was
with the publication in 1847 of G. Boole’s The Mathematical Analysis of Logic and
A. DeMorgan’s Formal Logic that symbolic logic came into being, and logic became
recognized as part of mathematics. Since Boole and DeMorgan, logic and mathematics
have been inextricably intertwined. Logic is part of mathematics, but at the same time it
is the language of mathematics. 
The study of symbolic logic is usually broken into several parts. The ﬁrst and most
fundamental is the propositional logic. Built on top of this is the predicate logic, which
is the language of mathematics. In this appendix we give an introduction to proposi-
tional logic. 
Statements and Logical Operators
Propositional logic is the study of propositions. A statement, or proposition, is any
declarative sentence which is either true (T) or false (F). We refer to T or F as the truth
value of the statement.

interactive treatment of logic,
including discussion of proofs,
rules of inference, and an
introduction to the predicate
calculus, go online and follow:

 Introduction to Logic
Example 1 Statements
a. “2 + 2 = 4” is a statement because it can be either true or false.* Because it happens
to be a true statement, its truth value is T.
b. “1 = 0” is also a statement, but its truth value is F.
c. “It will rain tomorrow” is a statement. To determine its truth value, we shall have to
wait for tomorrow.
d. “Solve the following equation for x” is not a statement, because it cannot be assigned
any truth value whatsoever. It is an imperative, or command, rather than a declarative
sentence.
e. “The number 5” is not a statement, because it is not even a complete sentence.
* Is “2 + 2 = 4” a sentence? Read it aloud: “Two plus two equals four,” is a perfectly respectable English sentence.

Appendix A
Logic
A P P E N D I X  A
Note Sentences that refer to themselves, or self-referential sentences, as illustrated in
Example 1(f), are not permitted to be statements. This eliminates the liar’s paradox and
several similar problems. ■
We shall use letters like p, q, r and so on to stand for statements. Thus, for exam-
ple, we might decide that p should stand for the statement “the moon is round.” We write
p: “the moon is round”
p is the statement that the moon is round
to express this. 
We can form new statements from old ones in several different ways. For example,
starting with p: “I am an Anchovian,” we can form the negation of p: “It is not the case
that I am an Anchovian” or simply “I am not an Anchovian.” 
f. “This statement is false” gets us into a bind: If it were true, then, because it is declar-
ing itself to be false, it must be false. On the other hand, if it were false, then its de-
claring itself false is a lie, so it is true! In other words, if it is true, then it is false, and
if it is false, then it is true, and we go around in circles. We get out of this bind by say-
ing that because the sentence cannot be either true or false, we refuse to call it a state-
ment. An equivalent pseudo-statement is: “I am lying,” so this sentence is known as
the liar’s paradox.
quick Examples
Negation of a Statement
If p is a statement, then its negation is the statement “not p” and is denoted by ∼p. We
mean by this that, if p is true, then ∼p is false, and vice versa.
1. If p: “2 + 2 = 4,” then ∼p: “It is not the case that 2 + 2 = 4,” or, more simply,
∼p: “2 + 2 ̸= 4.”
2. If q: “1 = 0,” then ∼q: “1 ̸= 0.”
3. If r: “Diamonds are a pearl’s best friend,” then ∼r: “Diamonds are not a pearl’s best
friend.”
4. If s: “All politicians are crooks,” then ∼s: “Not all politicians are crooks.”
5. Double Negation: If p is any statement, then the negation of ∼p is ∼(∼p): “not
(not p),” or, in other words, p. Thus ∼(∼p) has the same meaning as p.
Notes
1. Notice in Quick Example 1 above that ∼p is false, because p is true. However, in
Quick Example 2, ∼q is true, because q is false. A statement of the form ∼q can very
well be true; it is a common mistake to think it must be false. 
2. Saying that not all politicians are crooks is not the same as saying that no politicians
are crooks, but is the same as saying that some (meaning one or more) politicians are
not crooks. 
3. The symbol ∼is our ﬁrst example of a logical operator.
4. When we say in Quick Example 5 above that ∼(∼p) has the same meaning as p, we
mean that they are logically equivalent—a notion we will make precise below. ■
Here is another way we can form a new statement from old ones. Starting with p: “I
am wise,” and q: “I am strong,” we can form the statement “I am wise and I am strong.”
We denote this new statement by p ∧q, read “p and q.” In order for p ∧q to be true,

A.1 Statements and Logical Operators
A3
A P P E N D I X  A
both p and q must be true. Thus, for example, if I am wise but not strong, then p ∧q
is false. The symbol ∧is another logical operator. The statement p ∧q is called the
conjunction of p and q. 
quick Examples
Conjunction
The conjunction of p and q is the statement p ∧q, which we read “p and q.” It can also
be said in a number of different ways, such as “p even though q.” The statement p ∧q
is true when both p and q are true and false otherwise.
1. If p: “This galaxy will ultimately disappear into a black hole” and q: “2 + 2 = 4,”
then p ∧q is the statement “Not only will this galaxy ultimately disappear into a
black hole, but 2 + 2 = 4!”
2. If p: “2 + 2 = 4” and q: “1 = 0,” then p ∧q: “2 + 2 = 4 and 1 = 0.” Its truth value
is F because q is F.
3. With p and q as in Quick Example 1, the statement p ∧(∼q) says: “This galaxy will
ultimately disappear into a black hole and 2 + 2 ̸= 4,” or, more colorfully, as “Con-
trary to your hopes, this galaxy is doomed to disappear into a black hole; moreover,
two plus two is decidedly not equal to four!”
Notes
1. We sometimes use the word “but” as an emphatic form of “and.” For instance, if p: “It
is hot,” and q: “It is not humid,” then we can read p ∧q as “It is hot but not humid.”
There are always many ways of saying essentially the same thing in a natural lan-
guage; one of the purposes of symbolic logic is to strip away the verbiage and record
the underlying logical structure of a statement.
2. A compound statement is a statement formed from simpler statements via the use of
logical operators. Examples are ∼p, (∼p) ∧(q ∧r) and p ∧(∼p). A statement that
cannot be expressed as a compound statement is called an atomic statement.1 For
example, “I am clever” is an atomic statement. In a compound statement such as
(∼p) ∧(q ∧r), we refer to p, q and r as the variables of the statement. Thus, for ex-
ample, ∼p is a compound statement in the single variable p. ■
Before discussing other logical operators, we pause for a moment to talk about
truth tables, which give a convenient way to analyze compound statements.
1 “Atomic” comes from the Greek for “not divisible.” Atoms were originally thought to be the indivisible com-
ponents of matter, but the march of science proved that wrong. The name stuck, though.
quick Examples
Truth Table
The truth table for a compound statement shows, for each combination of possible
truth values of its variables, the corresponding truth value of the statement.
1. The truth table for negation, that is, for ∼p, is:
Each row shows a possible truth value for p and the corresponding value of ∼p.
p
∼p
T
F
F
T

Notice how we get the ∼( p ∧q) column from the p ∧q column: we reverse all the
truth values.
b. Because there are two variables, p and q, we again start with the p and q columns. We
then evaluate ∼p, and ﬁnally take the conjunction of the result with q.
A4

2. The truth table for conjunction, that is, for p ∧q, is:
Each row shows a possible combination of truth values of p and q and the corre-
sponding value of p ∧q.
Example 2 Construction of Truth Tables
Construct truth tables for the following compound statements.
a. ∼( p ∧q)
b. (∼p) ∧q
Solution
a. Whenever we encounter a complex statement, we work from the inside out, just as
we might do if we had to evaluate an algebraic expression like −(a + b). Thus, we
start with the p and q columns, then construct the p ∧q column, and ﬁnally, the
∼( p ∧q) column.

Because we are “and-ing” ∼p with q, we look at the values in the ∼p and q columns
and combine these according to the instructions for “and.” Thus, for example, in the
ﬁrst row we have F ∧T = F and in the third row we have T ∧T = T.
Here is a third logical operator. Starting with p: “You are over 18” and q: “You are
accompanied by an adult,” we can form the statement “You are over 18 or are accompa-
nied by an adult,” which we write symbolically as p ∨q, read “p or q.” Now in English
the word “or” has several possible meanings, so we have to agree on which one we want
here. Mathematicians have settled on the inclusive or: p ∨q means p is true or q is true

or both are true2. With p and q as above, p ∨q stands for “You are over 18 or are ac-
companied by an adult, or both.” We shall sometimes include the phrase “or both” for
emphasis, but even if we leave it off we still interpret “or” as inclusive.
A.1 Statements and Logical Operators
A5
A P P E N D I X  A
2 There is also the exclusive or: “p or q but not both.” This can be expressed as ( p ∨q) ∧∼( p ∧q). Do you
see why?
quick Examples
Disjunction
The disjunction of p and q is the statement p ∨q, which we read “p or q.” Its truth value
is deﬁned by the following truth table.
This is the inclusive or, so p ∨q is true when p is true or q is true or both are true.
1. Let p: “The butler did it” and let q: “The cook did it.” Then p ∨q: “Either the butler
or the cook did it.”
2. Let p: “The butler did it,” and let q: “The cook did it,” and let r: “The lawyer did it.”
Then ( p ∨q) ∧(∼r): “Either the butler or the cook did it, but not the lawyer.”

Note The only way for p ∨q to be false is for both p and q to be false. For this reason,
we can say that p ∨q also means “p and q are not both false.” ■
To introduce our next logical operator, we ask you to consider the following state-
ment: “If you earn an A in logic, then I’ll buy you a new car.” It seems to be made up out
of two simpler statements,
p: “You earn an A in logic,” and
q: “I will buy you a new car.”
The original statement says: if p is true, then q is true, or, more simply, if p, then q. We
can also phrase this as p implies q, and we write the statement symbolically as p →q.
Now let us suppose for the sake of argument that the original statement: “If you earn
an A in logic, then I’ll buy you a new car,” is true. This does not mean that you will earn an
A in logic. All it says is that if you do so, then I will buy you that car. Thinking of this as
a promise, the only way that it can be broken is if you do earn an A and I do not buy you
a new car. With this in mind, we deﬁne the logical statement p →q as follows.
Conditional
The conditional p →q, which we read “if p, then q” or “p implies q,” is deﬁned by the
following truth table:
p
q
p →q
T
T
T
T
F
F
F
T
T
F
F
T

Notes
1. The only way that p →q can be false is if p is true and q is false—this is the case of
the “broken promise” in the car example above.
2. If you look at the last two rows of the truth table, you see that we say that “p →q” is
true when p is false, no matter what the truth value of q. Think again about the
promise—if you don’t get that A, then whether or not I buy you a new car, I have not
broken my promise. It may seem strange at ﬁrst to say that F →T is T and F →F is
also T, but, as they did in choosing to say that “or” is always inclusive, mathematicians
agreed that the truth table above gives the most useful deﬁnition of the conditional. ■
It is usually misleading to think of “if p then q” as meaning that p causes q. For in-
stance, tropical weather conditions cause hurricanes, but one cannot claim that if there
are tropical weather conditions, then there are (always) hurricanes. Here is a list of some
English phrases that do have the same meaning as p →q.
A6
Appendix A
Logic
A P P E N D I X  A
quick Examples
The arrow “→” is the conditional operator, and in p →q the statement p is called the
antecedent, or hypothesis, and q is called the consequent, or conclusion. A statement
of the form p →q is also called an implication.
1. “If 1 + 1 = 2 then the sun rises in the east” has the form p →q where p: “1 + 1 = 2”
is true and q: “the sun rises in the east.” is also true. Therefore the statement is true.
2. “If the moon is made of green cheese, then I am Arnold Schwartzenegger” has the
form p →q where p is false. From the truth table, we see that p →q is therefore
true, regardless of whether or not I am Arnold Schwartzenegger.
3. “If 1 + 1 = 2 then 0 = 1” has the form p →q where this time p is true but q is false.
Therefore, by the truth table, the given statement is false.
quick Example
Some Phrasings of the Conditional
We interpret each of the following as equivalent to the conditional p →q.
If p then q.
p implies q.
q follows from p.
Not p unless q.
q if p.
p only if q.
Whenever p, q.
q whenever p.
p is sufﬁcient for q.
q is necessary for p.
p is a sufﬁcient condition for q.
q is a necessary condition for p.
“If it’s Tuesday, this must be Belgium” can be rephrased in several ways as follows:
“Its being Tuesday implies that this is Belgium.”
“This is Belgium if it’s Tuesday.”
“It’s Tuesday only if this is Belgium.”
“It can’t be Tuesday unless this is Belgium.”
“Its being Tuesday is sufﬁcient for this to be Belgium.”
“That this is Belgium is a necessary condition for its being Tuesday.”

Notice the difference between “if” and “only if.” We say that “p only if q” means
p →q because, assuming that p →q is true, p can be true only if q is also. In other
words, the only line of the truth table that has p →q true and p true also has q true. The
phrasing “p is a sufﬁcient condition for q” says that it sufﬁces to know that p is true to
be able to conclude that q is true. For example, it is sufﬁcient that you get an A in logic
for me to buy you a new car. Other things might induce me to buy you the car, but an A
in logic would sufﬁce. The phrasing “q is necessary for p” says that for p to be true, q
must be true (just as we said for “p only if q”).
Q: Does the commutative law hold for the conditional? In other words, is p →q the same as
q →p?
A: No, as we can see in the following truth table:

Converse and Contrapositive
The statement q →p is called the converse of the statement p →q. A conditional and
its converse are not the same.
The statement ∼q →∼p is the contrapositive of the statement p →q. A conditional
and its contrapositive are logically equivalent in the sense we deﬁne below: they have the
same truth value for all possible values of p and q.
Example 3 Converse and Contrapositive
Give the converse and contrapositive of the statement “If you earn an A in logic, then I’ll
buy you a new car.”
Solution This statement has the form p →q where p: “you earn an A” and q: “I’ll buy
you a new car.” The converse is q →p. In words, this is “If I buy you a new car then you
earned an A in logic.”
The contrapositive is (∼q) →(∼p). In words, this is “If I don’t buy you a new car,
then you didn’t earn an A in logic.”
Assuming that the original statement is true, notice that the converse is not neces-
sarily true. There is nothing in the original promise that prevents me from buying you a
new car if you do not earn the A. On the other hand, the contrapositive is true. If I don’t
buy you a new car, it must be that you didn’t earn an A; otherwise I would be breaking
my promise. 
■

It sometimes happens that we do want both a conditional and its converse to be true.
The conjunction of a conditional and its converse is called a biconditional.

p if and only if q.
p is necessary and sufﬁcient for q.
p is equivalent to q.
“I teach math if and only if I am paid a large sum of money.” can be rephrased in several
ways as follows:
“I am paid a large sum of money if and only if I teach math.”
“My teaching math is necessary and sufﬁcient for me to be paid a large sum of
money.”
“For me to teach math, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that I be paid a large sum of
money.”
A.2 Logical Equivalence
We mentioned above that we say that two statements are logically equivalent if for all
possible truth values of the variables involved the two statements always have the same
truth values. If s and t are equivalent, we write s ≡t. This is not another logical statement.
It is simply the claim that the two statements s and t are logically equivalent. Here are
some examples.
Example 4 Logical Equivalence
Use truth tables to show the following:
a. p ≡∼(∼p). This is called double negation.
b. ∼( p ∧q) ≡(∼p) ∨(∼q). This is one of DeMorgan’s Laws.

A.2 Logical Equivalence

a. To demonstrate the logical equivalence of these two statements, we construct a truth
table with columns for both p and ∼(∼p).

Because the p and ∼(∼p) columns contain the same truth values in all rows, the two
statements are logically equivalent.

Because the ∼( p ∧q) column and (∼p) ∨(∼q) column agree, the two statements
are equivalent.
+Before we go on... The statement ∼( p ∧q) can be read as “It is not the case that both
p and q are true” or “p and q are not both true.” We have just shown that this is equiva-
lent to “Either p is false or q is false.” ■
quick Example
DeMorgan’s Laws
If p and q are statements, then
∼( p ∧q) ≡(∼p) ∨(∼q)
∼( p ∨q) ≡(∼p) ∧(∼q)
Let p: “the President is a Democrat,” and q: “the President is a Republican.” Then the
following two statements say the same thing:
∼( p ∧q): “the President is not both a Democrat and a Republican.”
(∼p) ∨(∼q): “either the President is not a Democrat, or he is not a Republican (or
he is neither).”
Here are the two equivalences known as DeMorgan’s Laws.
Here is a list of some important logical equivalences, some of which we have already
encountered. All of them can be veriﬁed using truth tables as in Example 4. (The veriﬁ-
cations of some of these are in the exercise set.)

Note that these logical equivalences apply to any statement. The ps, qs and rs can
stand for atomic statements or compound statements, as we see in the next example.

Example 5 Applying Logical Equivalences
a. Apply DeMorgan’s law (once) to the statement ∼([p ∧(∼q)] ∧r).
b. Apply the distributive law to the statement (∼p) ∧[q ∨(∼r)].
c. Consider: “You will get an A if either you are clever and the sun shines, or you are
clever and it rains.” Rephrase the condition more simply using the distributive law.
Solution
a. We can analyze the given statement from the outside in. It is ﬁrst of all a negation, but
further, it is the negation ∼(A ∧B), where A is the compound statement [p ∧(∼q)]
and B is r:
∼(
A
∧
B)



∼( [p ∧(∼q)] ∧
r)
Now one of DeMorgan’s laws is
∼(A ∧B) ≡(∼A) ∨(∼B)
Applying this equivalence gives
∼([p ∧(∼q)] ∧r) ≡(∼[p ∧(∼q)]) ∨(∼r)
b. The given statement has the form A ∧[B ∨C], where A = (∼p), B = q, and
C = (∼r). So, we apply the distributive law A ∧[B ∨C], ≡[A ∧B] ∨[A ∧C]:
(∼p) ∧[q ∨(∼r)] ≡[(∼p) ∧q] ∨[(∼p) ∧(∼r)]
(We need not stop here: The second expression on the right is just begging for an
application of DeMorgan’s law. . .)
c. The condition is “either you are clever and the sun shines, or you are clever and it
rains.” Let’s analyze this symbolically: Let p: “You are clever,” q: “The sun shines,”

and r: “It rains.” The condition is then ( p ∧q) ∨( p ∧r). We can “factor out” the p
using one of the distributive laws in reverse, getting
( p ∧q) ∨( p ∧r) ≡p ∧(q ∨r)
We are taking advantage of the fact that the logical equivalences we listed can be
read from right to left as well as from left to right. Putting p ∧(q ∨r) back into
English, we can rephrase the sentence as “You will get an A if you are clever and
either the sun shines or it rains.”
+Before we go on... In part (a) of Example 5 we could, if we wanted, apply DeMorgan’s
law again, this time to the statement ∼[p ∧(∼q)] that is part of the answer. Doing so gives 
∼[p ∧(∼q)] ≡(∼p) ∨∼(∼q) ≡(∼p) ∨q
Notice that we’ve also used the double negative law. Therefore, the original expression
can be simpliﬁed as follows:
∼([p ∧(∼q)] ∧r) ≡(∼[p ∧(∼q)]) ∨(∼r) ≡((∼p) ∨q) ∨(∼r)
which we can write as
(∼p) ∨q ∨(∼r)
because the associative law tells us that it does not matter which two expressions we
“or” ﬁrst. ■
quick Examples
Tautologies and Contradictions
A compound statement is a tautology if its truth value is always T, regardless of the truth
values of its variables. It is a contradiction if its truth value is always F, regardless of the
truth values of its variables.
1. p ∨(∼p) has truth table 
and is therefore a tautology.
2. p ∧(∼p) has truth table 
and is therefore a contradiction.

When a statement is a tautology, we also say that the statement is tautological. In
common usage this sometimes means simply that the statement is self-evident. In logic
it means something stronger: that the statement is always true, under all circumstances.
In contrast, a contradiction, or contradictory statement, is never true, under any cir-
cumstances.
Some of the most important tautologies are the tautological implications, tautolo-
gies that have the form of implications. We look at two of them: Direct Reasoning, and
Indirect Reasoning:

quick Example
Note You can check that the statement [( p →q) ∧p] →q is a tautology by drawing
its truth table. ■
Tautological implications are useful mainly because they allow us to check the validity
of arguments.
quick Examples
Argument
An argument is a list of statements called premises followed by a statement called the
conclusion. If the premises are P1, P2, . . . , Pn and the conclusion is C, then we say that
the argument is valid if the statement (P1 ∧P2 ∧. . . ∧Pn) →C is a tautology. In other
words, an argument is valid if the truth of all its premises logically implies the truth of
its conclusion.
1. The following is a valid argument:
p →q
p
...
q
(This is the traditional way of writing an argument: We list the premises above a line
and then put the conclusion below; the symbol “...” stands for the word “therefore.”)
This argument is valid because the statement [( p →q) ∧p] →q is a tautology,
namely modus ponens.
2. The following is an invalid argument:
p →q
q
...
p
The argument is invalid because the statement [( p →q) ∧q] →p is not a tautology. In
fact, if p is F and q is T, then the whole statement is F.
Modus Ponens or Direct Reasoning
The following tautology is called modus ponens or direct reasoning:
[( p →q) ∧p] →q
In Words 
If an implication and its antecedent ( p) are both true, then so is its consequent (q).
If my loving math implies that I will pass this course, and if I do love math, then I will
pass this course.

The argument in Quick Example 2 above is known as the fallacy of afﬁrming the
consequent. It is a common invalid argument and not always obviously ﬂawed at ﬁrst
sight, so is often exploited by advertisers. For example, consider the following claim:
All Olympic athletes drink Boors, so you should too. The suggestion is that, if you drink
Boors, you will be an Olympic athlete:
If you are an Olympic Athlete you drink Boors.
Premise (Let’s pretend this is True)
You drink Boors.
Premise (True)
...
You are an Olympic Athlete.
Conclusion (May be false!)
This is an error that Boors hopes you will make!
There is, however, a correct argument in which we deny the consequent:

Modus Tollens or Indirect Reasoning
The following tautology is called modus tollens or indirect reasoning:

If an implication is true but its consequent (q) is false, then its antecedent ( p) is false.
In Argument Form

If my loving math implies that I will pass this course, and if I do not pass the course, then
it must be the case that I do not love math.
In argument form:
If I love math, then I will pass this course.
I will not pass the course.
Therefore, I do not love math. 
Note This argument is not as direct as modus ponens; it contains a little twist: “If I
loved math I would pass this course. However, I will not pass this course. Therefore, it
must be that I don’t love math (else I would pass this course).” Hence the name “indirect
reasoning.”
Note that, again, there is a similar, but fallacious argument to avoid, for instance: “If
I were an Olympic athlete then I would drink Boors ( p →q). However, I am not an
Olympic athlete (∼p). Therefore, I won’t drink Boors. (∼q).” This is a mistake Boors
certainly hopes you do not make! ■
There are other interesting tautologies that we can use to justify arguments. We
mention one more and refer the interested reader to the website for more examples and

49. As the text reminds us: to
evaluate f of a quantity (such as x + h) replace x everywhere by
the whole quantity x + h, getting f (x + h) = (x + h)2 −1.

35. True. We can construct a table of values from any graph by
reading off a set of values.
37. False. In a numerically speciﬁed
function, only certain values of the function are speciﬁed, giving
only certain points on the graph.
39. They are different por-
tions of the graph of the associated equation y = f (x).
41. The
graph of g(x) is the same as the graph of f (x), but shifted 5 units
to the right.

the same number, then the values in the table come from a linear 
function.
73. f (x) = −a
b x + c
b . If b = 0, thena
b is undeﬁned,
and y cannot be specified as a function of x. (The graph of the
resulting equation would be a vertical line.)
75. slope, 3
77. If m is positive then y will increase as x increases; if m is
negative then y will decrease as x increases; if m is zero then y
will not change as x changes.
79. The slope increases, since an
increase in the y-coordinate of the second point increases y
while leaving x ﬁxed.

ANSWER
67. (A)
69. The inverse does not exist—the ma-
trix is singular. (If two rows of a matrix are the same, then row re-
ducing it will lead to a row of zeros, and so it cannot be reduced
to the identity.)
73. When one or more of the di are zero. If that
is the case, then the matrix [D | I ] easily reduces to a matrix that
has a row of zeros on the left-hand portion, so that D is singular,
Conversely, if none of the di are zero, then  [D | I] easily reduces
to a matrix of the form [I | E ], showing that D is invertible.
75. (AB)(B−1 A−1) = A(BB−1)A−1 = AI A−1 = AA−1 = I
77. If A has an inverse, then every system of equations AX = B
has a unique solution, namely X = A−1B. But if A reduces to a
matrix with a row of zeros, then such a system has either inﬁnitely
many solutions or no solution at all.

51. Allocate 1/7 of the budget

mately $2860.
53. Like a saddle point in a payoff matrix, the
center of a saddle is a low point (minimum height) in one direction
and a high point (maximum) in a perpendicular direction.
55. Although there is a saddle point in the 2,4 position, you would
be wrong to use saddle points (based on the minimax criterion) to
reach the conclusion that row strategy 2 is best. One reason is that
the entries in the matrix do not represent payoffs, because high
numbers of employees in an area do not necessarily represent bene-
ﬁt to the row player. Another reason for this is that there is no
opponent deciding what your job will be in such a way as to force
you into the least populated job.
57. If you strictly alternate the
two strategies the column player will know which pure strategy you
will play on each move, and can choose a pure strategy
accordingly. For example, consider the game 
a
b
A
B
 1
0

1
 . By
the analysis of Example 3 (or the symmetry of the game), the best
strategy for the row player is [0.5 0.5] and the best strategy for
the column player is [0.5 0.5]T . This gives an expected value of
0.5 for the game. However, suppose that the row player alternates
A and B strictly and that the column player catches on to this.
Then, whenever the row player plays A the column player will
play b and whenever the row player plays B the column player will
play a. This gives a payoff of 0 each time, worse for the row player
than the expected value of 0.5.

product or the product of any other sector.
31. It would mean
that all of the output of that sector was used internally in the
economy; none of the output was available for export and no
importing was necessary.
33. It means that an increase in
demand for one sector (the column sector) has no effect on the
production of another sector (the row sector).
35. Usually, to
produce one unit of one sector requires less than one unit of input
from another. We would expect then that an increase in demand
of one unit for one sector would require a smaller increase in
production in another sector.

Maximize proﬁt p = 2x + y subject to x ≥0, y ≥0. Then p can
be made as large as we like by choosing large values of x and/or
y. Thus there is no optimal solution to the problem.
55. Mathe-
matically, this means that there are inﬁnitely many possible solu-
tions: one for each point along the line joining the two corner
points in question. In practice, select those points with integer so-
lutions (because x and y must be whole numbers in this problem)
that are in the feasible region and close to this line, and choose the
one that gives the largest proﬁt.

47. The graphical method applies only to LP problems in two un-
knowns, whereas the simplex method can be used to solve LP
problems with any number of unknowns.
49. She is correct.
Because there are only two constraints, there can only be two ac-
tive variables, giving two or fewer nonzero values for the un-
knowns at each stage.
51. A basic solution to a system of linear
equations is a solution in which all the non-pivotal variables are
taken to be zero; that is, all variables whose values are arbitrary
are assigned the value zero. To obtain a basic solution for a given
system of linear equations, one can row reduce the associated
augmented matrix, write down the general solution, and then set
all the parameters (variables with “arbitrary” values) equal to
zero.
53. No. Let us assume for the sake of simplicity that all
the pivots are 1’s. (They may certainly be changed to 1’s without
affecting the value of any of the variables.) Because the entry at
the bottom of the pivot column is negative, the bottom row gets
replaced by itself plus a positive multiple of the pivot row. The
value of the objective function (bottom-right entry) is thus re-
placed by itself plus a positive multiple of the nonnegative right-
most entry of the pivot row. Therefore, it cannot decrease.

37. P = 500 + 46t (t = time in years since 1950) Graph:
39. Graph (A) is the only possible choice, because the equation
FV = PV(1 + rt) = PV + PVrt gives the future value as a
linear function of time.
41. Wrong. In simple interest growth,
the change each year is a ﬁxed percentage of the starting value,
and not the preceding year’s value. (Also see Exercise 42.)
43. Simple interest is always calculated on a constant amount,
PV. If interest is paid into your account, then the amount on which
interest is calculated does not remain constant.

59. No. Compound
interest increase is exponential. The graph looks roughly exponen-
tial in that period, but to really tell we can compare interest 
rates between marked points to see if the rate remained roughly
constant: From December 1997 to August 1999 the rate was
(16.31/3.28)12/20 −1 = 1.6179 or 161.79%, while from August
1999 to March 2000 the rate was (33.95/16.31)12/7 −1 = 2.5140
or 251.40%. These rates are quite different.

67. The function y = P(1 + r/m)mx is not a linear
function of x, but an exponential function. Thus, its graph is not a
straight line.
69. Wrong. Its growth is exponential and can be
modeled by 0.01(1.10)t.
71. The graphs are the same because
the formulas give the same function of x; a compound-interest in-
vestment behaves as though it was being compounded once a year
at the effective rate.
73. The effective rate exceeds the nominal
rate when the interest is compounded more than once a year because
then interest is being paid on interest accumulated during each year,
resulting in a larger effective rate. Conversely, if the interest is com-
pounded less often than once a year, the effective rate is less than the
nominal rate.
75. Compare their future values in constant dollars.
The investment with the larger future value is the better investment.
77. The graphs are approaching a particular curve as m gets larger,
approximately the curve given by the largest two values of m.

57. He is wrong because his estimate ignores the interest that
will be earned by your annuity—both while it is increasing and
while it is decreasing. Your payments will be considerably smaller
(depending on the interest earned).
59. He is not correct. For
instance, the payments on a $100,000 10-year mortgage at 12%
are $1434.71, while for a 20-year mortgage at the same rate,
they are $1101.09, which is a lot more than half the 10-year
mortgage payment.

and C = {1, 2}. Then (A ∩B) ∪C = {1, 2}
but
A ∩(B ∪C) = {1}. In general, A ∩(B ∪C) must be a subset of
A, but (A ∩B) ∪C need not be; also, (A ∩B) ∪C must contain
C as a subset, but A ∩(B ∪C) need not.
77. A universal set is
a set containing all “things” currently under consideration. When

heads, because heads comes up approximately 58% of the time.
On the other hand, it is conceivable that the coin is fair and that
heads came up 58% of the time purely by chance. Deciding which

55. Wrong. For example, the theoretical probability of winning
a state lotto is small but nonzero. However, the vast majority of
people who play lotto day of their lives never win, no matter how
frequently they play.
57. When A ∩B = ∅we have
P(A ∩B) = P(∅) = 0, so P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −
P(A ∩B) = P(A) + P(B) −0 = P(A) + P(B).
59. Zero.
According to the assumption, no matter how many thunder-
storms occur, lightning cannot strike your favorite spot more
than once, and so, after n trials the estimated probability will
never exceed 1/n, and so will approach zero as the number of
trials gets large.

45. The four outcomes listed
are not equally likely; for example, (red, blue) can occur in four
ways. The methods of this section yield a probability for (red,
blue) of C(2, 2)/C(4, 2) = 1/6
47. No. If we do not pay atten-
tion to order, the probability is C(5, 2)/C(9, 2) = 10/36 = 5/18. 
If we do pay attention to order, the probability is 
P(5, 2)/P(9, 2) = 20/72 = 5/18 again. The difference 
between permutations and combinations cancels when we 
compute the probability.

83. The fraction of times E occurs
85. Wrong. For a pair of
fair dice, the theoretical probability of a pair of matching num-
bers is 1/6, as Ruth says. However, it is quite possible, although
not very likely, that if you cast a pair of fair dice 20 times, you
will never obtain a matching pair (in fact, there is approximately
a 2.6% chance that this will happen). In general, a nontrivial
claim about theoretical probability can never be absolutely
validated or refuted experimentally. All we can say is that the
evidence suggests that the dice are not fair.
87. For a (large)
number of days, record the temperature prediction for the next
day and then check the actual temperature the next day. Record
whether the prediction was accurate (within, say, 2◦F of the
actual temperature). The fraction of times the prediction was
accurate is the estimated probability.
89. He is wrong. It is
possible to have a run of losses of any length. Tony may have

91. Answers will vary. Here is a simple one: E: the ﬁrst toss is a
head, F: the second toss is a head, G: the third toss is a head.
93. The probability you seek is P(E | F), or should be. If, for
example, you were going to place a wager on whether E occurs
or not, it is crucial to know that the sample space has been re-
duced to F (you know that F did occur). If you base your wager
on P(E) rather than P(E | F) you will misjudge your 
likelihood of winning.
95. If A ⊆B then A ∩B = A,
so P(A ∩B) = P(A) and P(A | B) = P(A ∩B)/P(B) =
P(A)/P(B).
97. Your friend is correct. If A and B are
mutually exclusive then P(A ∩B) = 0. On the other hand, if A
and B are independent then P(A ∩B) = P(A)P(B). Thus,
P(A)P(B) = 0. If a product is 0 then one of the factors must be
0, so either P(A) = 0 or P(B) = 0. Thus, it cannot be true that A
and B are mutually exclusive, have nonzero probabilities, and are
independent all at the same time.
99. P(A′ ∩B′) =
1 −P(A ∪B) = 1 −[P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B)] =
1 −[P(A) + P(B) −P(A)P(B)] = (1 −P(A))(1 −P(B)) =
P(A′)P(B′).

37. Suppose that the steroid test gives 10%
false negatives and that only 0.1% of the tested population uses
steroids. Then the probability that an athlete uses steroids, given
that he or she has tested positive, is  
(.9)(.001)
(.9)(.001) + (.01)(.999) ≈.083.
39. Draw a tree in which the 
ﬁrst branching shows which of R1, R2, or R3 occurred, and the
second branching shows which of T or T ′ then occurred. There
are three ﬁnal outcomes in which T occurs: 
P(R1 ∩T) = P(T | R1) P(R1), P(R2 ∩T) = P(T | R2)P(R2),
and P(R3 ∩T) = P(T | R3)P(R3). In only one of these, the
ﬁrst, does R1 occur. Thus, 
P(R1 | T) = P(R1 ∩T)
P(T)
=
P(T | R1)P(R1)
P(T | R1)P(R1) + P(T | R2)P(R2) + P(T | R3)P(R3)

41. The reasoning is ﬂawed. Let A be the event that a Democrat
agrees with Saﬁre’s column, and let F and M be the events that a
Democrat reader is female and male respectively. Then A. D.
makes the following argument: 
P(M | A) = 0.9, P(F | A′) = 0.9. Therefore, P(A | M) = 0.9.
According to Bayes’Theorem we cannot conclude anything about
P(A | M) unless we know P(A), the percentage of all Democrats
who agreed with Saﬁre’s column. This was not given.

57. There are two assumptions made
by Markov systems that may not be true about the stock market:
the assumption that the transition probabilities do not change
over time, and the assumption that the transition probability
depends only on the current state.
59. If q is a row of Q, then
by assumption qP = q. Thus, when we multiply the rows of Q by
P, nothing changes, and QP = Q.
61. At each step, only 0.4
of the population in state 1 remains there, and nothing enters
from any other state. Thus, when the ﬁrst entry in the steady-
state distribution vector is multiplied by 0.4 it must remain
unchanged. The only number for which this true is 0.
63. An example is
65. If vP = v and wP = w, then 1
2(v + w)P =
1
2vP + 1
2wP = 1
2v + 1
2w = 1
2(v + w). Further, if the entries of
v and w add up to 1, then so do the entries of (v + w)/2.

number of days a diligent student waits before beginning to study
for an exam scheduled in 10 days’ time.
59. Answers may vary.
If we are interested in exact page-counts, then the number of pos-
sible values is very large and the values are (relatively speaking)
close together, so using a continuous random variable might be
advantageous. In general, the ﬁner and more numerous the mea-
surement classes, the more likely it becomes that a continuous
random variable could be advantageous.

Because there is only a 2.66% chance of detecting the disease in a
given year, the government’s claim seems dubious.
47. No; in a
sequence of Bernoulli trials, the occurrence of one success does
not affect the probability of success on the next attempt.
49. No;
if life is a sequence of Bernoulli trials, then the occurrence of one
misfortune (“success”) does not affect the probability of a misfor-
tune on the next trial. Hence, misfortunes may very well not
“occur in threes.”
51. The probability of selecting a red marble
changes after each selection, as the number of marbles left in the
bag decreases. This violates the requirement that, in a sequence of
Bernoulli trials, the probability of “success” does not change.

P(X > µ) = .58, and is thus larger. Most supermarkets have

is wrong; for example, the collection 0, 0, 300 has mean 100 and
median 0.
61. No. The expected number of times you will hit
the dart-board is the average number of times you will hit the
bull’s eye per 50 shots; the average of a set of whole numbers need
not be a whole number.
63. Wrong. It might be the case that
only a small fraction of people in the class scored better than you
but received exceptionally high scores that raised the class aver-
age. Suppose, for instance, that there are 10 people in the class.
Four received 100%, you received 80%, and the rest received
70%. Then the class average is 83%, 5 people have lower scores
than you, but only four have higher scores.
65. No; the mean of
a very large sample is only an estimate of the population mean.
The means of larger and larger samples approach the population
mean as the sample size increases.
67. Wrong. The statement at-
tributed to President Bush asserts that the mean tax refund would
be $1000, whereas the statements referred to as “The Truth” sug-
gest that the median tax refund would be close to $100 (and that
the 31st percentile would be zero).

21. 1985 (t = 15); 3525 pounds
23. 5000 pounds. The model is not trustworthy for vehicle
weights larger than 5000 pounds, because it predicts increasing
fuel economy with increasing weight, and 5000 is close to
the upper limit of the domain of the function.
25. Maximum revenue when p = $140, R = $9800
27. Maximum revenue with 70 houses, R = $9,800,000
29. a. q = −560x + 1400; R = −560x2 + 1400x
b. P = −560x2 + 1400x −30; x = $1.25; P = $845 per month
31. C = −200x + 620; P = −400x2 + 1400x −620

c. C = −30p + 4200
d. P = −10p2 + 430p −4200; p = $21.50
35. C(t) = 2.7t2 −4.5t + 50; $120.2 billion, which agrees
with the actual value to the nearest $1 billion.
37. a. S(t) = −12.27t2 + 227.23t + 64.39
b. 986,000 units c. Mathematical regression cannot reliably be
used to make predictions about sales. (Answers will vary.)
39. The x-coordinate of the vertex represents the unit price that
leads to the maximum revenue, the y-coordinate of the vertex
gives the maximum possible revenue, the x-intercepts give the
unit prices that result in zero revenue, and the y-intercept gives the
revenue resulting from zero unit price (which is obviously zero).
41. Graph the data to see whether the points suggest a curve
rather than a straight line. If the curve suggested by the graph is
concave up or concave down, then a quadratic model would be a
likely candidate.
43. If q = mp + b (with m < 0), then the rev-
enue is given by R = pq = mp2 + bp. This is the equation of a
parabola with a = m < 0, and so is concave down. Thus the ver-
tex is the highest point on the parabola, showing that there is a
single highest value for R, namely, the y-coordinate of the vertex.
45. Because R = pq, the demand must be given by
q = R
p = −50p2 + 60p
p
= −50p + 60.

101. Linear functions better: cost models
where there is a ﬁxed cost and a variable cost; simple interest,
where interest is paid on the original amount invested. Exponen-

Review written by researchers in Europe approaches 7000 per year.
33. 470. This suggests that students whose parents earn an
exceptionally large income score an average of 470 on the SAT
verbal test.
35. limt→1−C(t) = 0.06, limt→1+ C(t) = 0.08, 
so limt→1 C(t) does not exist.
37. limt→+∞I (t) = +∞, 
limt→+∞(I (t)/E(t)) ≈2.5. In the long term, U.S. imports from
China will rise without bound and be 2.5 times U.S. exports to
China. In the real world, imports and exports cannot rise without
bound. Thus, the given models should not be extrapolated far into
the future.
39. limt→+∞n(t) ≈80. Online book sales can be ex-
pected to level off at 80 million per year in the long term.
41. To
approximate limx→a f (x) numerically, choose values of x closer
and closer to, and on either side of x = a, and evaluate f (x) for
each of them. The limit (if it exists) is then the number that these
values of f (x) approach. A disadvantage of this method is that it
may never give the exact value of the limit, but only an approxima-
tion. (However, we can make this as accurate as we like.)
43. It is
possible for limx→a f (x) to exist even though 
f (a) is not deﬁned. An example is lim
x→1
x2 −3x + 2
x −1
.
45. Any situation in which there is a sudden change can be mod-
eled by a function in which limt→a+ f (t) is not the same as
limt→a−f (t) One example is the value of a stock market index

33. Not unless
the domain of the function consists of all real numbers. (It is
impossible for a function to be continuous at points not in its do-
main.) For example, f (x) = 1/x is continuous on its domain—
the set of nonzero real numbers—but not at x = 0.
35. True. If
the graph of a function has a break in its graph at any point a, then
it cannot be continuous at the point a.

51. a. 0.49, 1.16. Shortly before 1999, annual advertis-
ing expenditures were close to $0.49 billion. Shortly after 1999,
annual advertising expenditures were close to $1.16 billion. 
b. Not continuous; Movie advertising expenditures jumped sud-
denly in 1999.

55. limt→+∞I (t) = +∞,
limt→+∞(I (t)/E(t)) = 2.5. In the long term, U.S. imports from
China will rise without bound and be 2.5 times U.S. exports to
China. In the real world, imports and exports cannot rise without
bound. Thus, the given models should not be extrapolated far into
the future.
57. limt→+∞p(t) = 100. The percentage of chil-
dren who learn to speak approaches 100% as their age increases.
59. Yes; limt→8−C(t) = limt→8+ C(t) = 1.24.
61. To evalu-
ate limx→a f (x) algebraically, ﬁrst check whether f (x) is a
closed-form function. Then check whether x = a is in its domain.
If so, the limit is just f (a); that is, it is obtained by substituting
x = a. If not, then try to ﬁrst simplify f (x) in such a way as to
transform it into a new function such that x = a is in its domain,
and then substitute. A disadvantage of this method is that it is
sometimes extremely difﬁcult to evaluate limits algebraically, and
rather sophisticated methods are often needed.
63. She is
wrong. Closed-form functions are continuous only at points in
their domains, and x = 2 is not in the domain of the closed-form
function f (x) = 1/(x −2)2.
65. The statement may not be
true, for instance, if f (x) =
 x + 2
if x < 0
2x −1
if x ≥0 , then f (0) is
deﬁned and equals −1, and yet limx→0 f (x) does not exist. The
statement can be corrected by requiring that f be a closed-form
function: “If f is a closed form function, and f (a) is deﬁned, then
limx→a f (x) exists and equals f (a).”

P′(x) = 0 when x = 2000. Thus, at a production level of 2000,
the proﬁt is stationary (neither increasing nor decreasing) with
respect to the production level. This may indicate a maximum
proﬁt at a production level of 2000.

9. a. C′(x) = 2250 −0.04x. The cost is going up at a rate of
$2,249,840 per television commercial. The exact cost of airing
the ﬁfth television commercial is C(5) −C(4) = $2,249,820.
b. ¯C(x) = 150/x + 2250 −0.02x; ¯C(4) = $2,287,420 per tele-
vision commercial. The average cost of airing the ﬁrst four televi-

b. Revenue:

Marginal revenue: $0.90, Marginal proﬁt: −$0.20. The total
revenue from the sale of 500 copies is $450. The proﬁt from the
production and sale of 500 copies is $80. Approximate revenue
from the sale of the 501st copy is 90¢. Approximate loss from
the sale of the 501st copy is 20¢. c. x = 400. The proﬁt is a

c. R(400) = $1000. This is the monthly revenue that will result
from setting the price at $2.50 per pound. R′(400) = −$1.25 per
pound of tuna. Thus, at a demand level of 400 pounds per month,
the revenue is decreasing at a rate of $1.25 per pound.
d. The
ﬁshery should raise the price (to reduce the demand).
19. P′(50) = $350. This means that, at an employment level
of 50 workers, the ﬁrm’s daily proﬁt will increase at a rate of
$350 per additional worker it hires.

b. C′(3) ≈$1,570,000 per spot, 
¯C(3) ≈$1,710,000 per spot. The average cost will decrease as x
increases.
25. a. C′(q) = 200q; C′(10) = $2000
per 
one-
pound 
reduction 
in 
emissions. b. S′(q) = 500. 
Thus
S′(q) = C′(q) when 500 = 200q, or q = 2.5 pounds per day
reduction. c. N(q) = C(q) −S(q) = 100q2 −500q + 4000.
This is a parabola with lowest point (vertex) given by q = 2.5.
The net cost at this production level is N(2.5) = $3375 per day.
The value of q is the same as that for part (b). The net cost to the
ﬁrm is minimized at the reduction level for which the cost of con-
trolling emissions begins to increase faster than the subsidy. This
is why we get the answer by setting these two rates of increase equal
to each other.
27. M′(10) ≈0.0002557 mpg/mph. This means
that, at a speed of 10 mph, the fuel economy is increasing at a rate
of 0.0002557 miles per gallon per 1-mph increase in speed.
M′(60) = 0 mpg/mph. This means that, at a speed of 60 mph, the
fuel economy is neither increasing nor decreasing with increasing
speed. M′(70) ≈−0.00001799. This means that, at 70 mph, the
fuel economy is decreasing at a rate of 0.00001799 miles per
gallon per 1-mph increase in speed. Thus 60 mph is the most fuel-
efﬁcient speed for the car.

35. Cost is often measured as a function of the number of items
x. Thus, C(x) is the cost of producing (or purchasing, as the case
may be) x items. a. The average cost function ¯C(x) is given by
¯C(x) = C(x)/x. The marginal cost function is the derivative,
C′(x), of the cost function. b. The average cost ¯C(r) is the slope
of the line through the origin and the point on the graph where
x = r. The marginal cost of the rth unit is the slope of the tangent
to the graph of the cost function at the point where x = r. c. The
average cost function ¯C(x) gives the average cost of producing
the ﬁrst x items. The marginal cost function C′(x) is the rate at
which cost is changing with respect to the number of items x, or
the incremental cost per item, and approximates the cost of pro-
ducing the (x + 1)st item.
37. The marginal cost
39. Not
necessarily. For example, it may be the case that the marginal cost
of the 101st item is larger than the average cost of the ﬁrst 100
items (even though the marginal cost is decreasing). Thus, adding
this additional item will raise the average cost.
41. The circum-
stances described suggest that the average cost function is at a rel-
atively low point at the current production level, and so it would
be appropriate to advise the company to maintain current produc-
tion levels; raising or lowering the production level will result in
increasing average costs.

This means that, at a speed of 10 mph, the fuel economy is

increase in speed. M′(60) = 0 mpg/mph. This means that, at a
speed of 60 mph, the fuel economy is neither increasing nor
decreasing with increasing speed. M′(70) ≈−0.0540. This
means that, at 70 mph, the fuel economy is decreasing at a rate of
0.0540 miles per gallon per one mph increase in speed. 60 mph is

87. The analysis is suspect, because it seems to be assert-
ing that the annual increase in revenue, which we can think of as
d R/dt, is the product of the annual increases, dp/dt in price, and
dq/dt in sales. However, because R = pq, the product rule im-
plies that d R/dt is not the product of dp/dt and dq/dt, but is 
instead d R

89. Answers will vary; 
q = −p + 1000 is one example.
91. Mine; it is increasing
twice as fast as yours. The rate of change of revenue is given by
R′(t) = p′(t)q(t) because q′(t) = 0 Thus, R′(t) does not depend
on the selling price p(t).

the quantity, times the derivative of the quantity, times ln 3.
Thus, the correct answer is 32x2 ln 3.
115. No. If N(t) is
exponential, so is its derivative.
117. If f (x) = ekx, then the 
fractional rate of change is f ′(x)
f (x) = kekx
ekx = k , the fractional 
growth rate.
119. If A(t) is growing exponentially, then
A(t) = A0ekt for constants A0 and k. Its percentage rate of
change is then 
A′(t)
A(t) = k A0ekt
A0ekt = k , a constant.

s=3
= −21.494. Thus, for a ﬁrm with annual sales 
of $3 million, the rate at which new patents are produced de-
creases with increasing ﬁrm size. This means that the returns (as
measured in the number of new patents per increase of $1 million
in sales) are diminishing as the ﬁrm size increases.
b. d2n

= 13.474. Thus, for a ﬁrm with annual sales of $7 
million, the rate at which new patents are produced increases with
increasing ﬁrm size by 13.474 new patents per $1 million increase
in annual sales. c. There is a point of inﬂection when s ≈5.4587,
so that in a ﬁrm with sales of $5,458,700 per year, the number of
new patents produced per additional $1 million in sales is a
minimum.

91. At a point of inﬂection, the graph of a function changes either
from concave up to concave down, or vice versa. If it changes
from concave up to concave down, then the derivative changes
from increasing to decreasing, and hence has a relative maximum.
Similarly, if it changes from concave down to concave up, the
derivative has a relative minimum.

17. E ≈0.77. At a family income level of $20,000, the fraction of

The demand for computers is increasing by 0.46% per one per-
cent increase in household income. b. E decreases as income
increases. c. Unreliable; it predicts a likelihood greater than 1 at
incomes of $123,000 and above. In a more appropriate model,

21. Y
Q · dQ
dY = β . An increase in income of x% will 
result in an increase in demand of βx%. (Note that we do not
take the negative here, because we expect an increase in income
to produce an increase in demand.)
23. a. q = 1000e−0.30p
b. At p = $3, E = 0.9; at p = $4, E = 1.2; at p = $5,
E = 1.5 c. p = $3.33 d. p = $5.36. Selling at a lower 
price would increase demand, but you cannot sell more than
200 pounds anyway. You should charge as much as you can and
still be able to sell all 200 pounds.
25. The price is lowered.
27. Start with R = pq, and differentiate with respect to p to 
obtain d R
dp = q + p dq
dp . For a stationary point, d R/dp = 0, and
so q + p dq
dp = 0. Rearranging this result gives p dq
dp = −q , and
hence −dq
dp · p
q = 1, or E = 1, showing that stationary points of
R correspond to points of unit elasticity.
29. The distinction is
best illustrated by an example. Suppose that q is measured in
weekly sales and p is the unit price in dollars. Then the quantity
−dq/dp measures the drop in weekly sales per $1 increase in
price. The elasticity of demand E, on the other hand, measures the
percentage drop in sales per one percent increase in price. Thus,
−dq/dp measures absolute change, while E measures fractional,
or percentage, change.

27. For maximum
revenue, the company should charge $22.14 per copy. At this
price, the cost is decreasing at a linear rate with increasing price,
while the revenue is not decreasing (its derivative is zero). Thus,
the proﬁt is increasing with increasing price, suggesting that the
maximum proﬁt will occur at a higher price.

( f (x) + g(x)) dx is, by deﬁnition, an
antiderivative of f (x) + g(x). Let F(x) be an antiderivative of
f (x) and let G(x) be an antiderivative of g(x). Then, because the
derivative of F(x) + G(x) is f (x) + g(x) (by the rule for sums
of derivatives), this means that F(x) + G(x) is an antiderivative
of f (x) + g(x). In symbols,

79. None; the substitution u = x simply replaces
the letter x throughout by the letter u, and thus does not change the
integral at all. For instance, the integral 

x(3x2 + 1) dx becomes

u(3u2 + 1) du if we substitute u = x.
81. The purpose of
substitution is to introduce a new variable that is deﬁned in terms
of the variable of integration. One cannot say u = u2 + 1, be-
cause u is not a new variable. Instead, deﬁne w = u2 + 1 (or any
other letter different from u). 83. The integral

required. The result gives us a formula, in terms of area, for an
antiderivative of any continuous function.

35. The claim is wrong because the area under a curve
can only represent income if the curve is a graph of income per
unit time. The value of a stock price is not income per unit time—
the income can only be realized when the stock is sold, and it
amounts to the current market price. The total net income (per
share) from the given investment would be the stock price on the
date of sale minus the purchase price of $40.

b. The 24-month moving average is constant and equal to the
year-long average of approximately 77°. c. A quadratic model
could not be used to predict temperatures beyond the given
12-month period, since temperature patterns are periodic,
whereas parabolas are not.
43. The moving average “blurs”
the effects of short-term oscillations in the price, and shows the
longer-term trend of the stock price.
45. The area above the
x-axis equals the area below the x-axis. Example: y = x on
[−1, 1]
47. This need not be the case; for instance, the function
f (x) = x2 on [0, 1] has average value 1/3, whereas the value
midway between the maximum and minimum is 1/2.
49. (C). A shorter term moving average most closely approxi-
mates the original function, since it averages the function over a
shorter period, and continuous functions change by only a small
amount over a small period.

41. a. The graph is a plane with x-intercept −40, y-intercept
−60, and z-intercept 240,000. b. The slice x = 10 is the
straight line with equation z = 300,000 + 4000y. It describes
the cost function for the manufacture of trucks if car production
is held ﬁxed at 10 cars per week. c. The level curve
z = 480,000 is the straight line 6000x + 4000y = 240,000.
It describes the number of cars and trucks you can manufacture
to maintain weekly costs at $480,000.
43. The graph is a plane
with x1-intercept 0.3, x2-intercept 33, and x3-intercept 0.66. The
slices by x1 = constant are straight lines that are parallel to each
other. Thus, the rate of change of General Motors’ share as a
function of Ford’s share does not depend on Chrysler’s share.
Speciﬁcally, GM’s share decreases by 0.02 percentage points
per 1 percentage-point increase in Ford’s market share, regardless
of Chrysler’s share.
45. a. The slices x = constant and
y = constant are straight lines. b. No. Even though the slices
x = constant and y = constant are straight lines, the level curves
are not, and so the surface is not a plane. c. The slice x = 10
has a slope of 3800. The slice x = 20 has a slope of 3600. Man-
ufacturing more cars lowers the marginal cost of manufacturing
trucks.
47. Both level curves are quarter-circles. (We see only
the portion in the ﬁrst quadrant because e ≥0 and k ≥0.) The
level curve C = 30,000 represents the relationship between the
number of electricians and the number of carpenters used in
building a home that costs $30,000. Similarly for the level curve
C = 40,000.
49. The following ﬁgure shows several level
curves together with several lines of the form h + w = c.
From the ﬁgure, thinking of the curves as contours on a map, we
see that the largest value of A anywhere along any of the lines
h + w = c occurs midway along the line, when h = w. Thus,
the largest area rectangle with a ﬁxed perimeter occurs when
h = w (that is, when the rectangle is a square).

51. The level curve at z = 3 has the form 3 = x0.5y0.5, or
y = 9/x, and shows the relationship between the number
of workers and the operating budget at a production level of
3 units.
53. The level curve at z = 0 consists of the nonnegative y-axis
(x = 0) and tells us that zero utility corresponds to zero copies
of Macro Publish, regardless of the number of copies of Turbo
Publish. (Zero copies of Turbo Publish does not necessarily
result in zero utility, according to the formula.)
55. Plane
57. Agree: any slice through a plane is a straight line.
59. The graph of a function of three or more variables lives in
four-dimensional (or higher) space, which makes it difﬁcult to
draw and visualize.
63. We need one dimension for each of the
variables plus one dimension for the value of the function.

41. ∂C/∂x = 6000, the marginal cost to manufac-
ture each car is $6000. ∂C/∂y = 4000, the marginal cost to

51. The marginal cost of cars
is $6000 + 1,000e−0.01(x+y) per car. The marginal cost of trucks

¯Cx(50, 50) = −$2.64 per car. This means that at a production
level of 50 cars and 50 trucks per week, the average cost per
vehicle is decreasing by $2.64 for each additional car manufac-
tured. ¯Cy(50, 50) = −$22.64 per truck. This means that at a
production level of 50 cars and 50 trucks per week, the average
cost per vehicle is decreasing by $22.64 for each additional truck
manufactured.
55. No; your marginal revenue from the sale of
cars is $15,000 −
2,500
√x + y per car and $10,000 −
2,500
√x + y per 
truck from the sale of trucks. These increase with increasing x
and y. In other words, you will earn more revenue per vehicle
with increasing sales, and so the rental company will pay more
for each additional vehicle it buys.
57. Pz(10,100,000, 1,000,000) ≈0.0001010 papers/$
59. Ux(10, 5) = 5.18, Uy(10, 5) = 2.09. This means that, if
10 copies of Macro Publish and 5 copies of Turbo Publish are
purchased, the company’s daily productivity is increasing at a
rate of 5.18 pages per day for each additional copy of Macro
purchased and by 2.09 pages per day for each additional copy 
of Turbo purchased. b. Ux(10, 5)
Uy(10, 5) ≈2.48 is the ratio of the use
fulness of one additional copy of Macro to one of Turbo. Thus,
with 10 copies of Macro and 5 copies of Turbo, the company can
expect approximately 2.48 times the productivity per additional
copy of Macro compared to Turbo.

63. a. AP(100, 0.1, 10) = 2.59; Ar(100, 0.1, 10) = 2,357.95;
At(100, 0.1, 10) = 24.72. Thus, for a $100 investment at 10%
interest, after 10 years the accumulated amount is increasing at
a rate of $2.59 per $1 of principal, at a rate of $2,357.95 per
increase of 1 in r (note that this would correspond to an increase
in the interest rate of 100%), and at a rate of $24.72 per year.
b. AP(100, 0.1, t) tells you the rate at which the accumulated

b = 1 −a, so a/(1 −a) = 1/2, giving a = 1/3 and b = 2/3.

One example is f (x, y) = −2x + 3y. Others are

75. a. b is the z-intercept of the plane. m is the slope of the
intersection of the plane with the xz-plane. n is the slope of
the intersection of the plane with the yz-plane. b. Write
z = b + rx + sy. We are told that ∂z/∂x = m, so r = m.
Similarly, s = n. Thus, z = b + mx + ny. We are also told
that the plane passes through (h, k, l). Substituting gives
l = b + mh + nk. This gives b as l −mh −nk. Substituting in
the equation for z therefore gives z = l −mh −nk + mx + ny =
l + m(x −h) + n(y −k), as required.

49. No. In order for there to be a
relative maximum at (a, b), all vertical planes through (a, b)
should yield a curve with a relative maximum at (a, b). It could
happen that a slice by another vertical plane through (a, b) (such
as x −a = y −b) does not yield a curve with a relative
maximum at (a, b). [An example is f (x, y) = x2 + y2 −√xy,
at the point (0, 0). Look at the slices through x = 0, y = 0 and 
y = x.]

. If this is 
zero, then (x + y)Cx = C, or Cx =
C
x + y = ¯C. Similarly, if 
¯Cy = 0 then Cy = ¯C. This is reasonable because if the average
cost is decreasing with increasing x, then the average cost is
greater than the marginal cost Cx. Similarly, if the average cost
is increasing with increasing x, then the average cost is less than
the marginal cost Cx. Thus, if the average cost is stationary with
increasing x, then the average cost equals the marginal cost Cx.
(The situation is similar for the case of increasing y.)
53. The equation of the tangent plane at the point (a, b) is
z = f (a, b) + fx(a, b)(x −a) + fy(a, b)(y −b). If f has a
relative extremum at (a, b), then fx(a, b) = 0 = fy(a, b).
Substituting these into the equation of the tangent plane gives
z = f (a, b), a constant. But the graph of z = constant is a plane
parallel to the xy-plane.

37. Method 1: Solve
g(x, y, z) = 0 for one of the variables and substitute in
f (x, y, z). Then ﬁnd the maximum value of the resulting
function of 2 variables. Advantage (Answers may vary): We can
use the second derivative test to check whether the resulting
critical points are maxima, minima, saddle points, or none of
these. Disadvantage (Answers may vary): We may not be able to
solve g(x, y, z) = 0 for one of the variables. Method 2: Use the
method of Lagrange Multipliers. Advantage (Answers may
vary): We do not need to solve the constraint equation for one
of the variables. Disadvantage (Answers may vary): The method
does not tell us whether the critical points obtained are maxima,
minima, saddle points, or none of these.
39. If the only
constraint is an equality constraint, and if it is impossible to

41. Answers may vary: Maximize
f (x, y) = 1 −x2 −y2 subject to x = y.
43. Yes. There may
be relative extrema at points on the boundary of the domain of
the function. The partial derivatives of the function need not be 0
at such points.
45. If the solution were located in the interior
of one of the line segments making up the boundary of the
domain of f, then the derivative of a certain function would be 0.
This function is obtained by substituting the linear equation
C(x, y) = 0 in the linear objective function. But because the
result would again be a linear function, it is either constant, or its
derivative is a nonzero constant. In either event, extrema lie on
the boundary of that line segment; that is, at one of the corners
of the domain.

f (x) = sin x; f (x) = cos x
67. Answers will vary. Examples:
f (x) = e−x; f (x) = −2e−x
69. The graph of cos x slopes
down over the interval (0, π), so that its derivative is negative
over that interval. The function −sin x, and not sin x, has this
property.
71. The derivative of sin x is cos x. When x = 0, this
is cos(0) = 1. Thus, the tangent to the graph of sin x at the point
(0, 0) has slope 1, which means it slopes upward at 45°.
