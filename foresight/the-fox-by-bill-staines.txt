The fox went out on a chilly night 
                                           D    
And prayed for the moon to give him light 
            G                    C 
He had many a mile to go that night  
     G          D                G         D          G      C 
Before he reached the town-o - Town-o, town-o  
            G                    C                   G           D                G 
He had many a mile to go that night before he reached the town-
o  
 
 
Well, he ran 'til he came to a great big bin 
                                               D     
The ducks and the geese were kept therein  
                   G                                 C 
He said, "A couple of you are gonna grease my chin 
     G       D             G         D            G    C     
Before I leave this town-o - Town-o, town-o 
                   G                                 C 
He said, "A couple of you are gonna grease my chin 
     G       D             G          
Before I leave this town-o  
 
 
Well, he grabbed the gray goose by the neck 
                         D 
Slung the duck across his back

     G                        C  
He didn't mind their quack, quack, quack  
              G      D           G       D             G     C 
All their legs danglin' down-o - Down-o, down-o 
     G                           C                   
He didn't mind their quack, quack, quack  
            G       D           G 
All their legs danglin' down-o 
 
 
Old Momma Flippy-Floppy jumped out of bed  
                                     D 
And out the window she popped her head 
                G                              C 
She cried "John, John, the gray goose is gone  
             G     D            G          D          G     C       
And the fox is in the town-o!"- Town-o, town-o 
G                              C                                G     D          G 
John, John, the gray goose is gone - and the fox is in the town-o! 
 
 
Then John he went to the top of the hill  
                            D 
Blew his horn both loud and shrill 
              G                           C           
Said the fox "I'd better flee with my kill for they'll  
G           D         G          D         G    C 
Soon be on my trail-o" - Trail-o, trail-o  
G                                 C                                   G           D 
Said the fox "I'd better flee with my kill for they'll soon be on my

trail-o

Well, he ran 'til he came to his cosy den  
                                   D 
There were little ones eight, nine, ten

Then the fox and his wife without any strife 
                                          D 
They cut up the goose with a fork and knife  
                                    C

And the little ones chewed on the bones-o. - Bones-o, Bones-o 
          G                          C                      
They never had such a supper in their life  
             G               D                 G               
And the little ones chewed on the bones-o.
