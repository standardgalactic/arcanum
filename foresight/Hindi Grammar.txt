CORRIGENDA.
(All that
can
be offered in the way of
extenuation
for this
lon^ Corrigenda
is
the fact that the author was
in England while the Grammar was passing through
the
Press in
Allahabad,
consequently
correction
of proofs
was very
limited.)

PREFACE.
Dr.
Kellogg's
" Grammar of the
Hindi
Language "
is
the standard work
on
the
subject and occupies a position
of
unquestioned
supremacy.
The
very
fulness
of the work,
however,
detracts
somewhat
from
its
value
for
a
student
commencing the study of
Hindi, and thus there is room for a
Grammar of less pretentious size and scope.
In
1896, my " Grammar of Modern Hindi " was published
by the
.te Dr. Lazarus at his "Medical Hall Press," Benares.
Another edition, revised and
slightly
enlarged, was published
at the same Press in 1908.
Finding that
the
second
edition
was nearly exhausted,
I
decided not
to
revise
and
republish
the old work but to prepare a new Grammar.
Over
20 years
of further residence and work
in India
ought,
I
felt, to enable
me
t
produce a
better
book.
Such
an
attempt
has
been
made.
A
comparison
of
the
two Grammars
will
make
ma? ifest the
fact that there are great
differences in the two
books, and
it
is hoped
that
these
changes
are for the better
in
it way of clearness and simplicity.
Apart from a few notes on
the
Braj
Bhasha, no attempt
has
been made
to treat
of
dialectical
differences, and Urdu
has not been included.
The
language
dealt
with
is
modern
Hindi in the form that many of
its best friends are endeavour-
ing to standardize
it,
a self-respecting Hindi which
is
not
for
ever
parading
its
aristocratic
ancestry
by
filling
its
pages
with Sanskrit words, nor
affecting modernity
by the cultiva-
tion of Persian vocabulary and idioms.

IV
PREFACE.
The hope
is
entertained
that
the
present volume may
more than
fill
the
place
of
the
book
which
has
done ever
20 years of service and may now be allowed to retire

THE HINDI LANOUAGE.
1.
Hindi, Urdu, Hindustani.
These three names
are
used very
loosely by many
writers
and
speakers,
and
possibly
no
definitions
are
possible which will compel general acceptance.
It
might
be
wise
to
discard
the use of the word
Hindustani as applied to literature and confine its
appli-
cation to the language so widely spoken throughout India
and
employed
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
business and
social
life.
Most of the words included in the vocabulary
of
this
lingua franca are common
to
both Hindi and
Urdu.
Hindustani
might,
with
some
measure
of
fitness,
be
used
of one
class
of
literature
affected by certain
writers who employ a vocabulary which
is
largely Urdu,
but have the works printed in the Nagari character.
Hindi
may
stand
for
those forms of
the language
which
are
the outcome
of
the
languages
which
the
early Aryan
settlers
brought with them, combined with,
and
affected
by,
the
languages
of
Madhya-desh
or
Mid-India.
It
would
seem
that
from the commingling

2
THE
HINDI

SECT.
1.
of
these
came
into
being
various
so-called
Prakrits
(and Sanskrit).
From the former of these were evolved
what Sir George Grierson
terms
the Apabranshas
(i.e.,
fallen
or corrupted
).
Prakrit
may
be
taken
to mean
" natural "
or
"
colloquial
" as contrasted with Sanskrit
which
is the polished
language
burnished
up
for
liter-
ary purposes.
The
Apabranshas
were
later
modifica-
tions of the
Prakrits, and
from
these came the
various
forms
of
Hindi
current
since, say,
about
the
twelfth
century.
Urdu may be appropriately used of the
language in
which the verbs and many other words
are common to
both Urdu
and
Hindi, but are supplemented
by a
con-
siderable vocabulary of Persian or Arabic origin.
Urdu
is generally printed in
the
Persian character, but
quite
a considerable literature has grown
up, largely
used by
the
Christian
communities,
which
is
printed
in
the
Roman character.
2.
Modern Hindi.
In the beginning of the 18th century two
pundits in
Calcutta, Lallu
Ji Lai and Sadal Misra,
instructed
and
inspired by the European head of
the
college
in
which
they were professors, initiated, or to speak more exactly,
developed,
a movement
which
is largely responsible for
the existence of modern Hindi. The endeavour was made
to draw on the
Prakrits
or Apabranshas
and,
to
some

SECT. 2.

LANGUAGE.
6
extent, on
Sanskrit,
for the vocabulary, and
to exclude,
as
far
as
practicable,
Persian
and
Arabic
words not
already naturalized.
Combined with this was the endea-
vour to
standardise certain
verbal and
other
forms in-
stead of perpetuating dialectical differences.
In recent times Hindi has suffered not a little in the
house of those of its friends who are eager to crowd their
pages with pure Sanskrit words. A few parade the range
of
their
learning by
introducing
Persian
and
Arabic
words,
thus
still
further
increasing
the
trials of
their
readers.
The
Prakrits
and
their descendants differed widely
in different parts of
India,
The aim of modern
writers,
more
or
less
consistently
carried out,
is to perfect and
make
current
a language freed from provincialisms and
suited to be a
literary
vehicle
for
the
use
of
all who
speak any of the dialects of Hindi.
The whole question of the rise of Hindi
is discussed
with
great
ability,
though
necessarily
not
very
fully,
by Sir George Grierson in his chapter on the " Languages
of India,"
in Vol.
I of " The Indian Empire"—one of the
four
volumes
written
as
introductory
to the
Imperial
Gazetteer of India.
There
is
also an
interesting
little
book on the subject in Hindi, " Hindi bhasha ki Utapatti
"
(The
Birth
of
Hindi),
by
Pundit
Mahabir
Prasad,
published at The Indian Press, Allahabad.

4
THE
HINDI
LANGUAGE.
SECT. 2.
It should
be
recognized that the Hindi represented
in this Grammar is to some extent an artificial
language
used
chiefly
in
literature.
It
is
the
language
which
writers are endeavouring to make
the common
literary
medium
for
all
the Hindi-speaking peoples.
The collo-
quials which they use in their own homes
and
in
social
intercourse may
differ widely
from this and vary much
in
different
parts
of
even
the
same
Province.
For
literary
purposes,
however,
the language
dealt with in
this Grammar
may, be
regarded
as
generally accepted
not only
in
the
United
Provinces,
but
also
in
Bihar,
Central India and Rajputana.
By some
this language has been called High Hindi,
but this term should rather be kept sacred
for
the
pro-
ductions
of those who
delight to cram their pages with
high-sounding Sanskrit words.
Up
to the
time
of
Lallu
Ji
nearly
all, and
even
since then many, works were written in verse.
In these
the language
is very different from
modern
prose.
The
Braj Bhasha, Avadhi and other dialects were used.
The
Sur
Sagar
of
Silr
Das
and the Ramayan
(Ramcharit
Manas;
of
Tulsi
Das
stand out as two great models of
this class of
literature.
During
recent
years
the endeavour has been made
to popularise poetry written
in the
standardised
modern
Hindi,
but
even to the ear of a foreigner the successes,

SECT, 2.
THE
HINDI
LANGUAGE.
5
achieved
up
to the present, appear doubtful, the
verses
lack the swing and sweetness
of
the
poetry
written
in
the dialectical forms.
However, the " Khari boli" poetry
has probably come to stay.
The
study
of
the
Hindi given in this Grammar
is
essential for every student of Hindi, as
it
is
increasingly
the
standard
language.
Every
one, however, who
is
brought
into
contact with the people, especially in rural
districts,
will
have to familiarise himself with the dialect
of the District in which his lot is cast.
3.
Tatsamas and Tadbhavas.
Words closely akin to the Sanskrit forms are called
Tatsamas cRH^
(like
that).
The
term
Tadbhavas ^"^
{produced from
that)
is
applied
to those
words which
have
been
modified from their
original forms
in
their
transition through the Prakrits and Apabranshas.
Purism
in
Hindi
is sheer folly.
Words of Persian
and Arabic origin, and words imported also from English
and
other
languages,
have made
their home in
Hindi,
and
it
is futile to try and
oust
them
from
their
place.
Pedants,
who have
struggled
to exclude all
such words
and to supply their places by
unfamiliar
Sanskrit words
or
manufactured compounds, have
done
not
a
little to
stay the progress of Hindi.
The wise writer or
speaker
is
the
man who
selects
with
discrimination his words
from
the
already
available material.
There

Indian
grammarians
are
not
unanimous
in
their
views
as
to
the
number

For
practical
purposes, the
number

be
taken
as 46,
i.e.,
1 1

35
consonants.
The 3 vowels ^ ^ ^

Iri and

krit and have
no
place in
Hindi.

Pronunciation of Vowels.
In
seeking
to
acquire
a
correct
pronunciation,
it
may be well
to
consider three points
:
1. The pronun-
ciation
must
be
learned
from
the
lips
of
an
Indian
teacher
: watching
attentively
the
speaker
as
well
as
listening
to the sounds,
is a matter of much importance
;
every endeavour
should be made to ascertain HOW the
sounds
are
made,
where
the
tongue
is
placed,
etc.
2. The pronunciation of the letters should be learned
as
the letters occur in words.
3.
It
is
still
better to group

SECT. 8.
PRONUNCIATION.
u
the words in phrases
or short
sentences, for sounds
do
not assume their
true balance and power until they take
their
place
as
parts
of
words
and
sentences.
What
foreigner would learn
the pronunciation of
" the
"'
until
he had learned
it as part of a sentence ?
The Hindi alphabet is
peculiarly
scientific, as will be
discovered
by
carefully
studying the
" classification
of
letters " chart
given
later on.
Phonetics
is no modern
discovery in
India.
It should be noted that each Hindi letter has its own
proper
sound, there is not one symbol for several differ-
ent sounds as in English, e.g., how
different
is the sound
of a in such words as lad, lace, lard, call.
While insisting on the importance of what has been
written above about learning
the sounds from the lips of
an
Indian, a few
remarks
are offered
on
some of
the
sounds
as subsidiary helps.
^ represents
a
sound
approximately
like
the
English a in
the words arise, avert or
// in
suggest.
^TT
is much like the a
in the
English
father, mart.

The vowels^ and
Sjf^ require
great attention
and
care.
It is sometimes stated
that they correspond
with
the English «and o
in such words assume and so.
This
is
misleading,
as
the sounds mentioned
in
English
are
much more
drawled
than
the
Hindi ^ and
^ft; they
commonly are
pronounced
in English with what is called
the
"
glide," a
prolongation
of
the
vowel
sound and a
gradual dying away of
it.
In Hindi, though
not
clipped,
these sounds are single and
sustained until they sudden-
ly close without any drawl.
Possibly
the
first a
in
the
phrase
" Davidic
Psalms/^ and
o
in
the
words opaque
and oration
are
about
as near as
the English language
will furnish.
Let the student ask
his
pundit
to
repeat again and
again the two phrases ^ ^ and ^ ^.
It will at once
be
evident
to
the
ear
how
very
widely
these sounds
differ, not only in the consonants
of
the
second, but in
the vowels of
both, from
the English
lay low

$
( ^ + ^ ) and ^TT
( ^rr
4- ^ )
somewhat
approximate to the ai and on in the words aisle and stout;
but
in
Hindi the amalgamation of the two
elements
of
the
diphthong seems to be more complete
than
in
the
English sounds, and the ^ and
^TT
"^etain more of their
power.
The
difference may
be
felt by listening to
an

e.g., in such words as

The long vowels

The shortening is so marked
in some instances as to lead
to
the
vowel being reckoned as
short
instead
of long,
(compare the sound with o in molest.)
9,
The Visarg can be easily disposed of.
It is infrequent
in Hindi.
It can only be described as an aspiration at the
end of a syllable.
It
is almost like an English ha reversed,
as though,"e.^., halloo, should be pronounced backwards ool-
lah. The sound must be learned from an
Indian speaker.

Anusvar and Anunasik.
Some would
contend
that both
these
are
simply
nasalizations
of different
degrees, and
that
Anusvar
is
distinct from
the
nasal
letters.
It
seems, however,
to
\the
writer
that
this
is
not
so
;
there
are
not
two
yiasalizations
and
the
five
nasal
letters
distinct from
"•oth,
bdt
one
nasalization
(the
Anunasik),
and
the

14
THE HINDI ALPHABET.
SECT.

five nasal
letters which may be represented by the Anus-
var at the option of the writer.
The
nasalization
repre-
sented by the Anunasik may vary in intensity
;
but
there
is no room between them and the nasal
letter sounds for
another nasalization.
That there are degrees of intensity
in
the
nasalization,
will
be
very evident
if attention be
given to the pronunciation of the three words, ^^.
^^1^1
and
>>| i^oil
the nasalization
increases
in
the order
in
which the words are given.
The difficulty in this matter
is increased by the fact
that much
inconsistency
exists
with
reference to
the
writing and
printing
of
Anusvar and Anunasik,
Very
frequently
the
former
(
)
is found where the sound
of the latter
(^
^
is correct.
The student may be assured
that
there
is
little
practical
difficulty
in
the
matter.
After
a
short time
it
will be found that the correct pro-
nunciation,
nasal or nasalization, will come quite
natur-
ally
and
the
reader
will
scarcely
notice
whether
the
Anusvar or Anunasik be printed.
The use
of Anusvar as the equivalent of one
of the
five nasal letters, must be treated in a separate paragraph.

Five
nasal letters may be regarded
as an
unneces-
sarily large supply
; but a little consideration will disclose
the fact that English comes
little
short of
this though
it
is more
economical
in
its
symbols
to
represent
them.
The English
" n " stands
for
:§: ^ and
wf
 
" m
"
for
"IT; the
Hindi
^If has no eqivalent in English.
It
will be noticed that
there
is a
nasal
for each
of
the five groups of gutturals, palatals,
etc.
; and the nasal
naturally assumes its proper sound when joined to any of
these
letters.
It
is on
this
ground
that
in
so many
cases the special
" n
'
is not printed, but the more simple
Anusvar used
instead.
This
becomes,
with
the
letter
following
it, a conjunct consonant, and the second letter
decides the pronunciation to be given to the Anusvar.
Some
illustrations

which
should be
carefully
practised with a
pundit.

In English, however, the

frequently
not

In
Hindi,
before

labials, there
is often
only a
nasalization, e.g.,'^X^^ a snake; ^"nTfTj ^o commit

With

the

will
be
found from the classification of letters to which group any

assumes
the nasal

No rigid
rule,
however,
can
be

:

Anusvar
is used, sometimes the Anunasik.

The Cerebral and Dental letters.
The pronunciaton
of the letters in the
"^
and
rf series
is
found
difficult
by some.
Often this only arises through insuf^cient care
in
studying
the
method
of
producing
these
sounds.
The part of the palate used by the tongue for
producing
t and
d in English
is about midway
between
the
parts
used for the
enunciation
of X
^
and H
^.
Some
teachers of Hindi write of turning the tip of
the
tongue
upwards
and
backwards
against the roof of the
mouth
to obtain right pronunciation of ^
and ^
but
it seems
to
the
writer
that
this
is
incorrect
;
the
tip
of the
tongue
is
rather
broadened
out and lumped together,
pressed
against
the
palate
rather
far
back,
and then
somewhat sharply brought away as the sound
is uttered.
It
is
worth
while
calling
the attention of the stu-
dent to the fact that all speakers do not produce
sounds
in identically the same way.
Indians
consider
our

nearer to ^and^

the

of
the ^

tongue is brought
forward
against
the
upper teeth,

even between the teeth
(some say
at the junction of the
palate with the upper teeth).
These sounds are distinctly
softer and more dental than the
t and d
in
English.

The Hindi Syllable.
It is important to understand the divisions of words
in
Hindi
which
roughly
correspond
with
our
Engish
syllables.
This matter of syllables or ^| v^ |
is
of
chief
importance in Prosody but
is well to briefly notice
it here.
The Hindi 4{\^ |
consists of a vowel
alone
or of
a
consonant, simple
or
compound,
with
its accompanying
vowel.
To make the distinction between the English and
Hindi
method as marked as possible, take
the
following
word, insiippressible.
In
English, the
division would
be
in-sup-pres-si-ble, in Hindi i-nsu-ppre-ssi-ble. Apart from
its being a closed letter, no syllable ends in
a consonant,
tJcft
one,
is
not
one
syllable,
but two '^ +^ (e-kaj
;
^^^
narrow
is not sak-rd, but
sa-ka-rd.
We
should
be tempted
to
divide ^c^dT thw^—i-kat-tM,

When
a
consonant
is
not
followed by a vowel,
it is
said to
be closed, S^

fact
is
indicated by the
sign
called f^^Q^
being written under the closed
consonant.

Use of the Initial and Medial or Final
forms of the
Vowels.
The fuller forms of the
vowels
are used
when they
I
commence
a word
or
follow
a vowel
;
when
following
a consonant,
the contracted
forms
are
used.
Thus

and in

No contracted form for ^ exists.
The

is
used in
the
same way
as
the
full
form of
the
other
vowels. ^
is understood
in
all cases where a consonant
bears no other
vowel, where
the consonant
is
not
the
first member of a conjunct consonant,
and where
it
has
not the sign of viram under
it.
In
all these cases, though
unwritten, the
jjf
is
understood
and
sounded.

Where
the fuller form
of a vowel
follows a conso-
nant,
this
fact
indicates
that
the ^
is
understood
between
the
consonant
and
the
vowel,
otherwise
the
short
form
would
be
used.
Thus ^^ = 11 + ^ + ^^
If the word were simply ^ + ^,'t would be printed T^,
In many cases, the ^ sound is very slight, but, with
care, can be distinguished
; sjH^I*
f^ieir,

sounded
exactly like ^^T,
nor ^nTrTT
'''^e ^fTT.
It
should be noted that an anusvar and the following
consonant
constitute
a
conjunct
consonant,
therefore
^
is not understood
between
them.
IJf^ = ^ + ^ +
53r,
not ^ + 5;T + ^ + ^ + ^.
Very occasionally
an

Note that the contracted form for "S

CONJUNCTS.
19.
When two
consDnants are to be
sounded
together
without the occurrence of any vowel between, they
must
be joined
together,
otherwise an
inherent ^ would
be
understood after the
first.
The
only two
exceptions
to
this are
:—
1.
When there be an
Anusvar
on the
first conso-
nant.
That and the consonant following are regarded as
a conjunct, although
the two
letters are
not
joined
to-
gether,
e.g.,
^[fT
's
^^® same as though
it were printed
^BT^fT* ^'^'j
^<^^i "O^ sanat.
But
it
should be noted
that
there is the inherent jJT between the ^ and the Anusvar.
2.
If
the Viram be found under the first consonant.
In this case, the consonant marked
with Viram and
the
following consonant become a
conjunct.
Thus
^fT|?T
would be read as though written "F^H,
(praise.)
In being joined with another
consonant, the
letter ^
entirely changes its form.
If
the
first
member
of
the
compound,
it assumes the form

X^^

is written

if the second

SANDHI.
21.
Sandhi me^ns junction, combination, and
is used
technically
to
indicate
those
changes
which
occur
in
the last letter of one word and the first of a second when
the two words are combined into one.
In Sanskrit
such
euphonic
changes
occur
not
only
in
the
formation of
compound words, but
may
more
or
less
apply
to
all
the
words
in a sentence.
Whole lines assume the form
of
one
long
compound
word,
and
apart
from
some
knowledge of the rules of Sandhi
it
is impossible to know
where one word terminates and another commences.
These Sandhi
changes
are found not only in, strictly
speaking, compound words,
btft in
cases
where
a
prefix
or suffix is added to a simple word.
Most of these changes
are
effected
in
the
Sanskrit
before the words are imported into Hindi, but this
is not
always the case.
,Tftis;be*ng so, though
it may
not
be
necessary
for
thfe
student"
of
Hindi
to enter upon the
full
consideration
of
all
the elaborate
rules
of Sandhi
found in Sanskrit grammars, yet
it
is wise
to understand
the
general
principles
and
gain some knowledge of the
fundamental rules which operate
in effecting the changes.
Apart from other considerations, it
is a distinct advantage

to
be
able
to
recognize
the
constituent elements of a
word, to know,
e.g., that Himalaya
is from f^^J, Xrost,
ice and ^TT^T,
abode.
The changes are mainly of three kinds.
1.
A
letter
may
disappear,
being
merged
into
another, e.g.,
Mf^+Jir+ll, the supreme spirit
; the inherent
^ at the end of
v^^^ has been
merged
in
the
initial
^J of ^Tr^.
2.
The two letters brought together may be combined
into another letter,
e.g.,
in
M<+( ^'H,, t^'e Supreme God
;
the
inherent ^
in
"q^j^ and the initial \ of
^"SC^
are combined into
'^,
3. One letter may be changed so as to euphonize with
the
other,
e.g.,
^J|«j|^
from
^T'TfT,
'world, and
«^7^j lord.
The ff being changed into •TjSO as to accord
with the following

A few of the principal Sandhi changes are given below.

are far too
elaborate to be included in a small Hindi Grammar.
22.
Changes of vowels.
Two similar vowels, whether
both short, both
long,
or one
short
and one long, become
the
corresponding
long vowel, e.g.,
SJf + ^jr
or
^TT + ^TT, or^ + ^fT be-
come ^n.
Similarly
with
^,
%, ^, ^,

Changes
of
Consonants.
Nothing
beyond
a
few
general
principles
can
be
given under
this
head,
as
the consonantal changes are
very numerous and complicated and belong more properly
to Sanskrit Grammar.
a.
It
is
generally
the last
letter
of the first word
that
is assimilated to the
first letter
of
the
second,
or
moderated
in
some
way, not the reverse,
e.g.,
^rfT +
^*|' s tl^^H, a good person.
b.
A
hard
consonant may be changed to
its corres-
ponding soft letter
before a soft
consonant,
e.g., "^^ -h
f^f^lf^ s f^pc(^^, world-wide conquest
; T(^ + "^Tf^
— T|»^d^l ?r,
^^^^ sj;c systems
{of philosophy).
c.
Or
it may be changed to
its corresponding nasal
before
another
nasal,
e.g.,
^ITfT^ + •TT^ = ^nT3"T^,
Lord of the world.
d.
In
numerous
cases
the
changes
are
greater
than
those
indicated
above,
a
letter
being
changed
to
one
of another
class.

more
commonly

Accent
in Hindi
is

is by no means absent.
Very

point

guilty in this matter in his Grammar written
years
ago.
As
a matter of
fact,
accent, both on words in sentences
and on
syllables
in words,
is
quite
common.
Possibly
no
rules
can
be
formulated for the latter, as we recog-
nize that in English no rule can be relied on.
In
manly,
dentistry,
pungent, the accent
is
as clearly
on
the
first
syllable as
it
is on the
second
in indent, restrict, domain.
The general
rule about the accent being on the antepen-
ultimate
in
polysyllabic words,
is by no means universal
in
its application.
Under
these
circumstances, there
is
no
reasonable
ground for complaint
if the accentuation
in
Hindi has to be learned by practice, not by rule.
Accent
of words
in
sentences.
In
Hindi,
as
in
English,
this
largely
depends
on
the
meaning
to
be
conveyed,
e.g., ^ ^^ ftv^ ^ ^TfV, T^ 5^ ^.
It belongs
to no one else, it is his, the accent naturally falls
on 3^ ^j
his.
Again,
%T^ rf^ ^-TfTT, ^o
one
hears,
the
stress
comes
on
^|d.
In
the
sentence
•T %T^ ^*T^T •T %r^ mKfi h
"^^
o«e
listens
no one
obeys
(lit. " does"), there
is practically no accent
on any
special word, but in ^ ^HHI
rft f ^ *<H^
*T^,
He hears indeed, but doesn't
do
(it),
the accent
is clearly
on
^Hrll,
hears.
The
use
of accent or stress
on words
in
sentences
varies
greatly.
Some
speakers
go evenly
on their way

3ECT. 27.
ACCENT.
41
and leave their sense to
be elucidated
by the
structure
of the sentence; others pursue the exactly opposite course
and, so to speak,
underline
and
italicize
very many
of
their words.
In some cases tone and emphasis
are very
necessary,
if the exact
meaning of the
speaker
is to be
-conveyed
to
the
hearer, e.g.,
in ^^
^^J||
He
will
do
{if), and
^^
'c|^<,JJ||
?
the meaning
depends more
on tone; but
if the
point be
as to whether
he or some-
body else will do the work,
then
stress or
accent comes
in. ^^ ^'^^TJJ may be so pronounced as to indicate very
plainl)' that
it
is
he who
will
do
it, not
another person.
In printing,
as
underlining
is
little
used,
the sentence
would probably appear
<^^' chilli .
2,S.
Accentuated syllables in words.
That accent on syllables exists widely cannot be ques-
tioned.
In %^j cf^j mine, thine, the accent is distinctly
on the first syllable;
in SITTTT. HI^^TTT* ours,
yours, as
distinctly on the second.
In ^i^TTj^i^ll, ^
'^'^'^^^ ^^ ^^^)>
He
will die, however, although these
are three-syllabled
words,
the accent
is
not on the second, but on the first
syllables.
The matter of long and short vowels evidently
does not
decide
the
matter
as
to
which syllable
is to
receive
the
accent.
In
^^ITTvTT
to
be
contained,
the
accent is on ^j

Besides the Nagari alphabet, used generally in writ-
ing and printing Hindi, modified forms are in use, e.g., the
Baniouti used by Baniyas or shop-keepers, the Mahajani,
adopted by bankers, and the Kaithi, very widely used
by
patwaris and others, especially in Bihar. The
Kaithi is a
rough script modified from the ordinary Nagari, with the
upper line omitted.
Like
handwriting
in
English some
of the letters may vary.
Note, e.g., how differently g,k,p,s,
etc., are written by different people.
For speed and ease
of
writing Kaithi has distinct
advantages.
The
writer
has used
it for many years and found
it a real saving of
labour.
It means re-writing for the Press, but a copyist
can generally be easily procured.
Several books have
been
published in Kaithi. Quite
well printed books
may be
obtained
from
Macmillan &
Co.,
Calcutta, the Kharg Bilas
Press, Patna, and other
presses.

As this
is a Hindi Grammar for English-speaking
students,
it would be
unwise to attempt to
write it from
a purely Hindi standpoint; at the same time it
is believed
that
it will prove of
considerable
assistance to
the
stu-
dent to have
his
attention
directed
to the
divisions
of
Grammar recognized by Indian Grammarians,
to
adopt,
in some measure, their order in
the presentation
of
the
various matters to be considered and to give the technical
terms which they use.
The knowledge
thus gained
will
be helpful in later reading and study.
We
are not
disposed
to
follow
their
method
too
closely,
nor adopt
all their
divisions
and sub-divisions,
which
are
sometimes
traditional,
fanciful
and
conven-
tional and of small practical
service.
Too much
atten-
tion
has been
given
by many of the
writers
of
Hindi
Grammars to Sanskrit Grammar and too little considera-
tion to the
actual
principles and rules which
prevail
in
modern Hindi.

The 3 main

ject.
For the most part, the

of Hindi
will not be
dealt with separately, but included in the various sections
as
the
subjects
arise
with
which the different rules of
Syntax are connected.
33.
The Parts of Speech
are divided into 3 classes
:
1.
^^T, which includes the Noun, Pronoun and Adjective.

the
Hindi Grammarians wisely
put
it.
Conjunction

1.
^^T, Noun.
There
is
a
growing
tendency
among
Indian
Grammarians
to
confine
the use of this
word
to mean Noun and
not to
include Pronouns and
Adjectives
under the term.
It
is not difficult to under-
stand
how
the Pronoun
should have
been
included
in
the term ^^T
'that
which
names
or
designates),
as
the Pronoun takes the place of a Noun, but
it
is
not so

There

Much
in
the way
of
detail
regarding
the forms
and uses of
the Cases,
must
be
left
for
consideration
until the following chapters,
hut,
inasmuch as the broad
principles
apply equally to Nouns.
Pronouns and Adjec-
tives,
it seems
wise
to
deal with these broad principles
at once.
37.
The Cases are indicated by the addition of
suffixes,
T^H ItK,
C'I' postpositions, Hr^^-
The
original
form
may
or may
not
undergo change
before such
addition
be
made.
This Case declension maj- not be carried
out
with complete consistency, but
is
carefully
worked
out,
and
presents
a
striking
contrast
with the elements of
declension
to
be
found
in
Pronouns
and
Nouns
in
English.
In
Nouns,
the " s"
is
all that can be brought
forward.
In
Pronouns, we
are better off, but far from
complete.
My, thy, his,
its;
our,
your,
their;
me,
us,
thee, him, them.
It
is true that in Hindi we have not
a
special
form
for
each
Case,
but
there
is
a complete
system, by the use of the fe(4{lTh.
The
form
with
vT, given under the Nominative,
is
sometimes
reckoned
a
separate
Case, and
called
the
Agentive.
There
is some justification
for such a course,
as the use of the form with % leads
to
a reconstruction
of the sentence in which
it occurs
; but,
in spite of this,
it
is
practicall}
the
subject
of
the
sentence
and
so.
in

37.
common
with
Indian
grammarians,
we
include
it with
the Nominative, regarding
it as a
special
form
of
that
Case.
38.
That
form
of
the
Accusative
which
is identical
with the simple form of the Nominative will be explained
in the chapter on the Noun.
39.
The
form
of the Dative
is identical with the form
of the Accusative with %X-
This
leads
to
some
con-
fusion at times.
In not a few instances a word which
is
regarded
by some as a second Accusative
is in reality a
Dative.
% f^Tq
(for,
for
the
sake
of)
is
used sometimes
with the Dative instead of
"^J.
40.
The
forms
for
the Instrumental and Ablative are
exactly the same and,
in instances not a
few,
to
decide
whether
the
IJ
indicates
the
Instrumental or Ablative
Case
is not easy.

of the Genitive.
The
relations covered in the use of
this Case are exceedingly
numerous.
42.
The Locative
with ^
///, and T^
upon, sweeps a
wide area.
It has reference to place,
time,
and
logical
sequence.
43.
The
Vocative
is the Case
used when
a person or
persons are directly addressed.
44.
The
following

all
the
Cases.

45.
Inflectional changes.
A
special
form
of
the
word
does
not
exist
for
each
Case.
With
some
Nouns, no change
of form
occurs
at
all
in
the
singular,
the
Case
being
indi-
cated
by
the
addition
of
the
Case-suffix or f%VTTW.
In
all Nouns, the Plural
has an
inflected
form
differing
from the Nom.
This may
be
called

or

The
same
name
is
appropriate
for the
stem
in
the
sing,
when such
a
changed stem
is
used.
The inflectional changes
are greater with
the
Pronouns than with Nouns.
46.
Case endiugs.
Some of the Case endings may he regarded as words,
such as ^j
ill
;
tf^
upon
; others partake more of
the
nature of suffixes, having no meaning by themselves.
It
might, of course, be urged that the postpositions also are
incapable of
expressing
an
idea
unless joined to
other
words
in
a
sentence.
It
will,
however,
be
felt
that
there is a distinction between
^7T,
^pfl, ^?t
^nci
TT, ^IT
?
even as in English we should
not call
"

Case endings. How written.

Should

It will
be found
that

the following rules
are accepted.
In the case
of Nouns, the
Case endings
should
be

be

with
the
Pronouns.

THE
NOUN.
59
Sounds are said to be of two kinds
:
1
.
\,c(r<<Xr+|ch,
i.e., mere
sounds
as made by animals.
2, SfTrnTT^,
i.e., composed of letters.
This definition
must
be
taken
for what
it
is worth
; words exist long
before
letters are
invented
to make a record
of them
possible.
This 2nd
class of sounds is again divided into
:
1
. "^m df^^ possessing
iiieaiiing, and 2. fi^^^r^,
xcitlwitf meaning.
Grammar,
of course, only
deals
with
this
second
class,
with
Words.
Words
are
classed
according
to
their origin or the character of their formation.
1.
«^T%. A word which
is a simple original
sound;
 
an
arbitrary
sound
possessing
a definite
meaning,
as
^•T^^"^ a man.
2- ^flT'T^l.
A word formed from combined
roots.
Here the word
is no longer an arbitrary sound,
its mean-
ing
rests
on
its
etymology,
e.g., "T^T^j
<^
worshipper,
from tj"^
relating
to
worship and ^ contracted
from
^^rff, to do.
Thus
tfN^I'cfi means, one xcho does worship.
3. qTJ|^l%.
These words
are ^JmT^ forasmuch
as
they
are derived
from roots giving meaning accord-
ing to
etymology, and
are ^|%
because the
meaning
of the
word when
it
has heen
tonned
is attached
arbi-
tranly
to some
special object,
e.g., tf^^^ a lotus, from
trgp;^
ntifd, and ^^ born of.
The meaning
is plain from
the etymology
; but to attach the word
to the
lotus must

60
THH NOUN.
SECT.

be
regarded
as arbitrary, as
there
are other mud-born
things besides the lotus.

There
are various other divisions of Nouns adopted
by some
Indian grammarians such
as
those
indicating

Collective Nouns, ^^T, an association or assembly.
There are many N'erbal Nouns in Hindi,
e.g., the In-
finitive is a Noun in very frequent use, ^pJ^Tf]",
to
do,
the
doini^.
This
is
called
in
Hindi
the TiRTT^T^
''SfWT
Another group bears the name
of
S^rfrri. These include
such words
as ^^tT^T^T,
^ doer.
The
Infinitive
is fully capable of inriection as regards
Case, Gender and Number.
50.
There are
four matters
calling
for
special atten-
tion
in connection with Nouns.
These will now be dealt
with:
1. Gender.
2. Number.
3.
Cases.
4. Compound
Nouns.
GENDER.
51.
The Gender of Nouns is,
in Hindi, a matter of great
importance and of about equal difficulty.
Its importance
rests on the fact that the gender of the Nominative often
affects the form of the Verb
; also the gender of the Noun
affects
the
form
of
the
Adjective
or
Participle.
The
difficulty arises from this
that, as there
is no neuter gen-
der in Hindi, every noun
is either masculine or feminine,
though so many must
obviously
be
quite devoid
of any
sex
distinction.
The
termination of the Noun may
at
times
afl^ord some help, but no reliable rule can be formu-
lated on that basis.
For instance, from the fact that
l^fj

62
THE NOUN.
SECT.
51.
and ^ are the characteristic
terminations,
respectively,
of
masc. and
fern.
Adjectives and Participles, and
also
of many
parts of the Verb, one might naturally be led
to
conclude
that Nouns ending
in
3IT|"
and
'^
would
like-
wise
be
masc. and
fern.
Such a conclusion
would
be
very misleading
; probably something like
75 per cent, of
Nouns ending in ^f are
not masc.
but fern., and
a
very
large number of Nouns ending
in ^ are masc.
52.
After stating that
living creatures
of the male sex
are masc. and of the female fem.,
the only general
prin-
ciple or tendency
that
can
be
laid down
is
this,
that
larger things
are
commonly
masc. and
smaller
things
and abstract nouns fem., but this
is only a broad principle,
not a rule.
Indian writers often set forward this
statement
as
a
help
to
the student,—Nouns
ivhich
require
the uiasc.
form of
the Adjective
are masc, those ivhich
require
the
fem. form are fem.
This statement
is obviously correct,
but, we are
at first
inclined
to
conclude,
as
obviously
futile,
as
it
begs
the
whole
question.
The
statement,
however,
is quite serviceable
for
the Indian
student and
yields a suggestion
for the
foreign
student of consider-
able value.
The Indian student will try words by his ear.
.He will say "^TCT^,"^
large island ,"%:T'err 2:1^,"
and will
decide
that
the former
is right, the second im-

SfcCT.
52.
GENDER.
6iJ
possible, in the
same way that we repeat a sentence and
by the ear conclude what
is correct
and what incorrect.
The
suggestion
that
is
forthcoming
is this
:
Let
the
foreign student, instead
of attempting to commit to
me-
mory the genders of long lists of words, learn to associate
with each Noun an Adjective, or to connect
it with other
words in a phrase, in which the form of the Verb or some
other word
will settle the gender
of the
Noun.
In this
way, he will not only be fixing the gender of the Noun
in
his memory but, at
the
same time,
enlarging
his
voca-
bulary, e,o.. >a"^^ ^^, Uood fntif

Some general
rules about

may prove
of
some service, but the
student must remember that
they
are only general,
MASCULINE.

So

This
remarU
applies
to
many other Nouns as well as those ending
in ^.
a.
Many
Nouns
in which ^
is added as a suffix
to
a Noun
signifying
some
quality,
and
thus
means
the
possessor of that quality,
c.i^.,
TI"J"tfx
a sinner.
^PTSTT
-^ counsellor.
JT^TT
one who loves.
^JT^TT^TT
-^ transgressor.
^^i

^|<^
|
a learned man.
^T^Tl an avaricious man.
One exception may be noticed. ^J^TTT
's
dejection,
3i^|tl,
'^ dejected
man.
This
is similar to the
Urdu
in
which
it
is the quality which ends,
in
'^
•
the
possessor
of the quality has not the "%
at the end. Thus
:—
'TTT^T
^*r!r^?
poverty
; Tf^^,
a poor man.
^rrf^T^rt 'S^r'^^
> helplessness
; >J{Im1^, a helpless one.
Such Urdu words ending in ^ are fern.,
and
retain
their Urdu gender when used
in Hindi.
b.
A Class of Nouns used of members of
castes or
trades.
It
should be
borne
in mind that membership
of a

SECT. 54.
MASCULINE.
6S
caste
does
not
necessarily
involve
that
the
member
should follow the occupation of the caste. Mr. Glover
is
not
in
all cases a maker or seller of gloves.
To a
large
extent,
however,
the
members
of
the caste do
follow
the occupation, and identification
with the
caste
cannot
be evaded.

that

Again,
the word '^TrTT,
^pi^'it, though
still generally masc.,
is
used as fern, by some writers.
This, likewise, is probab-
ly
due to the influence ot Urdu, the word "

There are two
Numbers
in
Hindi,
Singular
anJ
Plural.
A Dual Number
exists
in Sanskrit
but has
not
been brought into Hindi.
Only the Nominative Case will be
referred to
in this
section
; the forms of Oblique Cases
vvill be dealt with in
the section on the Cases.
The majority of
masculine Nouns
do not possess
a
different
form for the Nominative
Plural
; consequently,
it
is only by
the
forms
of
other
words
in
the same
sentence,
or
by
the context,
that
it can
be
decided

whether
a
Noun
be
sin^.
or
plural.
In
not
a
few
instances
it
is
the context
alone
that
can
make
the
matter
clear.
In
the
sentence, ^T^T '^^^
r",
it
is
impossible to tell whether the translation should be " the
king has come'
of " the kings Jiave conic."
The
verb
is
in the plural, but
this would be quite appropriate
if only
one king were referred
to, the plural verb being honorific.
83.
The Four Declensions
of Nouns.
In dealing with Number
and
Cases
of
Nouns, we
may place
the Nouns in
4 classes
:
I.
Some mascs. ending in
"^J.
II.
All
other
mascs.
Some ending
in
"^"J must
be included
in this
class, those
ending
in any
other
vowel, and those ending
in a consonant.
III.
Fems. endmg
in
^^
"^^ 3,
"3\.
IV.
Fems.
ending in any
other
letter.
84<.
For
deciding whether
a masc.
Noun
ending
in
I^TT, should
be included in the
1st or 2nd class, the rule
has been given that Tadbhavas in
^fj" belong to Class
I,
Tatsamas to Class
II.
It
is
evident, however,
that such
a rule
is worthless to any but an advanced scholar.
The
best course
to
take
is to try and fix the mascs. ending in
jjn*
that
belong
to
II
(and
they
are
quite
limited
in
number),
the rest may then
be
regarded
as
belonging
to Class
I.

THE NOMINATIVE.
95.
There
are
two
forms
of
the
.Nominative
Case.
The second
with %
is often called the .-Xi^entive
Case
:
but for all practical
purposes
it
is a second
Nominative.
It
is
not,
like the
second
form for the
Accusative,
an
alternative
form which may
be used
or
not
at the
dis-
cretion of the
speaker or writer
;
with
certain Tenses of
certain Verbs
it
innsf
be
used.
With
all
the
Tenses
formed from the Perfect Participle
of Transitive Verbs,
its use
is compulsory.
Further
particulars
concerning
this very important matter will be found in its appropriate
place in the chapter on the Verb.
By some
writers
on
Grammar
this form
is
regarded as a Case quite distinct
from the Mom.,
its \'erb being used with an impersonal or
passive
force.
Thus ^^^TT ^ <|^|

The Nominative Case

little
ex-
planation concerning
its use
is necessary, as, apart from
the Nom.
with

its use
is exceedingly simple.

THE ACCUSATIVE CASE.
97.
The Accusative Case may take the form of the Nom.^
or the form to which ^^ is attached.
To form a rule, or
ruJes, by which
it can be
decided
which form should be
used in each individual instance
is impossible.
No
rule
exists on
the subject, and not in
all cases can
it be said
that
the
matter
is regulated
by
idiomatic
usage,
for
sentences
could
be,
given
which
in
other
respects
thoroughly correspond, yet 5Rt
is used
in one,
but
not
in the other.
It
is,
in not a few sentences,
a matter of
taste, one writer affecting a larger and another a smaller
use of this or that form.
Having made such a statement,
it must be carefully
guarded
and
restricted in its application.
It should be
fully recognized that in many cases
idiom
does
decide
that not only
is one form distinctly better than the other,
but that one
is right, the other practically impossible.
There
are
certain
broad
principles
which may be
helpful.
li
1,1

SECT,
97,
THE NOMINATIVE CASE.
97
a. With Pronouns, the form with ^R^
is very general-
ly used,
?f^ ^^%T ^^^5
^
saiv him,
is right
; 5^^ ^T^^
it would be difficult to find
in, perhaps, any
writer.
b. The form with ^^
is very widely used with proper
names. TTT^tT ^ ^td
\ *^ , Call Ram Datta.
c. The form
without ^n"
'^
found
more
often
with
lifeless
things and with animals than with
persons,
e.g.,
TT^T *T
"^T.
|r%,
^^''^
^"^S worshipped his feet.
5flp%
^ft^
"^<«1|M
^,
^ had driven on
the
horses.
On
the
other hand,
we
find ^:^ ^, i!|^Hl ^,
"^TS ^.
d. Where a Dative is used in the same sentence, and
no other
equivalent
takes
the
place
of
cl^
with the
Dative, the Accusative
is
generally used
in
the
Nom.
form, thus avoiding the occurrence of two ^ft s
in
the
same sentence.
e. Where the connection between
the
verb
and
the
Noun
is
very
close,
the g^
is often
omitted,
^^f^ %
I ^^ ^n^
W«fT,
'^he woman heard

Many
words joined
closely
up
with ITTTtTT have the Accus.,
without
the ^^ ^"^
^^^
Noun
indicating
the
person
struck,
with
the ^.
This
is
probably
a
Dative,
though
many
prefer
to
call
it
a
second
Accusative.

THE NOUN,

<rllH ^TTT,
^^^^
horse kicked the
boy.
According
to
Hindi,
it
is
the
" kick
"
that the
horse
strikes, not the "
boy."
The boy is the
recipient
of the kick and, therefore,
in
the
Dative.
Compare the
EngHsh
phrases, "He
struck
a bargain with the man"
and
" He struck the boy a blow.''
/. While the omission of ^7t
'""^y suggest
closeness
of connection between the
Verb and Noun,
the
use
of
Gpt has a tendency
to indicate stress and emphasis.
98.
Double Accusatives.
Double Accusatives do occur;
but in many sentences which might
be brought forward
as
illustrations,
careful
consideration will
possibly lead
to the conclusion that one of
the
so-called
Accusatives
is more strictly speaking a Dative.
Take the
following
as
illustrations
of
the
genuine
Double Accusative
:
<|'^ | ^
^nft^q"! ^
^"T^

bears the
^f^.
In
the
two
sentences
printed above,
it
is Ayodhya and
Kiitiib-iid-din which are the principal Accusatives
; "his
capital
" and
" his chief man "
are, in a sense, predicat-
ed of these.

SECT.

THK NOMINATIVE CASE.
9&
In
sentences
like the
following, the word
with
3^^
is
more
strictly
a
Dative than
a
second Accusative
:
^IT
^TH^RT
'^T%«TT
^K, Having
had
his
sons
and daughters
clothed
with
the
very
choicest
clothes
and
jewels.

on
was
the
clothes and jewels— on
to his children.

the f^^ shews
that ^^g^" ^
is a
true Dative. ^^ ^nW^ H^T^ %T %^rTT ^^SH,

invitation
to
84 kings.
" To the kings
"
is
clearly Dative. So, again, in ^^T^H^ '^^^ *Tfft%
^Rt ^nrn",
He entrusted the kingdom to his nephew.
It
is similar with the two Nouns after such words as
fe^T^, ft^TTT, ^rf^^TT,
etc.
What
is caused to
be eaten, or drunk, or explained,
is
the
food,
the
drink,
the
matter,
these
are the Accusatives, the people who
do the eating and drinking and have the matter
explain-
ed to them are
the
recipients,
they
are
in
the
Dative
Case.
99.
Where there are two Accusatives, one complement-
ing the other, the Case sign, the ^ntj
'^ used only
after
the second; the first is generally written in the Nom. form.

Accusative of place
The
Accusative
is
often
used
of the place to which
motion
is
directed
or
the
place
which
is
reached.

101.
Accusative of time.
The Accusative
is
similarly

reference

There
is
one
use
of
the
Infinitive
with

Another
form for the Dative of Pronouns exists,
but
the consideration of that will come
in
the
chapter

Pronouns.
The Dative has various uses, but they may probably
be fairly comprised under three headings.

104.
The Dative
of
Possession
or Acquisition.
This covers not merely material possessions, but also
mental and
moral qualities and
responsibilities.
Many
of these uses are met in
English by
the word " has "
or
had.'
We can say that a man has a cat,
or
a
cold
or
a conscience, a garden or a bad temper, a great Joy, a
sense of responsibility , a
suspicion.

THE INSTRUMENTAL CASE.
106.
The particle ^ is used with both the Instrument-
al and Ablative cases.
It is probably this
fact
and
the
difficulty of deciding in many instances under which case
a word should be classified that has led to the two
cases
being
united
under
the
name
" Ablative "
by
some
There
appears,
however,
no
sufficient justification for
adopting this course.
Undoubtedly,
it
is
not easy to de-
cide in all instances under what case a certain word with
^ should be placed, but
it
is perfectly clear that the two
cases
are
not
identical.
There
are
many
instances
where a word
is Instrumental (

it could not

GENITIVE
CASE.
109
The uses of
this and the Instrumental Case are very
numerous and various.
The foregoing*
illustrations
will
indicate the general lines of those uses.
THE GENITIVE CASE.
108.
There are three forms for this case,
viz., ^TT,^!,
qR.
The form assumed
depends
on
the
word
which
follows, not on that which precedes.
In
^fx
^ftj
^T.,
The
xc()iiiaii\s
house
(lit., of
the woman,
the
house),
the
form of the Gen. affix depends on
the gender of house
;
the matter
is not affected by the gender of
the possessor
of the house.
^n*
is
used when the following Noun
is Masculine,
Sing., and Nominative.
^n
is used when the following
Noun
is
Feminine,
Sing, or PI. of any Case.
"Sfi
is used when the following Noun
is
Alas.
PI.
of
any Case, and also when a Sing. Masc. Noun
in an Oblique Case follows.
Thus
: —
^^ra

The
r^r\<:{ \rr\j or
(^H <4 |<f(t
^^eing in
the Genitive
Case, the^T^TT
's changed to the construct, stem before
adding the Case sign.
In the case of ^T^H-
there
is no
change of stem, as in fems. the stem
is the same through-
out in all the Cases in
the sing.
The
form
of the Case
sign
3KX,
^fn", %,
is
regulated
b}-
the
Gender
and
Number of the following word.
Perhaps the clearest was- to regard
the
matter is to
treat the first related word with
its affix as an Adjective,
and
such
it
is
in some
respects.
As we say,
^TT^fT
^fy^gl

The
^H", ^iT, %
depend on the sex and
number of the horses, not
in any
way
on
that
of the
possessors.
109.
An
exception
to
the
rule
about
changing
the
^H"
to % before a Noun (or Infinitive used
as a Noun)
should here be noted.
It
not
infrequently
happens
that
the

remains unchanged, where a change to the construct, form

Alternative of Genitive or Accusative.

Genitive may take the place of an Accusative.

from
the
same page

"^n^TT
c(T, He ordered the chamberlain to bring the bird.
?t, As

In
the
first
sentence,
we
might
have %T instead of %, and
in
the
second. TCTjT^^ ^
ifHJ^
would be quite
idiomatic.
There are instances
where the meaning might be dubious, e g., 3^^ ^^TPT
% ^Fm ^TTT,

be
translated,
" What
i.-<
the
good
of
railing him?"
or,
-What
is the
good of
his
calling'r
i.e.,
calling someone
else.
If the
former be
the
meaning
intended and
this
be
not
perfectly clear
from
the
context,
the
Accusative
construction should
be adopted.
One or two additional illustrations are
given
:

the

125.
Where
the
question
of
a.iireement
of the Case
ending with two or more words
is involved, the
general
rule,
perhaps,
is
for
it
to
agree
in
gender

the

it may be in the plural and masc, so
as

all the words involved.

THE VOCATIVE CASE.
133.
^ or
some other
Interjection may
be
used
to
indicate the N'ocative Case, but this is not essential
: very
frequently the Vocative
is used without any Interjection.
When the
Noun belongs
to Class
I,
the ^J may be
changed to ^ for the Vocative, but this
is frequently not
done.
In the other three Classes of Nouns,
no
oblique
form exists
in the singular.
Thus
in
a
great
majority
of instances,
in the singular, the Locative
is the same as
the Nominative.
In the plural, however, the Vocative form
is
in com-
mon
use.
The form
is the same as the oblique stem for
the other Cases,
with
the
exception
that
the
anusvar
is dropped. Thus we have ^^^RT, Oh. boys.

COMPOUND NOUNS, ^m^
13 4.
The
first
point
to
consider
is,—What
Nouns
should
be
included
under
this heading
?
Some would

126
THE
NOUN.
[sect.
134.
include
all
Nouns
which
are in any way compounded,
that is to say, which
are made
up
of
any
addition
or
additions
to
the
basis
modifying
in any
degree
the
meaning of the original word.
According
to
this,
such
a word
as
*Jf"S! I"»T^
would be considered a Compound
Noun, forasmuch as the privitive ^ changes
the
mean-
ing
of
"5j|5T<H'|.
Similarly, -ejMrll
itself might
be
re-
garded as a Compound, because the suffix
cTT has
given
an abstract meaning to the original.
Undoubtedly all such
words are Compounds but,
on
the whole,
it seems better
to
leave
words compounded
in such a way for consideration
in the
chapter
on
Pre-
fixes
and
Suffixes
and
to confine our attention here to
those Compounds which are made up of two or more
or
less complete words,
as,
e.g.,
T1^H4^,
kings house,
palace.
'Wfi^''^^''^^-'^^Ti
The worship of
the
feet
of the mother-in-law and
ftither-in-law.
There
still remains the difficulty of deciding whether
words
placed
in
juxtaposition,
but not
modified in any
way as regards form and
meaning,
should
find
a
place
under
the heading
of Compound
Nouns
;
such pairs of
words, for instance,
as TTfT
f^T,
night,
day. ^M
J^T^rnC,
thought, consideration.
The fact that the
Con-
junction has been dropped between such
pairs
of words,
does
constitute
some
small ground
of justification
for
their
inclusion, and
we
therefore
give them
a
place.

SECT.

COMPOUND NOUNS.
127
Mention
may
be made
also of some other words which
have a feebler claim to be called Compound
Nouns,
but
for the consideration of
which
no
more
suitable
place
may be found.
The Compounds
which
are
to
be
considered may
consist of two, or more, Nouns, or of a Noun, compound-
ed with an Adjective, an Adverb, a Verbal Noun, or some
other Part of Speech.
Some
of
the
words
so
compoimded,
are
strictly
speaking Adjectives, but are also used as Nouns.

TflSJ I^T,

The words which make up these Compounds may
be
variously related.

nature
of

the

word,

that

Relative and correlative.
In English, the corre-
lative
often comes
before
the
relative
;
in
Hindi
it
is
exactly the reverse.

This matter cannot be
enlarged on here, but
it
is one
that should have
the very careful
attention of
the student.
It
is one of
those matters where
it
is very
easy for a learner to get into the way of writing English-
Hindi
and
not
realising
that
it
is so.
Unfortunately,
many
a teacher
would not
point out
a
matter of
this
kind, for
there
is
no
absolute
rule on
the subject.
In
thoroughly
good
Hindi,
the correlative
does
sometimes
come before the relative.
Let
us
take one
more sentence.
" The man whose
house
is near
mine

present in the way of
rules about the order of words

It must
be clearly understood that the order indicated
is only a
"
general instruction,"
There is no absolutely fixed order.
12.
In some interrogatory sentences and under cir-
cumstances
in which special
stress
is to be laid upon
a
word, the order of words in a sentence may be complete-

changed,

A
matter
of no

importance
in
the
con-

ta.

is
far more used
in
Hindi
than
in
English.

it,

ed commas, the English quotation marks.

sentences

it

necessary to exercise considerable care if misunderstand-
ing
is
to
be
avoided.
In
reporting

THE
REPETITION OF WORDS.
147
The repetition of a word— Noun, Adjective, Pronoun,
Adverb,
Participle
or Verb—plays
quite, an
important
part
in
Hindi composition.
The repetition of
the
Verb
may
be
left
for the present and reference only made
in
this section to other Parts of Speech.
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
matter
now
treated
of
is
quite
distinct from the doubling of words
referred
to
in
the section on Compound Nouns.
Here
we are speaking
of
the
repetition
of exactly
the same
word. This repetition has a force
of considerable power.
The force
differs with
different words, and
in
different
sentences.
The following rough
classification and
illus-
trations
will
perhaps sufficiently indicate the main prin-
ciples of this idiomatic repetition of words.

Such

are
affected by some
writers,
but
more
generally
the
masc.

is
used
as a common
gender and made to
do service for
both
genders.
Not
infrequently, the
form
in the fem. ending in ^

used
as a fem. Noun.

Compapison of Adjectives.
No system of
the Comparison of Adjectives exists in
Hindi
corresponding
with that
in use
in English,
but
there
are idioms
by
which the
results of
a comparison
can be readily expressed.
A
few Sanskrit
Comparatives and
Superlatives
are
imported ready-made into
Hindi,
e.g.,
ch|cS5THi,'* 'more
difficult
: ^TT^"^, most wealthy
; fjT^'^IT, most
beloved
;
but these are
stray words, and do not indicate any such
system
in Hindi.
The
most
general
way
of
expressing
the
Com-
parative
is
by throwing the
person or
thing with which
the comparison
is made into the Ablative Case, with ^
and using the
simple
Adjective.
Thus "'T^'^
^^TT W
^VI A I H S, A man is stronger than a ivoman.
^JH^
^HC
3W ^
vi\Tj
{ «
This house is higher than that.

158
THE
ADJECTIVE.
[SECT.
162
Other
idioms also
are
current,
e.g„ by the
use
of
^^^^
the
Conjunctive
Participle
of
'6|<^viL
to go
heyond. ^ ^{T^
If ^3^ % ^f^vC %r|
WT^ft
r|ri|
R, There is no more
learned man

he.
By the use of
>i{l)\^|, ^^^ ^JP^"^ ^ ^^T
W
This is greater than that, or,
lit.,
/n com-parison with
that
this
is great.
Perhaps
the
most
common
way
of expressing the
Superlative is by adding ^[^
to
the
Noun with
which
the
comparison
is
made
and
converting
it
into
the
plural form, retaining the
Ablative %j
as
with the Com-
parative.
Thus Comparative.
T(^ TTWT 3^ TT^T "F
'q|>^
1 «, This king is greater than that.
Superlative
: TfW
TT^
'^r^ TT^TRff % ^^T
t,
'^^^^'^ ^^^^ ^^ greater
than all kings.
This
is not peculiarly satisfactory, as
it
is inexact
;
for
it involves
logically that he
is no
longer
a king or that he
is greater than
himself.
A
more
cor-
rect idiom is also employed: ^ is used instead of %j
thus,
^5r^ iMI^Tf ^ Tf TrSTT ^r^ %
'^^«^'' ^^^9
*'« among
all kings the great one,
i.e.,
the greatest.
For fulness and
exactness, the followmg is perhaps the best idiom of all
:
^5r^ xtm-mi ^, 3^ ttstt % %t^ ^t ^ t,
Among all kings there is none greater
than
he

or 5^f^
Amo7ig alt kings there is none his equal.

COMPARISON.
159
There
are
other ways of expressing something equi-
valent

use
of
such
words

>|{^^ ^ *H^<^|, Good than the good, i.e., best

^tT^ % ^tHT,
do
do.
grf^^ % *fi' ^Ff^^, Hardest of all.
^rRl^Tf^^,
^ost exceedingly.
W^ % W^,
Very great (pi.)
%T% % %T%,
Very small
(pi.)
Or, by the addition of
an
adverb
before
the,
adjec-
tive,
e.g.,
^irfn,
^Tr^r^rf,
^^^r^ e.g., ^Tm
^'ii

by
that of the

also

so
far
as
it

to do

dency,
however, among the more
cultured
and educat-
ed classes, to use
the singular
form in
speaking
about
oneself, and
it may be taken
as an utterly
safe
rule
to
always
use
the
singular
in referring to oneself.
Let
it
be recognized,
at
the same
time, that the
use
of
the
forms ^^ and SIHTT
is not atall equivalent to the "we'*
in English used as the "plural of majesty," or the "editorial
we."
In past days, the[plural forms were far more used for
the singular than they are at present; and this accounts for
the fact that
in
many places tfU^I
is added
to '^^,
to
indicate the
plural, where the context
might not
clearly
shew
whether
the singular
"

it be

Hindi
is only discussed here.
cT
in
Urdu
is
perfectly correct and needs no discussion.
In
this
paragraph,
the
writer
uses
"
I,"
as he is
fully aware that, on this important
question, a consider-
able majority of missionaries
differ
from
him.
As
re-
gards the translation of the Bible,
I regard it as perfectly
sound to
retain the
singular.
The
attempt
to
discri-
minate
between the adoption
of
r{ and H^ and >||m
would
continually
be
involving
the
translator
in
the
responsibilities
which
belong
to the
commentator.
A
simple translation of
the Pronouns for God and
for
all
persons
is
the
easy
and safe
course.
When, however,
the
question arises
of how
to
address
God
in
prayer
• and
worship,
and
how
to
write
or
speak
concerning

168

God,
it seems as appropriate to use
4||l|
in direct ad-
dress and % in writing or speaking, in
Hindi, as
it does
to'spell
" Him "
with a
capital
" H "
in
English.
In
my reading
for
many years,
I
have
given
particular
attention
to the
matter
; and
the
conclusion
which
I
reached
a long
time
since
has
been
fully
confirmed.
The matter stands thus.
Most missionaries, and, follow-
ing them,
the
majority
of
Indian
Christians,
use H,
Some, however,
of the
well-read
Indian
Christians do
not approve of this, and
a few missionaries do not.
By
some
Hindus,
probably
through
education in
Mission
Schools, H has been adopted,
but speaking generally of
Hindus, the view
is clearly that H
is very
inappropriate,
H^
is
slipshod and lacking
in
reverence,
»|| |Cf and q
are the
correct Pronouns to use.
I have accepted
and
adopted
this
for many years,
and
to me ^ and ^^
sound
as
grating
as does
" you
"
when used
to
God
in prayer in English.
I could easily produce very many quotations to back
up the statement made.
I will satisfy myself with giving
just some few.

Omission of Pronoun.
The Pronoun

DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS AND 3RD
PERSONAL PRONOUN.
173.
In
Hindi,
there
is no
Personal
Pronoun
for the
3rd person, but the two
Demonstrative
Pronouns,
near
and
remote,
quite
efficiently
supply
the
place.
That
these
Demonstrative
Pronouns
(
IfS"
and ^^
,
this,
that) do not indicate the gender,
is a
defect which
they
share
in common
with
the
real Personal Pronouns for
the
1st and 2nd persons.
In English
also, the
1st
and
2nd
persons
(/ and you) do not indicate gender, but the
3rd does, he, she,
it.
These two Demonstrative Pronouns not only render
service as Personal Pronouns, but also as Correlatives.

174.
Use of Singular and Plural. When used as Per-
sonal
Pronouns, ^and % may be substituted for q^ and
^ as honorific, and the Verb will then be in the Plural,
e.g.,
of
a
king, ^ ^T^ >^J^ ^^ He has now come
; of
a
rishi,
g* c|^^ WT^'T, He will go to-morrow.
On
the
other hand,
in the Nominative, the singular
forms 7(^ and ^^ are sometimes
found
with
a plural
meaning,
this being
indicated by the plural form of the
Verb being used.
This
is due to the influence
of
Urdu,
in
which
this
idiomatic
(and
sometimes catchy) use of
'^^ and c^ greatly prevails.
In Hindi, this idiom is of
quite recent times, and is by no means generally

They may

The
Pronominal
Adjectives
are, as
the
name
sig-
nifies, Adjectives formed
from the
Pronouns.
In many
instances, they are used alone, with a Noun understood
;
in such cases, they are
declined as
Nouns, otherwise as
Adjectives of two terminations.
In not a few instances
these words are distinctly Adverbial
in their use.
The
first
series
of
these
Pronominal
Adjectives
indicate Quantity or Number, the second Quality.
Their
initial letters are

their meaning, in the
same way as those of Pronouns, referred to in section 182,

In reference
to
these Paradigms, a few explana-
tory notes are furnished.
^-
^T*TTj
'" the
sense of
" to become,'''
is complete
in
all
its parts.
This Verb serves, generally,
also as the
Substantive
Verb
"
to
be,"
" to
exist
;
"
but
for
this
latter, two
special
additional Tenses
exist which do not
appertain to ST«TT
''"' the sense of
" to become.'"
These
two Tenses
are a Present ^
he
is
: ^^,
Jie icas.
These
are
not
interchangeable
with
the
two
corresponding
Tenses of
^T*TT,
f'>
become,
which
are ^THT ^
'
^^^
becomes
; sXfTT ^^J,
^^^ '^'^^ becoming.
^ and ^IT and certain
parts of
the
verb ^*TT
3**^
used as Auxiliaries in the conjugation of other Verbs.
2.
It
is
worthy of
notice that throughout
the
Tenses
the 2nd and 3rd
person
singular
are
exactly
the same
in form, also the 1st and 3rd plural.
3.
In
some Grammars,
1st and
3rd persons are given
under
the
Imperative.
This
appears to
be
incorrect.
The
Imperative
can
be
used only
in
the
2nd
person.
The nearest approach
to an
imperative
for
the
1st
or
3rd
person
is
" let me
do
so and
so,''
" let him do so
and so."
This
is not Imperative but
Optative, and
the

SECT.
198
PARADIGMS.
203
forms
of
the
Contingent
Future
meet
the
need.
To
print
these
forms
a second
time, under the Imperative,
is misleading.
The
only
approach
to
a
3rd
person
under
the
Imperative are the special
"
respective
" forms
provided
to
use
with
the
honorific
>1{|1^
.
This
has
the
3rd
person in
construction, but with the meaning of the 2nd
person.
4.
In
the Paradigms,
the
English
translation
is
only
given
for one person, and that the 3rd person, this often
being
more
simple
and
more
commonly
in
use
than
the
1st
person.
The student will know
that
if
the
3rd
person be "he will go," the
1st and 2nd
sing,
and
pi.
will be " / will go,'' etc., etc.
5.
Full
Paradigms
are

In
the
case
of
other
Verbs,
only
the
differ-
ences

the
normal

are
referred

As
a
matter
of
fact,
the
conjugation
of
the Hindi
Verb
is
exceedingly
simple,
offering
comparatively
few
excep-
tions to the general norm.
6.
The
so-called
Adverbial
Participle
( ^p^f^ CT
upon
(his)
going,
or some
similar
meaning)
is
not in-
cluded
in
the
Paradigms.
This
is
merely
one
use of
the Imperfect Participle, and has no claim for demanding
separate mention in the Paradigm of the Verb.

Apart from something
to break,
to tear,
or to

can be
little meaning
of sucli words
in a sentence.
(2).
Intransitive (:JT^1T^)-
This name gives one parti-
cular phase of the classification,
viz-
, that
it has no object
or
Accusative,
It
may,
however,
be
that
the
Verb
indicates
activity
on
the
part of
the Subject,
e.g., c^
33T S
^'^ ^^8 risen
; or, there may be
involved a mere-
ly
passive
state,
as ^^
^ftfTT

T%T T^^THT

(3).
Neuter.
A Neuter Verb
is
not only
intransitive,
but,
strictly
speaking,
implies
a
state
for
which
the
1
subject
is not
responsible
on account of any activity of
his,
e.g., ^ ^TrTT f ,
^'^
i^ sleeping
: ^^ ^^
T\^\
^
It
is lying there.
(4).
Passive-Neuter.
The Verbs belonging to this class
must be
dealt
with
in a
separate section, as they play a
very important
part in
Hindi.
They
are
Neuter,
they
are also truly
Passive,
but in
structure
and
force
dis-
tinctly differ from the ordinary Passive Verbs.
(5).
Impersonal

class,
it

real
importance.

Passive
Verbs.
These
are much
used
in
Hindi.
They
correspond
very
much
with
Passive
Verbs
in
English, and require
little
notice.
What

Object, with an

(7).
Causal
Verbs,
These
V^erbs
constitute
a
very
large class, and will need careful and full treatment later.
These Causal Verbs convey the idea of
causing
that
to
be
done
which
is expressed
by the
simple Verbs from
which they are formed.
In
English, we say,
The
child
eats,
The
mother
feeds
the
child;
or.
The
child fell,
A man threic the child doicn
; or, A man caused the child
to
fall.
In Hindi, the Causal Verbs meet all such cases
in
a very
neat
and
effective
way,
e.g., ^<^^J "U(CT
^mj I,
The
child
eats bread. ^J ^:g% %T hz^
\l^t*[ IHT
^,
^^'^
mother feeds

2.
Classification
according-
to
form.
The con-
jugation
of the
Hindi
Verb
is
remarkably
simple
and
regular.
Apart from the changes effected
in the
struc-
ture
of those
six Tenses
which
are
from
the
Perfect
Participle,
the
irregularities
are
very
few.
Even
in
the case
of
the Passive
Voice,
the
endings
of
all
the
parts are quite regular, conforming closely to the
Active
Verb.
As,
however,
some
modifications
do
occur
in the
conjugation of certain Verbs, owing
very
largely
to
the
final
letter
of the
stem,
some classification seems to be
called
for.
The
following

appears
to
fairly
cover the ground

Spread out in this way, the
list may appear somewhat
formidable
; but
any such
impression will
be
dissipated
on an
examination of the
very slight
differences in
the
structure of the various classes given.
The only difference between
1 and 2
is
that effected
in the six
Tenses
formed
from
the Perfect
Participle.
Nos. 3 and 4 only
differ
from Nos.
1 and
2 in the
for-
mation of the Perfect Participle,
T[X
being added to
the
stem, instead ofjJTT
alone.
Under 5, the
list of Verbs
is not large. ^«TT

: ^T^TT,

; -^TTT,
to icasJi
; 'gT'TT,

:
^*fT,
to

These
are
probably nearly
all
the
\'erbs
to
be
included
in
this
class.
Such modifications as occur,
are few and simple.
Th'ese
modifications
are mainly
in the formation of
the
Perfect Participle.
In ^q'X and ^SfT, ^^e have f^^T and ^^^J for the
Perfect Participle
; and in those parts of the Verb where
the
stem
is
followed
by
a
vowel,
the

and
the
following

are compounded

instead
ot
^^TfT,
'^•^
"^5 ^HT,
we
have often HTTT
; so c[T^
for ^JjftT, ^^^- ^ee Paradigm
Xo.
7.
In %?fT
the ^
is
not changed
in this way,
but
re-
mains ^.
Frequently,
the
form %^^T
foi' this
Verb
is used,
in which case
it
comes
under the rules for
the
conjugation
of
a Verb,
the stem
of
which
ends
in
a
consonant.
Verbs,
the stems
of
which
end
in
^^ have
the ^
shortened
into ^ and a ^ inserted between this ^ and
the
following :^J^
in
the
formation
of
the
Perfect
Participle.
Thus
tft^TT,
f^^J
]
^•TT, ^^T
'not
always shortened).
The
other parts are regular.
With Verbs, the stems
of which end
in
^ft, ^^
is
inserted between the final
jjn" o^ the stem and
the ^J.
 
 
»v
in the formation of the Perfect
Participle.
Thus
?n*TT
becomes XmJ
', %T«TT, %T^T,
etc.
Here
also
the
other parts of the \'erb are conjugated
regularly.
With ^*TT
the vowel ^
is shortened
in the forma-
tion of
the
Perf.
Part.
;
thus
we
have
W^J.
The four Verbs mentioned under No.
(S are not
very
irregular.
The
full paradigm for ^Jr{J
is given
(Para-
digm Nos.

concerning ^n*TT will

be-
comes
44>i{|
for
the Perf.
Part.
In the case
of both
ma^T
and
ITTTT, the
forms
^T![ and
:|prj
are
in
use as
well
as |ch^| and ^4I7- This
is especially
true
of mi.
The
conjugation
of
the Passive
V^erb
has
been
al-
ready referred to under Paradigm No. 9.
When the Passive-Neuter Verbs have the ^\w\ [ com-
bined
with them (and
they very
largely do),
then they
are conjugated
in
all respects
in
the same
way
as the
Passive
N'^erbs.
The only
difference between these and
the Passive Verbs arises
before there
is
any question of
the conjugation
of them.
The Verbs come
up
for
con-
jugation in a different form,
e.<j., m^ WTTT and ^T^TT
WRT
; ^3 ^TRT and ^3T^ ^TTT.
When
^TRV
is not used with one of these Passive-Neuters, then
it
is
conjugated
as
an
ordinary
Intransitive
V^erb,
e.g.,
^m t, ^^n ^, ^^TT,
etc., etc.
211,
It will be noticed that the great
majority of Verbs
have
a
stem
consisting
of
only
one
consonant
and
its vowel, or this plus one
additional
consonant.
Thus
VTPX,— "Srir^—jHTT
5
etc.,
to which the
7{J
is ad-
ded to form the
Infinitive.
Some
stems, however,
have

«ECT.
211
MOODS, TENSKS,
ETC.
225
three
consonants,
e.(j., i^<d«il,
^"
"^'«^^'

/Jii.s7z. There is
also quite a large class
of Causal
Verhs
which
have
a
second vowel
(jITT)
added to
the
original
stem.
Thus
^m^, ^nTMT;
^ar^^^n,
^st^t; ^^m, ^^trt.
Sometimes
an
additional
consonant
is
brought
in
:
VERB: MOODS, TENSES, NUMBER. PERSON,
GENDER.
212-
Moods.
That
Moods
are
represented
in Hindi,
cannot be questioned, but the Tenses are
not
arranged
with reference
to any Moods, and there
is in
Hindi no
equivalent for
the word.
The matter may therefore be
dismissed from consideration.
Tenses.
In
Hindi,
there
is
a
term,
^|<rf
which
<:orresponds in meaning with
the English
" Tense,"
but
the
word
is not
largely used. A
Tense
is generally re-
ferred to by the word
x3f5^T,
Verb.
Thus we have such
terms
as
" Imperative
Verb,
Possible-Future
Verb,
Absolute-Future Verb. etc.
The order and
nomenclature of
the Tenses
adopted
is
that found
in
Dr. Kellogg's
Grammar, with
the ex-
15

226
THE VERB.
SECT. ,212
ception that, whereas Dr. Kellogg gives first the 6 Tenses
formed
from the
Imperfect Participle and
then the
six
formed
from the
Perfect Participle, the
twelve Tenses
are here given
in six pairs. Indefinite Imperfect, Indefinite
Perfect,
etc.
The
names
given
to
the
Tenses
well
represent the functions of
the respective Tenses, though
for each one no single name could be found which would
fully indicate the scope of
its use.
Number, Person
and
Gender.
The
Hindi
Verb has
two Numbers, singular and plural:
three Persons:
and
two Genders,
masculine
and
feminine.
In most
parts
of
the \'erb, the form
is affected by Number, Person and
Gender
; but in some parts, the influence of one or more
of
these does
not affect
the form
:
e.g.
The
Infinitive
mmy
be
.affected
by Gender
and
Number, but
not
by
Person.
The Contingent
Future
is
affected by Person
and Number, but not by Gender; so with the Imperative.
The
Conjunctive Participle
is
not
affected
by
any
of
the three.
Attention
is
again
called to
the
fact
that
the 2nd
and 3rd Persons singular of each Tense assume the same
form, also
the
1 st and
3rd
plural.
In
the
6 Tenses,
Indefinite
Imperfect
and
Perfect,
Past
Imperfect and
Perfect and
the Past Contingent Imperfect and
Perfect,
all
three
persons of the
singular are the same, likewise
the three persons of the plural.

Generally, the subject of
the Verb,
is expressed by a
Noun, Pronoun
or
some equivalent, but,
in certain sen-
tences,
may be
omitted, the person

indicated by
the form of the Verb or by the context,
e.g., the English,

Tenses toiined from the Perfect Participle, and the
Nominative icith
wf.
This
subject
has
already
been
referred
to
in
sections
95 and 202.
The
construction
only
affects
Transitive
Verbs,
and
of
these
only
the
six Tenses in
which the
form
assumed
by the
Perfect
Participle occurs,
viz
:—
Indefinite Perfect,
^T^fT.
Present

Past
Perfect, ^T^J ^T, Contingent
Perfect, H^X %T
Presumptive Perfect, ^T^T ^TTT, a"" P^st
Contingent
Perfect, ^T^T tTrTT-
No
attempt will
here be
made to
account
for
the
origin of
this peculiar construction.
It may be that the
N'erb
is,
in
this
construction, really
passive, and
that
what would ordinarily be
the Nominative
Case becomes
the Agentive, and what would have
been the Accusative
is changed into the Nominative, and remains Accusative,
or
is the Dative.
For
all
practical
purposes, however,
it may
be understood
that
what
was
the
Nominative

:228
THE VERB
SECT. 213
with
the
other Tenses, remains
still
the
Nominative,
though
with
a
special
form,
viz., the
addition
of
wf.
Sir George Grierson points out to me, and Dr. Kellogg
•takes
the
same
view,
that
these
Tenses
have
been
formed from the
Sanskrit
Past Paiticiple, and that the
construction
found
came
over
with
them
from
the
Sanskrit into Hindi.
In Hindi, however, the Passive force
of
the
Participle
appears
to
have
been
lost
in these
Tenses, and, on
the
whole, for
practical
purposes,
it
is
simpler to treat this construction, as has been
indicated
above.
With these
six Tenses, the use of this construction of
the
Nominative
with
»f
is
compulsory, but there
is a
choice
in
dealing
with
the
Accusative.
(Ij
the
form
with ^J ma\
be
used,
in which
case the
Verb
retains
the
form of
the 3rd
person,
sing,
masc,
throughout,
quite unaffected by
the
Gender, Number or
Person
of
either subject or object,
or, (2) the form
of
the Accusa-
tive without ^X
I or, as some would prefer
to say,
the
Nominative), may
be used, and then the Verb will agree
with this in Gender and Number.
«^*^

•^
Thus, whether
the Nom. be

H^»T,
\i'rrf^%
(or
their
equivalents),
the
form of
the

N'erb
is
quite unaft'ected,

'" Gender and Number,
thus
:—
By the alternative construction,
these would
all be
^. Thus... % ^x %T ^T,
etc.
: ^r{^ %5T t^;
As regards choice of these alternative constructions,
nothing
more deHnite
can be stated
than was
given in
considei-ing
the
choice
of
the two alternative forms of
the Accusative,
in section
97.
214.
There are
just
a
few Verbs, with
reference
to
which some uncertainty exists, as to whether this special
construction
should
be
used
or not.
One
of
these
is
^TT^'TT.
Sometimes the ^
is
used,
sometimes
not,

^^TTT,

This
last
is
not one
Verb, but
parts
of two
;
it is
the Verb ^TTT, preceded by the Conjunctive
Participle
of %^T.
Thus, ^^ ^:g% %T % nm,
^'•' took
off the
boy,
is ^ ^^% %T %9RT TTT,
written
in
a con-
tracted form.
In the case of ^TTTTj we have
a
similar
construction, with this
difference, however, that, where-
as the construction of the rest of the
sentence
has been
retained, the form of the Verb has been contracted in
all
its parts from % + JJCTTT to
<f|MT.

We must now deal with the Tenses and other
parts of

noting the
forms they
assume, their functions and idiomatic uses.
The
Infinitive. f^^W^ W^J.
218.
The
Infinitive
is formed
by adding w^" to the
stem of the \'erb. The Infinitive
is called by Hindi Gram-
marians fSRm^T^ ^T^T,
'•
'^^
<^
Noun
giving
the
meaning of a Verb, in other words, a Verbal Noun.
One of the Principal uses of the
Infinitive
is that of a
Verbal Noun or Gerund. As such,
it is liable to declension
in the same way as other Tadbhava Nouns ending
in j^J
and has the same Case modifications.
It is mostly used as
a masculine Gerund,
in the singular Number, but
is
also
used
in the fem
Tn"
^""^ the masc.
pi
%.
Sir George Grierson points out that this form
in
rfj'
is not only an
Infinitive, but also a Future Passive Parti-
ciple.
This may account
for the
fact that
the
idea
of
futurity
is markedly
present
in some
of
the idiomatic
uses of this
form ending
in «^.
As a Verbal
Noun,
it may sometimes be
translated
by the English
Infinitive, e.g.. ^'^ ^^TT g'^fK f%^
^^fX *TST,
^o
.7^' there
is not good
for yon.
In man}-
instances, however,
it
is necessary to translate the Hindi
Infinitive by one
of
the series of
English
words ending

in "
ing,
"
such
as
speaking,
talking,
singing,
cuuiing,
going, etc., these being equal to the Infinitive in meaning.
In the above
sentence,
the Hnglish
translation
may be
as given, or " Going there is not good for yon.
"
In many
instances, however, no such alternative
is open
in trans-
lating into English
; e.g., f^T3% % ^IT 'T^f^^TT,
lite xcork cannot he effected by writing.
Here '^writing
"
<:ould
not be
replaced by
" to write.''
The form of the
English
Infinitive is not so pliable as that of the Hindi.
The uses of the Hindi
Infinitive may be divided into
three groups
:
I.
As a Verbal Noun.
II.
Compounded with other
Verbs.
III.
As an Imperative.

Compounded with another V^erb.
The Infini-

is found
loosely
compounded
with other
\'erbs,
especially
in the Incept-
ive,
Permissive,
Acquisitue
and

groups.

in

III.
As
an
Imperative.
The
Infinitive
is
often
used
as
an Imperative.
Its
force
lies somewhere
bet-
ween
the other
two
forms
generally
in use. 4{||^^
is the very
polite form,
qf\f^\
is
an
ordinary command.
The Infinitive chi«il
''^^ somewhere between the two.
In
some sentences, the element of futurity
is
stronger than
in others.
Of course,
a
measure
of
futurity must
be
involved
in every order
or request, by the nature of the
case.
In some sentences
also
there
is a suggestion
of
continuity or repetition.
The use of the
Infinitive as an
Imperative does not, however,
necessarily carry the idea
of
either futurity
or repetition.

or ^1^?^,
i.e.,
the
Noun
which
explains
the
doing, or that which
is done or being done.
Possessing
much
in
common, these two Participles,
differ considerably.
One
very
important
difference
is
this
that, while the
Imperfect Participle
is
Active, the
Perfect
Participle, with
rfjjHJ
is
often
Passive,
e.g.,
TH^T% "^^ ^TH,
the taught icord.
Though, according
to the form, this might
be active,
it
is as
unmistaUeably
passive
as
though
it were written f%^TA T^H" ^TTtT.
In
the following
sentence,
the
Participle of
the
same
form
is very probably active,
^ff >^l|v| T^ ^T iV^^
^THTT 6>i1 1 '^^^TC A* t| *| g^
,

seeing that her sons
had
obtained the
kingdom, xcas pleased.
It may be safe
to
conclude that we have
not here
merely two different
uses of one form, but two
words which, though identical
in form, are not so in origin, one having probably been a
Sanskrit
Passive
Participle.

^40
THE VERB.
SECT. 222
The
Imperfect
Participle
is
formed
by
adding
lc{\
to the stem of
tlie
Verb, the Perfect by the
addition of
l^J.
With both Participles, "W*^ may be added.
In the
case of
the Imperfect Participle,
it changes the meaning
but very
little,
if
at
all.
Similarly, the
addition
to
the
Perfect
Participle
affects
the
meaning
little
in many
cases
; but, in some sentences, there is a distinctly passive
meaning.
Both Participles
are declined
like Adjectives
•of two termmations
;
masc. "^J.
pi. ^,
fem. W^
The
names, Imperfect and
Perfect, fairly
represent
the
essential
difference
between
the
two
Participles.
The former, in HT,
I'epresents
an
act
or
state
as
in
process
of
being done or
experienced,
i.e., as
not con-
cluded. The Perfect Participle represents
it as completed.

a letter.
f?T% ^^ ^^ 3^% ^"R ^ ^^'^j
Having
given
into
his
Juiiid
the
letters
which had
been
icritten.
The latter sentence illustrates also the
tendency for
the
Perfect Participle to assume a passive meaning.
Mr.
Platts,
in
his
Hindustani
Grammar
(sections
418-427,
in the 1904 edition),
has
an exceedingly
care-
fully
worked
out
note
on
the
Participles,
which,
in
the main,
applies
to Hindi
as
well as
to Urdu.
It may
be doubted, however,
if, in
all
cases, the
exact force of
the various uses of the participles, as there explained, can

SECT. 222
TENSES OF THE VERB.
241
be maintained.
It would rather seem that, frequently, the
adoption
of one or
other
of
alternative forms
or
con-
structions,— the agreement of the Participle with
its sub-
ject in Gender and Number, or its use in what is generally
called
its
Absolute
form, with ^^X
or without, etc.—
depends upon the fancy or taste of the writer or speaker,
and not on any rigid rule, just as,
in English, one writer
may prefer to write, "Going on his way, he was attacked,^'
another chooses
to write,
" As he went on
his
way, he
was attached."
223. With or without "SJ^J, Agreeing ^vith subject or in
Absolute fonn.
A careful consideration of the numerous
illustrations of the
use
of the
Participles which
will be
found
in
the following sections,
will,
it
is believed,
tend
to
confirm
the statement
made in
the last
paragraph.
Possibly, the forms with^^J
do tend to suggest some-
thing
in the
way of
continuousness,
but
it
is
certainly
not more than a tendency, and the same idea of continu-
ousness
is often present
where the ^>i{
\
is not
present,
e.g., ^T f^^ 5^^ ^K^ ^T %n 5^ ^^^ g^
%T ^TT ^T^T ^,
Spending money
on me
and seeing
me happy, displeases you.
The spending and seeing him
happy refer not
to one item of expenditure and one look
at the happy youth, but to a continuous expenditure, etc.

THE VERB.
SECT. 223
With the
Perfect
Participle
of a
Transitive Verb,
the
^jJTT
frequently
carries
with
it
the passive meaning
;
but its
use does
not involve this,
nor does
it have
any
such effect on the Imperfect Participle.
The Participle ma}^ agree with the subject to
which
it refers, in
Gender
and Number,
as
'^^'([rn' "^^ TTfTT
%T ^T^ ^X, Seeing her dying
mother.
Or, when used
predicatively after an Accusative, with ^J
it may
be
in
the
form
of
the
masc.
singular,
irrespective
of
the
Gender and Number of the subject of the Participle,
e.q.,
^q^ 5^ ^"'" ^^^^ Tim 133TT
(see
previous
sec-
tion).
Or,
it may appear in
the masculine
constructive
form.
This is frequently called the Absolute form, though,
strictly speaking, this word ought, perhaps, to be confined
to
those cases
in which
the subject
of the participle
is
not the same as the
subject of the main Verb in the sen-
tence, nor of an Accusative governed

It would be impossible, we believe, to formulate any
rule or
rules
stating
under
what conditions one
idiom
would be more
correct
than
another.
Undoubtedly,
in
some sentences, certain
constructions are
preferable,
in
some probably absolutely necessary; but in many instan*
ces alternatives are open, and the choice depends not on

Different authors
have
their preferences.

Various
uses of the Participles.
Perhaps the fol-
lowing represent the main uses of the Participles
:—
1.
As attributive
Adjectives.
2.
As
predicative
Adjectives
(see
paragraph
be-
low).
3.
As Nouns.
4.
As Verbal Nouns.
5.
Compounded with other Verbs.
6.
Special uses and idioms.
Frequently, the Participles do not assume
the func-
tions
of
Adjectives,
but
retain their
verbal force,
e.r/.,
^^ ^ ^^$5T ^m'i ^^^^1^ ^%J, The minister
thinking him
to
be a sinful man^ said.
Here
it
is ^^J*
that
is the Adjective, whilst the Participle, ^^)^;^ 3'wr
can only be styled adjectival
in a very loose sense.
The
Part, does not describe what
sort of a man the minister
was,
but gives
the thoughts
which led him to say what
he
did
say.
The force
of
the Part,
here
is far
more
verbal
than
adjectival.
The
sentence
might
equally
well have run, ^?^ WTH>^ % fe ^% T^^ ^^
^ ^ ^K^ ^^^T *T ^^.
Thus
written, we
have
an
ordinary Verb
to express
that
which
is
expressed
by the Participle in the other
sentence.

The Conjunctive Participle may con-

of the Verb
alone,
or may have added

'Efx^^ %j or ^^%«
Thus,

are ^J^
^T9R^, ^1%, ^^^^. Sometimes forms are
met
with
ending
in ^^^ ^^ and ^^
e.g.^ Wl^, ^T^%,

These must be
regarded
as dialectical forms, ra-
ther than as standard Hindi.
Of the
forms

that terminating

time.
The
form with ^ was
far more
used some
40
or 50 years ago than at present.
The simple stem
form
is
by
no
means uncommon,
and
the ^^^ form
is
occasionally
found.
If
there
be any
difference
in
the
use of
these various forms,
it
is this, that the stem form
is preferred when the Conjunctive
Part
is
very
closely
related
to
the
following
Verb.
In some cases, the two
might
be
taken
for a Compound
Verb,
e.g., ^ jI?T*fT-
This, we have seen,
does become a Compound
Verb
in
the contracted
form ^g*f (.
Notice ^
tj^t^X,
having
taken,
go
;
here,
frequently,
the
meaning
is,
Take
{it)
along.
The main advantage of having these alternative forms
is
not to convey any difference in meaning
or force, but
to
afford
variety
where
there
are
more
Conjunctive
Participles than one
in
a sentence.

it does indicate something which

ten-

two

demand
one
Contingent and
one

The ^J^

conditional
and quite
problematical.

This
uncertainty
is rightly expressed by the
Contingent
Future, but the statement made, that
if
this
conditition
be fulfilled " they will see," has no uncertainty involved
;
and therefore
in this case, the use of the Absolute Future
seems perfectly correct.
Most

1. The Definite Future.
Little explanation
is
needed
concerning this.
It
is the simple statement that
a certain thing will happen.
Necessarily, there
is uncer-
tainty
about the future,
but when
this
is
intended to be
made
prominent,
it
is
generally indicated
by a

It has been pointed out
that
the
forms often given
in Grammars for the

not belong
to the Imperative.
They are simply the forms of the Con-
tingent
Future copied out.
They
belong
to
the
Con-
tingent
Future, not to
the Imperative, being
hortatory,
not imperative in their force.
The
respectful
forms,
ckIHi^, ^f^l^T, ^-
y%^T, though rightly
included
in the
Imperative,
are,
strictly
speaking, not
imperatives.
They convey
not a
command, but a
request.

267
parent affinity with the simple Future as well as with the
Contingent Future form,
suggesting a comparison
with
such an English phrase as " Will your honour he pleased
to do so."
All three respectful forms presuppose the use
of
^Srnr,
o^' some similar title of
respect.
What
has been
written about the
use of
the Pro-
nouns applies fully here, and practically covers the matter
of the use of these
Imperative forms.
The 2nd singular
rnay be wisely neglected as regards using it, although, as
already stated, among Indians themselves, it is often used
with
children,
pupils and
others,
as
indicating
affection
and paternal
regard rather
than
conveying any idea of
contempt.
The plural
^fffj' may
be used in
addressing
servants and
others
in a
similar
position.
Of the res-
pective
forms, ehl l^lj
is the one most commonly used
;
^ll^^TIX
is generally reserved
for
persons of
great
dignity
; cH^f^ljl
is but little used.
In form,
it suggests
a 2nd person plural, and appears to be sometimes used in
addressing
numbers
of
people
together.
It
is by
no
means,
however,
confined
to
this.

THE TWELVE TENSES FORMED FROM THE
PARTICIPLES.
244.
We
have
now
to
consider
the
twelve
Tenses
formed from the Imperfect
and Perfect
Participles,
six
from each.
These
twelve Tenses naturally fall into
six
pairs,
the
first of each
pair
representing the
act as
in-
complete
(the
Imperfect
Participle),
the
second
as
complete
(from the
Perfect Participle).
In either
case,
the time referred to may be
past, present or future,
but

SECT. 244
TENSES OF THE
VERB.
269
the action
is either complete or incomplete,
respectively,
at
the time referred
to.
The point can be
easily
illus-
trated by
English sentences.
Re was
making
it
; He
is
making it; He
ivill he making it: He had made
it; He
has made it ; He will have made
it.
These sentences
in
Hindi
would be
rendered by Tenses
formed
from
the
Imperfect
and
Perfect
Participles,
though,
as a matter
of fact, there
is no Tense in Hindi exactly corresponding
with the
English
Future- Perfect.
It
is
true there
is a
literal equivalent, ^^^ 3^%T ^•TTTT ^TT,
^"<^ the
literal translation
of
this
might
deceive
one
and
give
the
impression
that
we
had here
an
exact
equivalent.
The
literal translation of the sentence
is, " He will have
made
it,'^ not, however, with
the meaning of
the Future-
Perfect,
but of
the Presumptive Perfect.
The sentence
does not mean
in
Hindi
that
at some
future
time he
will
be in the
position of one who has
done
the
work,
but
that
the
conviction
of
the speaker
is
that
he
has
already
made whatever
is
being
spoken
abont.
This
point
is thus elaborated
to make the student realize that
the
Hindi
Tenses
do not always
exactly correspond in
meaning
and
scope
with
English
Tenses
which
are
their nearest
equivalents.
The
student
will,
however,
find
that Hindi
is capable of
giving very
full and exact
expression, through its Verb, of many niceties, as regards

270
THE VERB.
SECT. 244
time,
etc.
When
not
capable
of
expression
by
the
Tenses of
the ordinary Verb, there are always available
various Compounds,
very
pliable
and
effective.
Take
an
illustration.
We wish to
say that
a person
is com-
ing,
meaning
that he
has already left
his house
and
is
actually on the way.
^3"
jJTTHT
i^. Re is coming, might
express
this,
but
does not necessarily do
so, as the sen-
tence
is
ambigucus,
as
ambiguous
as
the
English,
" Christmas
is coming."
The Hindi may
might express
what we wished it to, but might also mean that, he is about
to come,
or that, he is in
the habit of coming.
We have,
however,
only
to use the phrase, ^^
jJfT ^^ ^, and
all
is clear as daylight.
This means that the coming has
been started
and
is
still proceeding—he is
actually
on
the road.
As we consider the twelve Tenses one by one,
it will
become manifest that each one
does
not
exactly
carry
out the
functions
which are arranged
for
it
in the
ad-
mirable scheme presented.
The symmetry
is not
quite
,
so exact as
at first appears,
e.g., the Past Perfect
is
not
exactly
equivalent to the
English Pluperfect,
*' he
had
gone,"
etc.
It
may
mean
that,
often
it
does
not.
Recognizing
these
facts,
the
statement
may
still
be
maintained that the Hindi Verb
is very scientific in
its

THE INDEFINITE IMPERFECT.
245.
That
difficulties
exist
with
reference to this
Tense may be inferred from the
fact that Indian Gram-
marians appear
to
be
unable
to agree about
its name.
Much of
the difficulty possibly
arises from this, that the

272
THE INDEFINITE IMPERFECT.
SECT. 245
form of this Tense is often used as a contraction for other
Tenses.
Some
Hindi
scholars
have gone
so
far as
to
take
the
position
that
there
is
no such
Tense
as
the
In-
definite Imperfect, but
that this
form
is
always
a con-
traction
to express
some other Tense and that
its place
is only assigned
to
it
in
the scheme
of Tenses, for the
sake
of
symmetry.
We
shall,
however, see
that
the
Tense
is a real one and quite a serviceable one.
The Tense refers to an action (or experience)
as
ac-
tually proceeding,
still unfinished,
but contains no refer-
ence
to the time
xvhen the
action takes place
;
it might
have been
going on
in
the past,
it may be proceeding in
the
present,
it
may belong
to the future.
An
English
sentence may help to show how reference may be
made
to an action as actually proceeding, with no reference to
the time
of
its
occurrence.
"A
vkiu
sijeculates, he he-
comes involved in financial difficulties, he grows desperate^
he blows his
brains
out.'"
It
is a suppositious
case
o}
what may have happened, what may be
happening, what
may happen at some future
time.
Somewhat
similarly
with this Indefinite Imperfect, but with important
differ-
ence.
It
is seldom used in a sentence like the above
; the
Hindi has two clauses, the first
conditional,
the
second
indicating something in the way of the outcome from the
condition
referred to
in the
first clause,
the Indefinite

SECT. 245.
THE INDEFINITE IMPERFECT,
273
Imperfect
being used in
both clauses,
^fl" ^ff^T e|^'
'Tll'ini, S^ "^^^0 goes knoics.
There
is no
reference to
time,
let
the
condition
be
carried
out,
at any
time,
let
a man
''go,'"
and
the /i'/?oi^Zerf^e will be
gained.
It
is
in such sentences that this Tense
is mostly employed
;
the application may be to universal truths or
to
circum-
stances
arising in the life of an individual.
?r^ \^'^ T^ ( ^I^T understood in the second clause,
but
unexpressed, unnecessary with •T^t), ^^
^*^''^^ does
not
give his Jting sound advice, is not liis

it
is not
a general truth that
is given
but the circumstances
in an
individual
life.

In
the following
there
may
be
a
reference

if so, the Indef. Imperf. would be used for the Past
Contingent, but the statement
is fairly general
and
the
Tense
is probably the Indef.

it means, on your

If you only make the slightest effort, then the enemies will
not escape from being entangled in a network of difficulties
from all directions.
Not
infrequently,
the
sentence does
refer
to
some
special time, but the indications of that reference are not
contained
in
this
Tense,
but
conveyed
in
some other
way,

Here the
fact
that
the

is
to

is contained
in fTT^%

Very often, when the

is
used,
the
full form
is
not

in

takes
its
place.
This
will
be illustrated
under the
Past
Contingent
Perfect
Tense.
INDEFINITE PERFECT. ^ITT'^^fT
252.
The
most common
use of
this Tense
is
to
express the simple fact that something was done, or that
something occurred, in
the past,
without any indication
as
to
the
exact
time
when
it
occurred.
The
Tense
might
well be
called
" The
Vague Past Tense."
Any
information
about
the time
when,
is
indicated
not
by
this Tense, but by some additional words of the sentence,
e.g., SR^ ^ 'SnBr^ ^^? Upon
hearing {this) he
said.
The Tense
equals such English
phrases as
" he went,''
" he did
it,'' "he said,"
etc.
The uses of the Tense may be given as below
:
253.
1.
Indefihite
Past.

3. Sometimes it bears a meaning in which the
force of
the
Contingent Perfect
plays
some
part.
It
really
becomes a
kind of

indicating
the
possibility of
something
that will
have
happened
in
the future.

257,
In
the
case
of
perhaps
all
these
Tenses
which
are
formed from the combination of a Participle
and some auxiliary, a
consideration
of
the
two
parts
separately
often
renders
considerable
help
in
under-
standing the exact force of
the
Tense.

With
Neuter verbs,
caution
is
necessary' as
to the
may
be correctly trans-
lated,
" he is going," but
what exactly does
this mean ?
In English, the general meaning would be, " he is about
to go,
" and
it might be, he is aetually moving on his
loay.
In
Hindi,
the
latter
is
the true
idea
involved
in the
Tense, though
it might mean the former. ^^ ^IfTT ^
may
mean
(1)
He
is

(2)

The

uses may be noticed.

that,
in English, we might use this,
e.
g., I have

twice,
instead
of
I

Probably,
the reason
of
the
construction,
both
in
the
Hindi
sentence
and
in
English,
is
this that the point
under
consideration
is
not
the actual meetings; but the
present slight familiarity with the man that rests on
the
fact
of having
met him once or twice.
The f^^
has
more of
its distinctly
participial force
than
is
usual in
the Present Perfect.

modifications

may be

THE PAST PERFECT.
jntTHfT-
260.
According
to the scheme of the
Tenses, this
ought
to
equal
the
English
Pluperfect.
As
the
Past
Imperfect
represented
the
subject
of
the verb in
the
past
as
actually engaged
in the
action
indicated
by the
verb, so this Past Perfect should represent him
as
being
in the position
of one
who had
already
completed
the
action,
i.
e., Past Imperfect, he
vjas-\~ivriting,i.
e., he tvas
wi'iting
; Past Perfect, he nxis + hoving tcriften,
i. e.Jie had
T
written.
The
Hmdi
Um4jfl'
however,
does
not
defi-
nitely, express
this
;
it
does not,
generally, as does the
English Pluperfect, express
the
fact that
something had
been
completed
before
another
event
occurred,
but
simply
states
the
fact
that something
did occur
in
the
past.
The main difference
between
this Tense
and the
Indefinite
Perfect
(4j |4||«^VTrT)
is
this that
this JTW"
HH
indicates
a
more remote
past.
This
Tense
may,
and
at
times
does,
equal
the
English
Pluperfect,
but
does not do so as a rule.

force

These
two Tenses
are
conditional
in
their
general use.
In the
protasis,
the Tense
is used
to
ex-
press the condition, and in the apodosis to indicate what
would
have been the result
had the condition
been, or
not
been,
fulfilled.
In

is frequently contracted and
sometimes
another

THE IMPERSONAL VERB.
^TTWITTR Qh^i .
268.
The Hindi Impersonal V^erb does not correspond
with
the English verb bearing
that name, but cannot be
denied
a right to being so called.
In form,
it
is the same as the Passive X'erb, the main
Verb
assuming
the form
of
the
Perfect
Participle and
-being followed by the Verb ^\w\\.
As
there
is no No-
minative
for
the
Participle
or
N'erbal ending to
agree
with,
the
Verb
always
remains
in
the
form
of
the
3rd
person,
singular,
masculine.
Practically, the par-
ticipal
part
of
the
Verb
is
the
subject, and
is equal
to a Verbal Noun- 3^ ^\^\
•Tflf ^fTT,

THE PASSIVE-NEUTER VERB.
269.
We
venture
to
give
this name
to
a very
numerous class of Hindi Verbs which are Passive, foras-
much as the state of the subject of
the Verb
is brought
about
by something
other than
any action on the part
of
that subject, and
yet forasmuch
as
the
instrument
of
the
action
is
not generally
stated, or indicated,
the
Verb
is not
a
trne
Passive^ in the
ordiriar}-
acceptance
of
that term, but
has more affinity with a Neuter Verb.

294
THE PASSIVE-NEUTER VERB.
SECT. 269
e.(j.
For the true Pas:iive, we may have ^^g
T^^TTTr
^ CHI C, The tree is being shaken.
It may be mentioned,
or
not mentioned,
that
it
is shaken by the wind or by
some person, but the Verb
is Passive and the
indication
clearly made that the shaking
is caused by some person
or
thing
; but
in
the sentence,
^!g 1%^ ^STIrTT ^
(o>'
f^^TTTT ^', the
form of the Verb
is the Passive-Neuter,
and attention
is drawn only to the
simple
fact
that the
tree shakes.
It may be logically inferred that the shaking
did
not
originate
without
some
cause, but
the
Verb
makes
no reference
to any
cause and has no concern
with
the fact
as to whether there was
a cause
or not.
The one single import of the Verb
is to set forth the fact
that the tree shakes.
In English, there are a few Verbs
which
are both
Transitive
and
Intransitive, and
thus
lend
themselves to a similar
double use, e.g.
The pipe
burst.
(No
reference
to,
hoic\)
The
pipe
was
burst
(suggesting
that
this
was
due
to
a
sudden
thaw,
or
something of
the
kind).
Again, The papers ivere burnt;
Passive, the mind of the reader naturally gathering that
some one burnt them, or
that in a general
fire they had
been
burnt, or
something of
a similar character.
The
fire was burning.
Here we have a pure Neuter Verb.
In
Hindi, we need
not
use
the
same Verb
in
two

SECT. 269
THE PASSIVE-NEUTER VERB.
295
ways,
forasmuch
as
a
very
large number of
Verbs
is
provided for which thel'e are two forms, an Active form,
of
which the
Passive form
can be
used, and, from the
same root as the Active, a
Passive-Neuter form.
Thus
i^<«|r||
and
<^(«|*i'l.
LIsing the first, we may have the
sentence R^>d|chT ^t^Tl IMl, The
wieket was
opened.
VVe infer
that some one opened
it. f'^^^u
<3tf| T^tt,
The wicket opened.
Here the thought
is in no
way
di-
rected to any consideration as to how the opening occur-
red, the one
fact to which the attention of the writer and
the reader is directed
is that the wicket became open. So,
again, ^RFT^t^l^rnn'frT, The wood was burnt (Passive).
<d4i^l ^^ ^l^i, The
wood burnt
CNeuter). ?|^ "SppT^
f^TTnTtT^, This matter was concealed. 71^ (^IJ 4|^|^
This iviaii) was hidden.
Attention
is simply drawn to the
fact that the man disappeared
; no reference
is made
or
suggested as to
his being concealed by anyone.
VV^ith the one series of Verbs, the forms, construction
and meaning are those of the true Passive Verb
:
in
the
other, the meaning has close affinity with the true Neuter
Verbs, and the form and construction are
not Passive.
One
special
feature
of these Passive- Neuter
Verbs
demands notice.
^TT^TT

this 'STPTTj
however, the form of the Perfect participle is
not used (as
is the
case with the Passive Verb)
but
the
stem,
e.g., ^f^ WTTT,
not ^T^TT ^TTTT- Thus we may
have
the
two
forms
for
the
Passive- Neuter
4a«f|r||
or ?3^ ^TTT,
f^ open.
In
the
Indefinite
Perfect,
the
form would almost invariably
be

in
the
Future the form TS'^nTT ^vould
probably
be
more
fre-
quently found than ^^ ^IT^TT

another
Verb, TJJCTT or

the Indefinite Perfect would
almost
invariably be T^ ^fHTT, but in
the
Future T^

• Speak-
ing generally, we find that the ^THTT
'^ very much
used
with the Past Tenses, not so much
with the Future.
It may be asked, Why this addition of the >9(Ml
^t
all ?
Some might state, and do state,
that
the ^n*TT
's inten-
sive.
A
careful consideration of a large number of
sen-
tences in which this ^X*TT occurs
with
these
Passive-
Neuters,
will make
it
evident
that,
in most
cases, this
suggestion about
intensity,
has no support whatever. A
more plausible suggestion
is that, as ^|'r| \
is
indicative
of the
Passive, its addition to these Verbs is appropriate,
forasmuch
as
they
are
in one
respect
Passive.
This
appears
to
be
a
reasonable
suggestion.
The question
still remains, How
is
it that sometimes the ^ffcTT addition

SECT. 269

297
is used, sometimes not ?
To this question, the only safe
and sound answer appears to be,
*' Because
it is.'
It
is
a matter of
usage.
Why
is
it
that
in English we
may
say
" a big house,''
" a
larcje house,'^ but, while allowed
to say
" a

girl,'* the
phrase
" a

Here,
however,
one
can
see
a
measure
of
appro-
priateness in the use of
the
Passive-Neuter,
forasmuch
as
the
instrument
was
not
a

instrument.

Here,
again,
we
notice
the
instruments
are
not
conscious
instruments.
Another indication of the favour which these Passive-
Neuter forms obtain
is found in the fact that some Verbs
which
are
ah-eady
Neuter
assume a shortened
form,
more characteristic of the Passive-Neuters,
(•.-/.,

the use of the Pass. -Neuters

The
first
point
to
notice
in
considering the
Causal Verbs is that many Verbs which are causal in forni
are
not,
strictly speaking,
Causal Verbs,
e.rj., (M^MT
is
a
true
Causal,
it
means,
to
cause
to

the
first form
of the Verb being
in''»TT5

but
it
is
a misuse
of
language
to
call

former
is
an

Verb, meaning,
to
pare, to scrape, to
peel
; and
there
is
a
Passive-Neuter form
of the Verb '(^^ ^TPTT, which
means,
to he pared, etc.
The true Causal Verb indicates
the causing of another to do something, instead of doing
it
oneself,
e.g., '^K^\
(Trans.),
to do, ^TCTfT
(Causal)
to
cause
aiiother
to
do ;
but
to
call
a
Verb
a
Causal
because
it
signifies
that
something
is
caused
to
take
place,
is
rather
a
twisting
of
language
and
likely
to
cause
confusion.
^vjTHT i^ Causal in form,
but
not
so
in
meaning
;
it
simply
means,
to
make.
From the same stem there is a Pass.-Neut.
Verb, ^vfcTX
or ^^
>3||vt I,
to
he made.
q|*||v||
is actually an ordi-
nary Active Transitive Verb.
And
the Causal of this
is
8|«|e| 1*11,
to cause another
to
make,
to
have
something
made hy anotlier.
As in the
present section,
our
chief concern
is with
the form
of
these
so-called
Causal
Verbs,
bearing
in

302

SECT.
271
mind
what
has
been
written
above,
we
may
accept
the loose nomenclature and speak of Causal Verbs, even
though they are not strictly so in meaning.
We should,
however, recognize
that even
as regards form
it might
be
as
correct, or more
correct, to
regard
8|*j|«{|^
to
be
made,
as a shortened form
of ^vTpfT,
as
to
insist on
the
latter
being
the
Causal
form
from
^?fvTT.
For
convenience of treatment, howevei
. we accept
the
latter
course and note the changes of form on that basis.
272.
For
the
sake of clearness, with
reference
to
the force and meaning of these different classes of Verbs,
it
is suggested
that
the
student
might do
well
in
the
course of his reading to work out a tabulated
list of Verbs
on somewhat the lines adopted
in the following table.

SECT.
272

304

SaCT. 273
CAUSAL VERBS.
305
273.
The
most simple form of
the Causal Verb
is
in
the
case
of
a
Verb, the stem
of
which
ends
in
a
consonant preceded by a short vowel
;
the Causa
is often
then
formed
by
adding ^J
to
the
stem for the
First
Causal and ^J for the Second
Causal.
Thus
:—
^^•TT,
to
ascend,
^ST*TT,
^^
cause
to
ascevd.
r{^c{ Ml,
to
cause
another
to
cause
a
third person
to
ascend.
^^^T,
^^
^'*''''^-
si3MI,
^^ maJ:e
another rise.
As
will be
shewn, other stems, and even
the stems
spoken of above,
may
have the
Causal form formed in
other ways.
In
not a
few instances, the
idea
expressed
by
the
Causal form
may
be
expressed
by
a
single
word
in
English,
e.g.,
I4(^r||
to read; ^^T«TT, to cause another
to
read, that
is,
to
teaeh\; ^nTTT,
to
wahe up
;
^fTlTTT,
to icahe (another person).
With some Verbs in the Causal form, the meaning
of
the Verb
is modified in other ways, besides being
causal.
e.g., %T^*TT,
to
speah,
or,
to
utter
a
sound
;
Causal,
^^flTTT, means to call
( ^^ %T
^^dl^iTl,

the
force of our
slang phrase,
"
knocking a
little
sense
into anyone.''
Second
Causals are
not in
use with
all the
Verbs.
It will
be
noted
that, what appears as a Second Causal
in
form, may
only be
a
First Causal
in meaninq,
e.g.,
•^<t|c|I^T, ^H«<MT;
the
earlier forms,
^aTT'TT and
"5r«n*rr
^^^ "^t truly
Causals in meaning,
but
Active
Transitive
Verbs,
meaning
to
play
(an
instrument), to
make.
^^^|*TT therefore, simply means,
to
cause
an-
other to play
: ^^T^T^TT,
^^ cause another to make.
That
is, they are, in meaning, only First Causals.
The question sometimes
arises with
regard to
some
of
these Causals as to the Cases governed by them,
e.g.,
in the sentences, ^r§% %T 'CTST T^^rTSn', or
XTpn"
ft^T^, do fe^TRT and
Ttf^"RT
take two
Accu-
satives,
or
only
one?
If
only one, which
is the Accu-
sative, what
case
is
the other word ?
"J^TCT and
"'TT'TT
are the Accusatives; ^^^ ^T
's Dative.
The bread is
the Accusative, whether
I eat
it or cause
another to
eat
it.
The use of
another
Causal Verb may
help to clear
this matter. ^^ §iX <^|c<HT W, I
see
the
house
;
5f,
5r5% ^T ^ f^^^^rnrr ^,
^
•5'^'^''-' t^^ house to the hoy.
The idiomatic use of
TfT^TT involves a similar
diffi-
culty.
We
speak
of
striking
a
horse
with
a
whip,

SECT. 273
CAUSAL VERBS.
307
making the horse the
Accusative.
In Hindi, the whip
is
the
Accusative,
the horse
Dative. ^ ^ft%T %T ^T'^[^
41Kn ^5 They were heating the horses with
lohips.
The
idiom really works out—They were striking
the whips to
the
horses.
Almost
invariably, in
Hindi,
it
is
the
in-
strument
with which
the striking is done, that
is in the
Accusative, the person struck in the Dative.
274.
The
changes made
in
forming
these Causal
torms
will now be noticed
and examples
given.
Again,
the attention of
the student is
directed to
the fact
that
it is the Causal forms that are now to be dealt
with,
not
the meanings.

insert ^ before

others have no

VERBS FORMED FROM NOUNS, ETC.
279. Some few Verbs are found in
Hindi formed
from
Nouns
and
other
Parts of Speech.
These
Verbs
are
formed by the
addition of
>i| |r|T
and

one
of
such
a
phrase
in
English
s^s " the play was staged/'
for "
putting on the stage.
"
These Verbs are found
most
largely
in
colloquial
speech
or
in
verse,
but
must certainly be regarded as
part
of
the
language.
A

ONOMATOPOETIC VERBS.
SECT. 280
ONOMATOPOETIC VERBS.
280. Onomatopoetic words are abundant in Hindi.
The
Verbs
are
formed
by
the
addition
of »JTT*fT
^^ some
word,
or
sound, representing
the cry of an
animal
or
some
other
sound.
In
this
class
of
Verbs should be
placed
also
the
Verbs
which
do not attempt to imitate
some sound, but seek to suggest by sound some
special
appearance,
e. g., ^?Tt|4<|HT,
to
glitter
: :g^^^-RT,
to
gloii' ;
H^^^\r[\, to he in a flutter, or fluster. (Com-
pare
the similar
English
attempts
in
such words
as,
sparkle, glitter, dazzle, etc.
). To what extent these words
convey
through
the
ear what
is
seen by the eye, may
depend
in
some
measure
on
the
imagination
of
the
hearer.
Indians
seem
to
possess
a perfect genius
for
inventing onomatopoetic words.
^{rQ^'9T*TT strikes one
as
a
very
successful
attempt
to produce
an imitative
Verb for, to xihisper.
So with ^^^^5T*TT or ^p^^J^rfT,
to grumble.
It
is interesting to note how
nearly
identical
some
of
these
Hindi
and
English onomatopoetic words
are,
e.g., T^iMKV^ '"
Hindi
for
expressing
the murmuring
of the wind in trees:
in i^Hf^HHT' we have
the neigh
of English, only the " n " and
*' h " are in reverse order.
As this is a Grammar,
not a Dictionary, no attempt
will

COIVIPOUND VERBS.
^tF fe^T-
281.
Compound Verbs abound in Hindi.
They vary
greatly
in their
formation and use, but
it
is not difficult
to broadly classify them.
I.
In the first
division may
be included
all
those
Compound Verbs in which two words are joined, giving,
generally, one
Verbal idea.
The
first Verb
makes the
main
contribution
to
that
idea,
but
the
second may
modify the force in some way.
Of the earlier Verb only
the stem
is used.
This
is subject to no changes through-

316
COMPOUND VERBS.
SECT.
281
out
the
conjugation, and
thus
the
Compounded
Verb
becomes,
both as
regards meaning and conjugation, one
compound
word.
Examples,
f'TiCT ^T^T,
f^
obliterate,
to blot out
; TCm %«TT, ^o obey
; ^f^ ^3»TT,
to Jlare up,
either literally, as a
fire, or metaphorically, in a rage.
This class may be called Close Compounds.
II.
The second class may include those Compounds
in
which each
Verb retains, more or
less fully,
its own
proper
meaning.
The
earlier
is
often used
in
its
Infi-
nitive
form (inflected or uninflected), or
the stem alone,
the second member of
the Compound only being subject
to
the
usual inflectional changes.
Examples,
>ai|r| ^5fT
to permit to go', X^^ ^^*TT, ^^ begin to weep
; ^^ ^^'^j
to finish speaking
; ^^ ^^5115
^'^ be able to rise.
This
second class
may be
called, Loose Compound
Verbs.
III,
The
third
class
includes those
Compounds in
which
the
first
member
is
a Noun,
or,
occasionally,
an Adjective, Adverb or Postposition.
Examples,
^PFTT
^^'TT, to forgive
; f^T^ ^-TT, to appear
; "q^^ <*>l*il„
to
follow
; ""Vr^ ^^T,
to put behind
; SJT^^T ^?^5TT,
to
heal, malte well.
This
third class
may
be
called
Noun-Verbal Com-
pounds.

SECT. 282
CLOSE COAIPOUND VERBS.

I.
CLOSE COMPOUND VERBS.
282.
Whether
the origin of these Compounds must
be placed
side by side with that love of
doubling a word
which
is a characteristice of
Hindi,
is a question
which
we
need not attempt to decide.
Certain
it
is that these
doubles
are
widely
prevalent
in
Hindi.
The
second
member
of
the Compound
may
tone
the
force of
the
earlier
word, or somewhat modify its sense,
but
it seldom
makes
any
distinct
difference to
the
meaning.
In the
partnership, the first word supplies
the capital, the second
is the working
partner
; for, although the
first dominates
the
meaning
and power
of
the
Compound, the
conju-
gational
changes
fall
entirely
on
the
latter.
Perhaps
the nearest parallel in English to this class
of Compounds
is
in
such
colloquial
phrases
as, I'll
give a look at
it
;
ril take a walk ; Til have a swim.
Dr. Kellogg
takes
the
form
of
the
first
word
in
these
Compounds
as
the
Conjunctive
Participle,
It
seems, however, simpler and
safer
to
regard
it
as
the
simple
stem,
as
there
is
nothing
of
the
force of the
Conjunctive
Participle
in
the
use
of
the
first
word.
This may
be
illustrated
by
the
following. ?^
>g(|>l|^
has two possible meanings,
1.
Having eaten
^ go.
Here
^X
'^
^^^
Conjunctive
Participle,
but
the
two
Verbs
do
not
constitute
a
Compound
Verb.
2.
Eat away.

CLOSE COMPOUND VERBS,
SECT. 282
This
is
the Compound
Verb,
and
in
this
there
is
no
suggestion of the Conjunctive Participle.
Sometimes, the
second member
of
the
Compound
,
may
strengthen, intensify,
or otherwise
affect the
force,
of
the
earlier
word,
but
in
many cases
it does
not,
but
can
only
be
regarded
as an
alternative
way
of
saying what would
be
expressed
by
the
simple
Verb.
In

with

Take the following sentence

In
the
following sentence, however, who can say that %5fT
adds any additional force ? ^3RT 3f^ ^% ^ Zi^ ^

^" some
instances,

of ^n*TT

somewhat
with

invariably used with some,
not so invariably with others.
With

the
Noun

Verb
are so fully compounded that they

govern
another
Noun
in
the
Accusative
Case
;
in the second
Class,
the
com-

is
less

remains
related

the
other
Nouns
in
the
sentence
as
though
it
were
not
compounded
with
the
Verb,
and
is
itselt
governed
by
that Verb.
This distinction

may
be
well
illustrated
by

^t^^TT,

forgive,
are
examples of the first Class, the fully Compounded Verbs.
In the case of
the great majority of
the
V^erbs now
under consideration, the compounding
is not fully carried
out
; the Noun which
is more or less joined to the ^^vfj
is
related
to
other Nouns in the
sentence,
as
though
it
were
not
an integral part of
the \'erb, and in
truth
it
is not so.
Among
such
not

Compounded
Verbs
come
words like ^^J ch<«TI,
^« display mercy
:
^^TT ^T'TT,
to
afford
protection
 
^M\
cR^*TTj
to
offer
worship
;
W^TTtTT
cfii^v^T,
io render

In

appropriate Verb to use with each
Noun

of
its
wealth
of words.

to do help.
Other
Verbs
are used in these Compounds, such
as
^^T, %5TT, tRT, mxm, ^TK^i
but
^^srr
is
the
favourite Verb for these Compounds.
Not
only
are Nouns joined
up in
this
way
; occa-
sionally, an Adverb, or
Adjective,
or
even
Postposition
may
be joined
up,

^^«n> ^o

; ^ft^ ^1^«rr, to hasten
; tft% iniHl,

to pursue.
No attempt will be made to

SYNTAX OF THE VERB.

The
matter
of
agreement
between
the
Verb
and
its
Nominative and
Accusative,
has
already
been
dealt with
in
sections, 142-144, and
the
position of
the
Verb,
in the sentence in section
147.
Many other points

SECT. 307
SYNTAX OF THE VERB.
341
have also come under
consideration
in the
various sec-
tions on the Tenses, etc.
One or two other points, more
or less related to Syntax, may now be noticed.
Subject of
the
Verb
unexpressed.
The
omission of
the subject is more common
in
Hindi
than
in
English.
This
is natural when
it
is
remembered
that
in
many
parts of the Verb the Verb itself
indicates
whether
the
subject
is sing, or plural
;
masc.
or
fem.
With
those
Tenses of Transitive Verbs which
are
formed
from the
Perfect Participle this
is not the case.
Another
disabi-
lity under which Hindi
suffers
is the
lack of a
3rd
per-

In

in Hindi, the Verb is repeated, but (often) no Pronoun

The use of a Participle
instead
of
a second
principal Verb.
A Conjunctive
Participle,
or
ordinary

generally
supplies
the
place
which
a
second
Verb would occupy in
a corresponding
English
sentence.

Omission of Auxiliary.
It has

Not, infrequently what

the Verb ^TTT, pi't^ceded by a Participle.
Thus, ^ ^ST

314.
In dealing
with Suffixes,
it may be
better to
use another method than that adopted
in the section on
Prefixes.
There we
pursued the
alphabetical
order.
It
is
proposed
to throw
the Suffixes into
groups,
so that
some light may be thrown upon the systematic formation
of
the Compounds, which will now
be considered,
viz.,
Nouns
and
Adjectives (some
of them used
as
Nouns)
formed
from a
Verb
or Noun
base, by the
addition
of
a Suffix.
There
are
two
main
groups
:
I,
called
by
Indian
Grammarians d^^vri, which
have a
Verbal
base,
and
II. rll^^,
vvhich have a Noun as a base.

Indian Grammarians have worked
out the divisions
and
sub-divisions
with
great
elaboration
and
much
ingenuity.
Pundit
Aladhava
Prasad
Pathak,
in
his
" Hindi

Vyakaran,
"
has done a very
useful
piece
of work
in
this
special
section, and
I
gratefully
acknowledge
the
help
I
have
derived from him in the
order here adopted.
It
has not
been thought
necessary to work out the
details of
the euphonic
changes which
often take place
in
the
original word
in adding
the
suffixes.
They are
interesting, but not absolutely necessary, for the student,
who
will hardly
be expected
to enter
on
the
task
of
forming new words, but, for a time, at least, will content
himself with ascertaining
the meaning and
use of those
already formed.
Many of the changes, and the suffixes themselves, are
Sanskrit, but
they belong
to
Hindi,
forasmuch
as the
words
are widely current
in Hindi, and new words
are
being formed from time to time.
VERBAL NOUNS.
«f^??T
315.
These words are formed from
a
X'erbal
base,
supplemented by what
is called a 3f^rT37^T^
i-^-, a Suffix
which
conveys a
further
verbal force
to the word with
which
it is united.

sentence, called an
Adverbial
Extension.
It
will
be noticed that some words appear in
lists of
Postpositions which have already
appeared as
Adverbs,
and
some
of these same words are Nouns also. Day
is
a Noun, and yet
in the sentence, "He did it day by day,"
(daily;,
it
is truly an Adverb.
Words
do thus change in
their character, as they are used in different ways. In 3^%
•fv% WW[
^, What is under it 7 v||^

Postposition.
In the sentence, gf^ ;TT% mT^j

PRONOMINAL ADVERBS.
We
have
ah'eady
noted
the
series of
Pronominal
Adjectives
in
which
the
characteristic
letters
of
the
Pronouns appear and modify the meaning.
In a similar
way, we have a series of words adverbial
in their
force,
and
these have
been suitably
denominated Pronominal
Adverbs.
In the following
lists,
it will be observed that,
1.
are
related to the

the Pronominal Adjectives of Quantity, l^'rfJfT,

Sect.

are used as Adverbs
of Degree,

are not
generally inflected.

^X, sometimes '^,

intensive Adverbial
Par-

The ^

the

Case-signs
are
as
truly
Postpositions
as
those dealt with
in the present Chapter
:
it is only their
identification with the
Case system that has led to their
separation.
These words correspond with the English Prepositions,
but as they are almost invariably used after
the word to
which
they
are
related, they have
been
appropriately
called
Postpositions.
The Hindi name, ^T^;=^iT^^^
>^o«4<|,
the particle indicating relation,
is excellent.
Dr.
Kellogg
has
pointed
out
that
many
of
these
Postpositions
were
originally
Nouns.
This
accounts
for the fact that, with some of
them, the related word
is

The English

Conjunction,
is exceed-

unsatisfactory,
as
it
by
no means
covers
the

Indian
Grammarians extend
the

using
two names,
Conjuncton

Disjunction. Even
this, however, does
not fully meet the case.
In the
following paragraphs, the endeavour will be
made
to
group
the

Among

assured that many of them not only use these

is followed by the

Hindi
literature
is
written
in
JJcJ^,
Prose,
and
tj^j
verse.
Since
the
beginning
of
the
19th
century,
prose
has been
steadily
gaining
ground
and
may now ba considered to have taken
the place of
verse
for
the general
diffusion of
knowledge.
Up to
the end
of
the 18th century, practically
all Hindi
literature was
written
in
verse.
Not
only were
the
subjects
usually
relegated
to the
domain of
verse in
English so treated
in
Hindi, but
all subjects
were
thus
dealt
with.
Not
merely
were
there
love poems and poems
dealing with
nature and human passions, but such prosaic subjects, as
grammar and arithmetic, were done in verse.
During the
last century matters were steadily changing, and
though
verse
is up to the present often
used for subjects that an
English
writer would scarcely
dream of
dealing with
in
anything but prose, yet the main body of Hindi literature,
history,
biography,
fiction,
educational
books,
is now
produced
in
prose, and
verse
is more
largely
reserved
for religious subjects, for erotic writings, for descriptions
of
nature
and
the
reproduction of
episodes
from
the
great
works
in
Sanskrit, such as
the Mahabharat.
In-
cidents
also
from
the
lives of Ram
and
Krishna
are
continually being produced
in various metres.

428
PROSODY.
SECT. 364
Considering the position
that verse took in the
past
of
Hindi literature
and the place which
it
still occupies,
Hindi Grammar would
be very incomplete were Prosody
to find no place in
it.
The subject
is
so wide
that not a
chapter
but a
volume seems
called
for, and
it
may be
hoped that some really good
comprehensive work on the
subject may be produced in English.
All that
can be at-
tempted here
is to give a brief introduction to the subject.
Dr. Kellogg has devoted some 39
pages to
Prosody
in his Hindi Grammar,
This is possibly the best we have
in
English on
the subject.
In
Hindi, Babu Jagannath
Prasad of Bilaspur has written two very important works
dealing
with
Hindi
Prosody,
the
larger
book,
called
^nsmnrr^T, aims
at covering
the whole ground, the
smaller book, ^vSJITVn^T,
treats of metre
or ft(T|^.
The
latter has
proved of
great service to
the writer of
this
Grammar, and he desires
to acknowledge
this, and
to
express
his
high
appreciation
of
the
work.
Babu
Jagannath Prasad
is an enthusiast, and writes with great
ability and judgment.
There are three main divisions for us to consider

It
is
not
easy
to
find
English
words suitable to translate ^g[ and
^l^f.
Emot{o)is and
Styles are probably about the nearest equivalents.
^f{Jcf may
be regarded
as
the emotions
which are
to be expressed.
^^ originally
means
flavour or taste,
the
essence,
or
juice of
anything
which
produces
the
flavour, and
so, as
applied
to
Prosody, stands
for
the
Styles through which the emotions, or VTT^,
'^I'e expressed.
The ^^
is
the appropriate
medium for
reproducing
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
something
like
the
emotions
which have been stirring the mind of the writer.
There
is
a
natural
bent
in
the
Indian
mind
to
elaborate
in
the
way
of
dividing
and
sub-dividing
a
'^^
and
Prosody
is a fine
field for such elaboration.
There are not only *TT^j
but T^*TT^, which apparently
refer to the states of mind which precede the fully-blown
¥TTW
O''
emotions.
There
are
also ^^HT^,
which
indicate the external expression of the emotions.
VfT^ are of two kinds, ^^T^ and ^Tt|<|
or oI|"fiT-

The former, eight in number, by some reckoned
as
nine, refer
to
the
great

is
more
particularly

't

well
therefore to
write of TTTTW^ <^rd and use the word Hyf

The
first point to
consider
is
the exact meaning or
T
use of these two words, ^^ and ^nWT-
C
f
370.
'^T^ or ^^. This word means, literally, letter,
but
in considering Prosody
it must be taken to
signify a
mounded letter, not
a written
one.
It
may
be a
vowel
alone, or
a consonant
with
its
vowel, or a compounded
consonant with
its accompanying vowel.
It
is that
part
of
a word
which
is sounded
at
one movement
of
the
vocal
organs.
This
movement
may commence
with
a
consonant
or not, but must conclude
with a vowel
(with
very
rare
exceptions).
Thus ^
is one ^TJf, so
is j^,
I^U
also
is
but
one
^T^.
The
essential
of
a
^T^
is one vowel sound, whether that vowel be preceded by a
simple or conjunct
consonant,
or
be
alone.
A
vowe!
_ r
there
must
be
in
a ^?U and
ouhf
one.
We may
call
this
a
letter or a
sj/llable,
but
in
neither case
does
it
correspond
with
the
English
letter
or
syllable,
e.g., in
English, son,
is
one
syllable,
in Hindi
it is two, ^ -(- ^.
T
i,e., ^ with
its inherent
jjf
is one ^T^, and

inherent ^

On
the
other
hand,
in
English, so

sea
is
three,
slay
is
four,
sercM, five
;
but the
nearest equivalent sounds to
these
in Hindi, %Tj
^j^ ^%, ^^, are each but one ^l|f.
The ^tj]f
are of two kinds, long and short, depending
on
the
length
of
the
vowel, not
in
any
way
on
the
number of
the consonants.
The long
is called d|V| or
•nK
the short
'^|-c|
or ^f^
In
indicating
these
long
and short q^jj the long
is represented by Jj the
short by
I
It
may be
more convenient
for
us
to keep
to
the
r
English signs —
and —
for
the
long and short ^^\
respectively.
In Hindi, the phrase, ^iTT^ ^T ^Id ^,

would
be
written
down
r

it thus^ — ^

The
principal
exceptions
to
the
above
are
the
following
:—

SECT, 370
METRE.
435
1.
A short syllable, followed by a syllable beginning
with
a
Conjunctive
Consonant,
is reckoned
long,
e.g., in
l||liv^fi, the syllable j^ would be,
ordinarily, short, but
as the following syllable
begins with the Conjunctive,
^l^
this
If is
reckoned long, and
the word would
be repre-
sented by
 ^
i.e., "q-J^,
ft^ =
^f^^
and 7f = ^^.
2.
A short syllable, followed by visarg, or by anusvdr,
when
it
represents
a
strong
nasalization,
is
reckoned
long
(for
this
nasalization, with
its
accompanying consonant,
is practically a con-
junct, consonant).
Thus »Mri"^^T*f|',
if
reck-
oned by vowel sounds, would be
--^ ^ —
,
but, by the above rules, it becomes— ^
-^^
,
because SJJ^ equals
jJT'^cT and
the
Conjunct
7''^ makes the preceding
short vowel ^ equal
to a long syllable. So
^If becomes —
^~-, and
i;'3 - -
.
Anunasik does not affect the length of a syllable or
3.
Sometimes
the
conjunct,
does not
lead
to
the
preceding vowel being reckoned long.
This
is
especially
the case when the
second member

436

SECT. 370
of
the
Conjunct,
is ^ or ^^
cji., Wf{

%Tf% *TtfT T^Rt ^T^, You are

there must be some

the

When
the
matter
is
carefully
worked out,
it
transpires
that
the
differences between the two great classes of Hindi poetry
are
not so
great, nor so
absolute,
as
the
statements of
some writers might
lead
us to
expect.
It must be self-
evident
to
any
one
that
the grouping of
a number
of
lines, either with a certain number of instants or a certain
number of syllables, could not be poetry,
in the
sense
of
metrical poetry.
What
is effected by accent
in
English
verse
is effected in Hindi, viore or
less,

the
arrange-
ment of long and short syllables and the grouping of
the
words into tJ^^,

Dialects
used
in
Poetry.
Even
in English, the
language of
poetry
is
not
quite
identical
with
that
of
prose.
Such words as
morn,
cce,
erst,
ope,
eJiantieleer,
the
flight
of
time,
and
a
thousand
other words
and
phrases, are
felt at once to belong to the realm of
verse
rather
than to
that of
prose.
In Hindi, however, until
comparatively
recently, the
language of
poetry was
far
more
widely
marked
off from
that
obtaining
in
prose
than
it is in English.
It
is not
perhaps so much in the
vocabulary
as
in
the
forms
of
the
words
that
the
differences
are most
marked,
especially in the
forms of
the
Tenses of
the Verbs.
In prose, there has
been the
steady
endeavour to
eliminate dialectical differences, to
" standardise "
the
forms
;
in
poetry, these
dialectical
forms are deliberately, if not always consistently, retained.
Braj bhasha, Avadhi, Eastern Hindi or some other dialect
may be
selected, or forms from
more
than
one
dialect

I

SECt. 377
DIALECTS.
445
may
be
used
in
the same poem.
Braj
is the favourite
dialect, but the large use of
Avadhi by Tulsi Das has led
very many
to
follow
him
in
this
respect
as in many
others.
During recent
years, a school
of
" Khan'
boli "
has
grown up, whose
aim
is
to adopt
in
poetry the forms
commonly
current
in
prose
writing.
Quite
a
large
quantity
of
verse
has
been
produced
on
these
lines.
Naturally, a foreigner
might be expected to
have a pre-
judice in favour of the course advocated by the members
of this new school, making, as
it does, for simplicity, and
lessening
the
difficulties of
understanding the language
of
the poem
; but
it must be
confessed that
there
is
a
sweetness and a
swing in the dialectical
verses that one
does not catch
in the
" Khari boli "
lines.
One of
the
great
advantages of
the dialectical forms
is their pliabi-
lity
in the
hands of
a master
; they may be stretched or
compressed or
twisted
or modified to meet the needs of
the
moment,
remaining recognizable
and
wearing
no
appearance of
grotesqueness or
uncouthness.
For
in-
stance,
in the Ramayan of
Tulsi Das are
found no less
than eleven different forms for the word ^^|

it may be
one syllable ^T^, or two ^%j or three ^^^, according

The c^jcfrl

though, in making this selec-
tion,
it

quite typical of
this division of
poetry.
The
poet who most
excelled in this metre was Pad-
makar
;
Tulsi Das has also used
it very effectively in his
Kabitt Ramayan,
The ^^if^^ contains 31
^IJf in
each
line, arranged
as follows
:— 8-|-8 + 8-f-7 = 31.
If possible, a word should
close at each of the four pauses, but this
is not absolutely
essential.
A word must close, however, at
the 16th and
31st
^fT!{.
This
condition and
the
further one
that
the
last gr^ of
the
line
must
be
long, are
the
only
res-
trictions
placed on
the
full
freedom of
the
poet;
yet
probably
there
is no more
melodious measure
in
Hindi
poetry than the Kabitt.

To
illustrate
the
freedom
of
this form
of
verse,
the
metric
arrangement
of
the
lines
1 and 2
is placed
one over the other, by which
it will be seen how
greatly
they vary.
In
the first example, the
words conclude
at each of
the four pauses,
according
to
the strict rule
;
in the 2nd
it is not so, the tf ^ though belonging to the second group
as regards meaning,
is read with
the first group, so as to
make up the 8 ^IJ. So with the ^^ m the word ^JTW^;

this liberty
is allowed to the poet.
381.
Most of
the Hindi poems which
enjoy the widest
reputation, are written in the styles which conform to the
Matrik method of scanning.
Generally,
a poet
adopts the use of several different
metres in the same poem, something
after the manner of

«ECT. 381.
METRES.
451
Tennyson
in his
" Maud."
Writers vary greatly in
this
matter.
Occasionally,
a
poet
exclusively,
or
almost
exclusively, adopts one special metre,
e.g., Girdhar Kabi-
raya made himself master of the Kundaliya, and uses no
other form of verse
; Bihari Lai's favourite was the Doha
;
Padmakar
excelled in the Kabitt
;
Nilbha Das used the
Chhappaya largely.
Tulsi Das
seemed greatly at home
with all forms of verse
; but possibly the Chaupai was that
in
which he
wrote with
the
greatest
freedom.
In
his
Ramayan,
the
general
method
is
4
chaupais (8 lines),
followed by a Doha, with here and there a Soratha, and,
scattered up and down the book, some Chhands of various
metres.
Some of these latter are very fine.
It has been already noticed that in the MatrikChhand
the
lines
are
regulated
by
the number
of
instants or
r
^I^T, not by
syllables,
"EfT^.
Three points should be noted.
1.
Sometimes
only
the
number
of the
instants
in
the line or Charan
is fixed.
2.
Sometimes
certain
sub-divisions
within
these
Charan
are
fixed, with
the number
of instants
in each
sub-division.
3.
Sometimes the
7[^
in
these
sub-divisions
are
also
fixed,
i.e., the
order
of long and short
syllables
is
definitely
laid
down.
Frequently
this
only
applies
to

452
PROSODY.
SECT. 381
certain parts of the line
:
it may be arranged that a long
syllable must stand
at
the end
of the Charan,
or that
certain
JJTJJ
must
occur in this or that
sub-division
of
the line.
With
reference to 2,
it may very
naturally be asked^
if the line be only measured by
instants, what
difference
can
it make
whether
it
be
said that the Charan must
contain, say, 13 instants, or that
it must have one foot of
6 instants, another one of
4,
and
a third
of
3, making
a total of
13?
The answer
is
that
in
the second
way
of stating
it, a slight restriction
is put upon the arrange-
ment
of long and
short
syllables
;
a foot
must
always
conclude with a completed syllable, and, therefore, under
the
second
method,
there must
not be a
long
syllable
for
the
6th
and
7th
instants in
the
line,
for then the
first half of
the
syllable would
belong to
the 1st
foot,
and
the
second
to
the
2nd, which
is
not
permissible,
e-g.—

same, and the
total number

Of
the numerous species and varieties of
Matrik
Chhand, only a few will be explained and illustrated.
1.
Doha (tf|d|).
The Doha consists of 4 Charans.
The 1st and 3rd Charans contain 3 feet of 6, 4, and 3 ins-
tants, respectively, total 13
; and the 2nd and 4th Charans,
3 feet of
6, 4, and
1
instants, total 11.
The last
foot of
the 1st Charan must be either — w ^ or — —
, but not
—
--
.
The
last
syllable
of
the 2nd and 4th
Charans
must be short.

feet
is different,
being
apparently
4 + 6+1 or 4 + 4 + 3
;
it cannot
be
6 + 4+1,
as
there
is
a
long
syllable
at
6,7.

2.
Soratha
(^Kdl )-
The Soratha
is
a
trans-
posed Doha,
the 1st
and 3rd Charans of
the latter be-
coming the 2nd and 4th of the Soratha, and the 2nd and
4th
the
1st
and
3rd.
Thus,
instead
of 6 + 4 + 3 =13,
6+ 4+1
—11, we get 11 instants in the
1st Charan and
13 in
the 2nd, and
the rhyme also comes
in the middle
of the half-verse instead of the end.

Chaupai. ^'im^,
i.e., four-footed. A Chaupai
is made
up
of
4
Charans, each
Charan
containing
16-
instants.
The 2nd Charan rhymes
with the
1st, and the
4th with
the 3rd.
The
last two instants
must
be — or
^-^
-
, that
is to
say, a long syllable must not precede a
final —'
.
As
regards the
earlier
14
instants
of
each
Charan,
various arrangements are
possible and permis-
sible.
For
the
whole
Charan
perhaps,
the most
general
arrangement
is
6-f 4 + 4 + 2 =16.
Other arrangements
are
also
given.
The
following
are

as an

of an

Chaupai.
Wherefore I, having bowed viy head
before
the saints,
will sing the glory of Hari, the giver of peace to his
people, the sportive life he lived in Brij, of this will
I tell something xvith joy.
It will be noticed
that
the 3rd Charan
of the above
does
not
scan
correctly;
it
is 6 + 5 + 3 + 2,
instead
of
6+ 4 + 4 + 2
; but
there
is
no
difficulty
in
reading
it,
because |ch^, though correcly -- —
, reads more like— -^,
the T seems to lengthen
the previous J^ nearly into ^j^
and
the SJn* lifter ^ does
not get
its
full
length,
and

This example well illustrates
how a poet is not a slave to rules, but trusts his ear.

Kundaliya (^TJ^M^ {).
This
is
not an un-
common
verse, and
is a
good
illustration of
the pecu-
liarities which some writers delight in.

SECT. 385

457
Its peculiarity consists
in
this, that
the first Charan
of
the third line must be the same as the second Charan
of
the second
line, and
the whole verse must close with
the same words as
it commences with.
The Kundaliya consists of 6 lines. The first two are a
doha, the
last
four a ^^TT. This ^T^T has
four
lines,

24 M[^[

him,
Paltu

others 200

Kundaliyas
have
been
collected
and
published.
He
appears to have invented a Kundaliya of
his own.
Each
verse contains
nine lines, the
first and
last
are
identical, and
the
last
half
of
the 1st
line
is
repeated as the first half of the 2nd.
This
is but a brief introduction to a very large subject.
Not
only
are
there
a very
great
number of
different
verses, but
frequently numerous
varieties of one form of
verse,

writer
speaks of

BRAJ BHASHA.
386.
For the study of the Braj Bhasha, few prose works
are available. About the best is the <i>3iTf)iH
of Lallu Ji.
In modern editions
of
this, however,
the tendency
is to
substitute
modern
Hindi forms
for the more
distinctly
Braj forms.
Probably the best edition obtainable
is that
published
by
the
(Government)
Board
of
Examiners,
Council
House
Street, Calcutta.
Rs.
3.
It
has
useful
notes.
Sometimes, even by
Indian
readers, the Prem Sagar
(also
by
Lallu Ji)
is spoken of as
written
in
the
Braj
Bhasha
;
but
this
is
not
the case.
It was put
into the
Hindi
prose that was then
being developed by
Lallu Ji
from a Braj original.
The Braj forms are largely confined
to
the
scraps
of
verse with
which
the
prose
is
inter-
spersed. Commentators on the Ramayan and other Hindi
books not uncommonly aifect a style which approximates.
in
a larger
or less
degree, to
the Braj
dialect, but the
true
domain of
Braj Bhasha
is poetry.
Hindi
writers
may adhere to modern Hindi in their prose
; but, as soon
as
they
use
verse, Braj
is
the
dialect most
frequently

^60
BRAJ BHASHA,
SECT. 386
brought into requisition.
It is therefore necessary for the
student at an early stage of his reading
to acquire some
familiarity
with the
more common
forms of
the
Braj
declensions and conjugations.
As
Braj
forms
predominate
largely
in most
Hindi
works written in verse,
it is needless to refer to many by
name.
The ^^f^^T^,
by
Brajbasi
Das,
would,
I
believe, be accepted as a good specimen.
An exceedingly
useful book is the
'' Sabha
Bilas."
Of this a good edition
was
published
at
the
Medical
Hall
Press, Benares, in
1900
;
it has an
English
translation and
full notes.
A
most
helpful
book
for a
student.
(The
price
is about
Rs.
6,
I believe).
In
the
following
lists, no
pretence
is made
to com-
pleteness,
and not
every form
given
is
to
be
taken as
necessarily
pure
Braj.
The
charge of
slavish
purism
cannot
be fairly
brought against the
majority of
Hindi
writers.
Tulsi Das
wrote
in
Purabi
Hindi,
but
was
quite ready
to use
forms from other
dialects,
and,
in
<:ase of need, to
make up new forms of
his own.
The
glamour of
Tulsi Das'
style has
so
influenced
poetry
«ince
his
time,
that
few
writers
adhere
strictly
and
exclusively
to
Braj
forms,
but
introduce
Purabi
and
other dialectic forms
;
probably few
could decide
which
are Braj forms and which belong
to some
other dialect.

In these
circumstances,
it
has been thought
better
to
give some of the more common forms met with in poetry ,^
whether these forms be Braj or not.

in a
