ABSTRACT 
 
 Yudanika, Festri. (2017). The Acquisition of Highly Intelligible English 
Pronunciation by Five Indonesian Speakers: A Collective Case Study. 
Yogyakarta: English Language Study, Graduate Program, Sanata Dharma 
University. 
Pronunciation is the heart of oral communication. Poor pronunciation has 
been a legendary grave problem in speaking which leads to misunderstanding 
and misinterpretation. Non-native speaker with highly intelligible English 
pronunciation is scarce to find and only few could actually acquire it. Highly 
intelligible English pronunciation is not the parameter of best performance of 
English pronunciation but this appreciated ability turns out to be influential for 
speaking ability. Since improving one’s English pronunciation is necessary to 
escape from being stigmatized by foreign accent (Alip, 2007), it is important to 
know how the acquirers achieve this ability, what constraints they confront, and 
how they cope. Hence, the aim of this study is to discover the factors of how 
non-native speakers from Indonesia acquire highly intelligible English 
pronunciation.  
This study is a collective case study in nature. For data gathering, the 
five participants were to complete recorded reading aloud, pronunciation test 
and also had an interview to accommodate context scrutiny. The study employed 
both journalistic and statistical analysis. Triangulation was also exerted by 
having inter-rater reliability from British and American native speakers as well 
as by consulting to a fluent speaker of English who learns phonology. Pearson’s 
Coefficient of Correlation (r) was also incorporated to accommodate inter-rater 
reliability. 
The result shows that the value of r = 0.67 and both raters have a strong 
positive correlation in ensuring that all participants are indeed highly intelligible. 
The phonology expert’s score also shows that all participants possess good 
mastery of English pronunciation. As for the cross-cases context scrutiny, it 
probes similar factors enhancing the acquisition of this achievement from the 
interview. They are age, L2, personality, motivation, exposure, environment, 
joining English championship, and being perceived to be accented.  
This study argues that those similar factors discovered from various 
contexts are the cornerstones of the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation. In brief, the study of the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation is not only an archive but also an anchor for people to achieve this 
ability. The findings imply that this ability is possible to achieve by any non-
native speakers who are set to be situated in the preceding factors and it is also 
applicable for the acquisition of other foreign languages. Henceforth, further 
research in this area is worth conducting.

Pelafalan adalah jantung dari komunikasi lisan. Pelafalan yang buruk 
telah menjadi problematika fatal yang melegenda dan mengarah pada 
kesalahpahaman serta salah pengartian. Penutur non-asli dengan pelafalan 
Bahasa Inggris yang sangat berterima sangat jarang ditemukan dan hanya sedikit 
yang bisa menguasainya. Pelafalan Bahasa Inggris yang sangat berterima 
bukanlah tolak ukur dari pelafalan Bahasa Inggris yang terbaik tetapi 
kemampuan yang layak diapresiasi ini ternyata berpengaruh terhadap 
kemampuan berbicara dalam bahasa tersebut. Karena meningkatkan pelafalan 
Bahasa Inggris untuk bebas dari stigma yang buruk adalah perlu (Alip, 2007) 
maka sangat penting untuk mengetahui bagaimana para peraihnya mendapatkan 
kemampuan ini, kendala apa saja yang mereka hadapi dan bagaimana mereka 
mengatasinya. Oleh karena itu, tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk menemukan 
faktor-faktor dalam proses memperoleh pelafalan Bahasa Inggris yang sangat 
berterima oleh penutur asli Bahasa Indonesia.  
Penelitian ini adalah studi kasus kolektif. Untuk pengumpulan data, 
kelima peserta diminta melakukan membaca keras direkam, tes pelafalan, dan 
juga menjalani wawancara untuk keperluan penyelidikan konteks. Penelitian ini 
menggunakan analisa jurnalistik dan statistik. Triangulasi dilakukan dengan 
menggunakan reliabilitas inter-rater dari penutur asli Bahasa Inggris asal Inggris 
dan Amerika dan juga berkonsultasi dengan penutur ahli Bahasa Inggris yang 
mempelajari fonologi. Korelasi Koefisien Pearson (r) digunakan untuk 
mengolah korelasi dari penilaian kedua penutur asli. 
Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa nilai r = 0.67. Nilai tersebut 
membuktikan bahwa kedua penutur asli sangat sepakat dan mengakui bahwa 
kelima peserta memang memiliki pelafalan Bahasa Inggris yang sangat 
berterima. Skor dari ahli fonologi juga menunjukkan bahwa seluruh peserta 
memiliki penguasaan pelafalan Bahasa Inggris yang bagus. Penyelidikan lintas 
kasus yang diperoleh dari wawancara telah menunjukkan beberapa faktor yang 
sama dan memiliki andil dalam proses pemerolehan kemampuan ini. Faktor-
faktor itu adalah umur, bahasa kedua, kepribadian, motivasi, paparan, 
lingkungan, mengikuti kompetisi Bahasa Inggris dan diakui beraksen. 
Penelitian ini menyajikan pendapat bahwa kesamaan faktor yang 
ditemukan dalam penyelidikan lintas kasus dari konteks yang beragam adalah 
pemegang andil yang penting dalam pemerolehan pelafalan Bahasa Inggris yang 
sangat berterima. Secara singkat, penelitian ini bukan hanya menambah arsip 
tetapi juga sebagai dukungan bagi mereka yang ingin memperoleh kemampuan

tersebut. Hasil penelitian mengimplikasikan bahwa kemampuan ini sangat mungkin 
diraih oleh siapapun penutur non-asli yang dikondisikan untuk berada dalam situasi yang 
sesuai dengan faktor-faktor yang telah disebutkan. Hal tersebut dapat pula diterapkan 
pada bahasa asing yang lain. Oleh karena itu, penelitian lebih lanjut di area ini sangat 
layak dilakukan.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
  
This chapter provides the overview of the justification of this study. It 
comprises the background of the study, the problem identification, the limitation 
of the problem, the formulation of the problem, research aim and also research 
benefits. In those subsections, substantial information regarding the cognizance 
of the essence of studying the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation is also clarified. 
A. Background 
Pronunciation is the heart of oral communication. It is the master of 
meaning creation in the realm of spoken language. A remark by Thornbury 
(2005:24) regarding of the knowledge of language learners, also states that 
phonology is the one giving color to the mastery of speaking. Brown (2001: 
270-271) also states that it is the most salient characteristic possessed by the oral 
communication and covers three essential sub characteristics such as stress, 
intonation and rhythm in terms of the contribution of message delivery. 
Strengthening the latter statement, Giegerich (1992:250-251) proposes that the 
way a speaker utters words in different stress, whether it is in the initial or in the 
final syllable, could create different meaning. It could be scrutinized in the 
pronunciation of black bird /blæk. ˈbɜːd/ and blackbird /ˈblæk.bɜːd/. The 
pronunciation of the word „black bird‟ /blæk.ˈbɜːd/ with stress in the final 
syllable of the noun phrase is to represent a bird which is black. While blackbird 
/ˈblæk.bɜːd/ with stress in the initial of the compound noun, it is to represent a 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

2 
 
 
 
 
particular species of bird. It is never debatable that each component of this 
productive microskill is influential in meaning creation and the effect of its 
incorrect production is grave. 
A good and correct pronunciation of a spoken language leads into an 
effective association of meaning which enables the speaker and the audience to 
share the same understanding (Gilakjani, 2012: 120). It is a universal truth that 
the success of meaning negotiation is the one sustaining a good communication. 
A poor pronunciation, on the other hand, will surely cause communication 
failure. Such matter works in any language, whether it is in the acquisition of 
mother tongue or new languages. 
The impacts of failure in mastering good pronunciation could be serious. 
Benrabah-Denjane (2009) identifies several problems caused by the failure of 
acquiring good pronunciation experienced by French learners of English related 
to the pronunciation of voiceless glottal fricative /h/. This sound does not exist 
in French and when they incorrectly pronounce that particular sound, some 
problems like mistakes and even errors in the structure such as the use of 
articles, distinguishing pronoun and auxiliaries, differentiating minimal pairs 
and eventually lexical versus grammatical ambiguity start to emerge.  
As for another impact regarding the failure, Saito (2011) identifies eight 
English-specific segmentals, /æ, f, v, θ, ð, w, l, ɹ/, which are difficult for native 
Japanese to acquire and to learn. The learners tend to remember the L2 words in 
written language. Such phenomenon happens because the Japanese‟ daily oral 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

communication scarcely use those particular segmental. That is quite a problem. 
As Thornburry (2005:24) also says, a word is stored along with its pronunciation 
and needs no reconstitution each time it is used. It means that the improvement 
of pronunciation deals with more practice to obtain unconscious mastery. The 
less the learners‟ eagerness, the slower their pronunciation acquisition will be. 
Not to mention that the learners associate the sounds of the second language 
words with their mother tongue which eventually build a barrier instead. 
Attempts to improve the L2 pronunciation of L2 learners, even to achieve 
highly intelligible pronunciation, have been made in years and continuum. As 
poor pronunciation has always been one of the biggest problems in speaking 
which leads to misunderstanding and misinterpretation, the eagerness of making 
such attempts is aimed to facilitate the success of meaning negotiation in the oral 
communication using L2. The results are mostly far from what is expected as L2 
learners have to fight tooth and nail to produce particular segmentals or 
suprasegmentals features of English pronunciation. That makes only few could 
ever master the highly appreciated intelligibility of L2 pronunciation. Fledge & 
Fletcher (1992); Fledge, Munro, & MacKay (1995); Young-Scholten (1995); 
Hill (1970)) are some of the researchers who strongly believe that the success of 
L2 phonology attainment is scarce. However, there is still a glimpse of hope 
regarding the way to improve the pronunciation by having individual practice 
like how Hill proposes (1970). 
Poor pronunciation could arise from many factors. In second language 
acquisition, it could be triggered by the interference of L1. In their effort to 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

4 
 
 
 
master the speaking ability, pronunciation has become the lowest level of 
information that second language learners know. Good pronunciation is surely 
what L2 learners expect the most to acquire. Foreign accent is normal for L2 
speech performance (Piske et al., 2001) and the L2 itself has to be assessed in 
two different perspectives; accented and comprehensibility Derwing and Munro 
(2005: 385). Between the two, comprehensibility is the one highlighted in the 
form of communication.  
The notion of comprehensibility here deals with the intelligibility of 
language performance (Burns, 2003). In the context of this study, the ability of 
L2 speakers in performing L2 pronunciation which is clear enough to be 
understood is the one being highlighted. English non-native speakers are 
common to possess poor English pronunciation. Nevertheless, the other 
particular non-native speakers are also in the possession of highly intelligible 
pronunciation.  
The acknowledgement of the natives to the non-natives‟ L2 is also 
influenced by the intelligibility of the pronunciation. It deals with intelligence, 
prestige, professional competence, persuasiveness, diligence and social privilege 
(Gelvanovsky, 2002). One‟s cognizance toward the nature of L2 pronunciation, 
the features and the technique of the mastery is also essential in providing the 
evidence that one can perform intelligible pronunciation. The fact that many 
world-class singers and other public figures that are not from English speaking 
countries and find English as their L2 or even foreign language are able to be 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

5 
 
 
 
accepted internationally is also one example of the influence of highly 
intelligible pronunciation. 
So, what is highly intelligible pronunciation? What is it like? Is it native-
like? The raters in this study who are native American and British agree that 
highly intelligible pronunciation is the one which needs no confirmation once it 
is heard. Intelligible pronunciation could be identified when the listeners still try 
to confirm whether the speaker‟s meaning is in line with what they understand. 
Meanwhile, highly intelligible pronunciation is identified when the listeners 
could digest or interpret the meaning correctly in no time. They grasp the 
meaning which is exactly intended by the speakers.   
Highly intelligible pronunciation does not deal with any similarity to 
specific English accent. Meaning, the speakers of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation do not have to be exactly native-like. With previous remarks, is 
highly intelligible pronunciation considered prime? For the sake of successful 
meaning negotiation, surely it is. 
The biggest query is then whether the existence of highly intelligible 
second language pronunciation is a miracle or an achievement. If it is an 
achievement, what is needed to acquire it? These questions deal a lot with the 
need to find the factors influencing the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation. Commonly, EFL learners find it difficult to acquire good and 
natural English pronunciation. However, despite the common sense that the 
mastery of highly intelligible L2 pronunciation is scarce to find, the L2 speakers 
who possess highly intelligible second language pronunciation do become the

best interest for a particular number of researchers such as Fledge & Fletcher 
(1992); Fledge, Munro, & MacKay (1995); Young-Scholten (1995); Hill (1970).  
In most of the studies related to the acquisition of second language 
pronunciation, the most salient factors to affect the acquisition of highly 
intelligible English pronunciation for Indonesian are still scarce to find. The 
work of this research contributes to that field. This study is also carried out 
inasmuch as the finding related to the ways of acquiring such achievement 
which are depicted in the cases of the participants of this research could possibly 
be used for language learners. 
B. Problem Identification 
In this study, there are many problems encountered regarding the nature 
of the language and the participants. They could exist probably before, during 
and after the performance of the research. Tanner (2012) identified the problems 
dealing with the factors influencing the acquisition of L2 pronunciation. They 
could be scrutinized as the following. 
The problems in this research come from external and internal factors at 
large. They include the diverse context of the participants backgrounds (internal 
factors) such as their need,  motivation, implementation, occupation, the 
participant interests  and so on. The problems also include the external factors 
such as the influence of diverse mother tongues, the community being engaged 
with, the level of instruction (knowledge obtained from formal education), and 
the diverse sources of exposure.

The problems encountered could be prolific since pronunciation is one of 
the tangible evidence of oral performance. It is a product of how the mind 
incorporates with the speech organ in order to produce sound.  One could hear 
particular L2 pronunciation very well, could identify the distinction of phonemes 
very well but could not perform such sound exactly.  
C. Problem Limitation 
It has been figured out that the scope of the study is absolutely broad and 
replete of distinct areas. Prolific problems regarding the difficulties to perform 
intelligible English pronunciation could emerge in relation to the topic of 
pronunciation and acquisition. Thus, this study discusses about several points 
dealing with the acquisition of English pronunciation of those highly intelligible 
speakers. As for the main scope of the discussion of this study, it scrutinizes the 
matter regarding the factors of the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation. 
D. Problem Formulation  
  
The main wonder triggering the study is the following problem 
formulation. 
What are the most common factors enhancing the acquisition of highly 
intelligible English pronunciation in the cases of the five participants? 
E. Research Goal 
In this study, the main aim is to find the most common factors relevant in 
influencing the acquisition of highly intelligible English pronunciation. Those 
factors could be archived as the reference of how highly intelligible English 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

8 
 
 
 
pronunciation is achieved by non-natives. They could also be used as the trigger 
for the scientist to create techniques in improving English pronunciation. The 
scrutiny of the other factors is also to be described. The description itself is one 
of the scientific truths to figure out in this case study. 
F. Research Benefits 
In general, this study will deliberately provide some contributions toward 
the readers who concern with this matter. It is also profitable for academic 
purpose. Since the discussion and the finding of the case study comprise the 
information of how different processes of highly intelligible speakers acquire 
their L2 pronunciation, those who are cognizant and fond of phonology, 
psycholinguistic, and language acquisition could find it interesting.  
There are two kinds of benefits which this study offers. The nature of the 
benefits is scientifically and practically. In particular, this research will be 
profitable scientifically to these following fields. 
a. Teaching Technique Improvement 
As pronunciation is the heart of oral communication, the teaching of 
pronunciation is important. It has to be monitored, developed and improved. 
The finding of this case study which covers some information regarding level 
of instruction will perhaps be useful for any educator of language.  
b. Consideration For Writing Journal Articles 
The findings of this study could be one of the considerations for those 
who are fond of writing articles about pronunciation, L2 acquisition, especially 
the one concerning with phonology. The findings of this study would enrich 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

9 
 
 
 
their cognizance toward this matter. It is a trigger for them to write more 
inspiring articles. 
The latter are the scientific profit offered by this study. Other than those, 
this research will also be profitable practically.  These following fields would 
likely be positively benefited out of it. 
c. English Department Students 
The finding of this research will also enrich the knowledge of the 
acquisition of pronunciation to the students of English department. The 
students are expected to be more cognizant toward the two aspects of 
pronunciation, that is, segmental and suprasegmental aspects. They are also 
expected to take example from the participants‟ toil which are depicted in the 
cases context scrutiny.  
d.  L2 Learners 
L2 learners who are mostly from EFL and ESL countries will find the 
findings interesting. The result of the sharing and the analysis dealing with 
pronunciation will help them to be more aware of their own pronunciation and 
give them a glimpse of a path to improve their own pronunciation. By having 
such awareness and cognizance, the learners of L2 could get better 
pronunciation mastery. 
e. Future researchers 
The findings of the research can be an anchor for those who want to 
conduct researches in similar topic. As an archive, the findings of this research 
could be used as a torch for the next researcher to dig other particular areas more 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

10 
 
 
 
profoundly. Perhaps, the future researcher could take the findings as one of the 
considerations to create strategies in achieving highly intelligible English 
pronunciation. 
f. Parenting  
The finding of this study will be useful for a parent who concerns on 
the development of her child‟s language mastery. The one who wishes her 
lineage to master more than one language and perform them just the way 
natives do will probably find this case study useful. The parents who find it as 
the best interest could set a good way to facilitate the child‟s language 
acquisition based on the knowledge shared by the participants.

CHAPTER II 
REVIEW OF RELATED THEORIES 
This chapter comprises the theories and relevant studies related to the 
notion of the acquisition of highly intelligible second language pronunciation. 
All of the information provided in the following clarification is the base of this 
study. As for the clarification, it is mainly about the theoretical review of 
language transfer, the acquisition of L2 phonology, pronunciation, the notion 
of being native and intelligibility, phonemic awareness, and the theoretical 
framework of this study. 
A. 
Theoretical Review 
The theoretical review discusses about the acquisition of second 
language phonology by adult learners. It also discusses the notion of being 
native and intelligible principles in second language pronunciation. Related 
studies of this research are also discussed in the following clarification. 
1. The Acquisition of Second Language Phonology by Adult Learners 
The discussion of the acquisition of second language phonology itself 
comprises the acquisition and the theories of language transfer. By scrutinizing 
this notion, it is easier to comprehend the nature of how highly L2 pronunciation 
is transferred, which phases are actually the same as L1 acquisition, and what 
become its constraints. It also clarifies the features of pronunciation, the factors 
and the essence of pronunciation. This clarification is essential for the sake of 
having better understanding of how highly intelligible pronunciation is acquired 
by ESL and EFL learner. 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

12 
 
 
 
a. The Acquisition of Phonology   
The second language transfer is indeed influential to every aspect such as 
morphology, graphology, syntaxis, and phonology. Ellis (2008) proposes that 
phonology is the first to acquire. Fromkin (2003) also states that the 
identification of sounds comes first in the process of early language 
acquisition. 
 The acquisition of phonology itself starts in the early childhood of 
human when a baby firstly recognizes and makes the sounds which occur 
frequently in the world‟s language such as [b,m,d,k] and so forth (Fromkin et 
al, 2003). The general order of phonology acquisition is based on the manner 
of articulation starting from nasal, glides, stops, liquids, fricatives, and 
affricate.  Thus, it is no wonder that baby‟s first word is mama.  
From the latter clarification, it makes sense for the learners of English as 
second and foreign language to find it not easy in imitating or even sounding 
some fricatives and affricate phonemes. It is in line with most common 
pronunciation committed by Indonesian speakers who learn English. The 
tendency to sound some fricatives [f,v, θ, ð, ʒ, ʃ ] and affricate [ʧ, ʤ] 
incorrectly is quite tense for Indonesian speakers. 
Acquiring the phonology of L2 is a meticulous scrutiny (Ellis, 2008). 
There are many reasons like sound absences or the issue of different manner of 
articulation. Stress and intonation which give color to distinguish different 
accent are also possible to become a barrier. The interference from L1 is also a 
stark influence of pronunciation issue. 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

13 
 
 
 
 In the realm of second language acquisition, phonology is also one 
salient aspect which study is broad. Gass and Selinker (2001) propose that the 
knowledge of sound system of a native language is complex. At  the very least, 
a native speaker is to be cognizant not only in terms of identifying what are 
possible and what are not possible sounds in the native language but also what 
are possible combinations of sounds as well as what sounds are found in what 
parts of words. Such knowledge also comprises the cognizance of connected 
speech, strong and weak forms, what meaning is entailed in particular 
pronunciation, etc. 
As for the identification of problems in the acquisition of phonology, it 
happens mostly in the transfer. Jenkins (2000) states, even though transfer is 
the one enabling oneself to identify the difficulties in performing L2 
pronunciation, the developmental process is the one providing oneself a 
solution to resolve the problems. Hence, in this stage, one‟s consciousness of 
the difference of L1 and L2 emerges as well as the effort to overcome. 
b. The Theories of Language Transfer 
The idea of language transfer is that L1 is inseparable factor for L2 
acquisition (Ellis, 2008). The problem is acute because „learners sometimes 
transfer in want of a better solution even though they consider a given concept 
„non-transferable‟ (Kasper, 1984). That is the reason why the L2 learner speaks 
what is called „interlanguage‟. Selinker and other researchers (Corder, 1981; 
Mitchell and Myles, 2004; Nemser, 1971; Williams and Burden, 1997) in Luna 
(2010) propose the term of interlanguage to define an intermediate stage 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

14 
 
 
 
between learners‟ L1 and L2 where they apply the linguistic systems of both 
languages to produce L2 itself. Interlanguage indicates the language learning 
stages, becomes the transitory and the change of L2 users‟ linguistic state, and 
is influenced by individual cognitive and skills and contextual pushing factors. 
Distinct from the latter, the early childhood acquisition of a second 
language pronunciation is found to have fewer constraints than those who learn 
the second language in their adolescence or adult time. Such matter is 
explained by different perspectives. The following are some perspectives 
regarding of the latter. 
Table 2.1: The Theories of Language Transfer 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are many challenges to each of the concepts. However, the factors 
proposed indeed contribute to the L2 acquisition. Related to pronunciation, the 
problems and the barrier existing in the transfer from L1 to L2 obviously could 
be scrutinized. 
c. The Features of English Pronunciation 
Brown (2001) states microskills in oral communication are indeed 
essential. Rebbeca (2011) in her learning video posted by www.engVid.com 
says that “pronunciation does matter”. She believes, when people say that 
No.

pronunciation does matter, what people have to do is speaking correctly and 
clearly. Thus, more practice makes perfect. Mastering spoken language needs 
not only study but also practice in the same time (Lynn Lundquist, 2012). It is 
important to retrain frequently our tongue as well as our mind, hearing and 
memory in the same time so that the skill is obtained more quickly.  
Suwarsih Madya (2000) states both the mother tongue and L2 have the 
same places of articulations but have different manners. This is what made the 
L2 learners lacking in pronunciation. Fromkin (2003) also states that 
pronunciation deals not only with sound but also intonation and stress which 
give color the special characteristics to each language in the world. Thus, 
learning pronunciation needs a lot of practices and self-study. 
 The following scheme is the features of pronunciation which L2 learners 
are supposed to be aware of (Gilakjani, 2012). The features are divided in two 
main parts namely segmental and suprasegmental. These two are the salient 
parts of pronunciation which serve just like vein and artery to heart. One with a 
wish of having native-like pronunciation has to combine the competence in 
performing the two aspects

Figure 2.1: The scheme of English Pronunciation Features (Gilakjani, 2012 pp. 
120) 
 
Seferoglu (2005) clarifies that segmental aspect deals with the sound 
system such as vowels and consonants. It comprises the realm of individual 
sound of phonemes. It is also known as the microskills of pronunciation. The 
following figure is the segmental sounds which are included as consonants.

Figure 2.2: The Segmental Sounds (consonants) 
 
The segmental aspect also covers the vowel and diphthongs. It deals with 
the how the airstream goes from lung to oral cavity without any block from 
particular speech organ. The shape of the mouth determines the generation of 
the sounds. The vowels are classified also out of the position and the roundness 
of mouth. It could be scrutinized in the following figure.  
 
 
 
Figure 2.3: The Segmental Sounds (vowels) 
 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

18 
 
 
 
Unlike segmental aspects, suprasegmental is the study of phonological 
features which apply to groups larger than the single segment, such as the 
syllable or the word. Suprasegmental aspects, referring to Coniam (2002), 
deals with broader factors which shape the uniqueness of pronunciation and 
goes beyond the sound system matter (prosody). Its features include variation 
in stress and pitch (Ladefoged, 1993). Suprasegmental also called Prosodic 
feature, in phonetics, a speech feature such as stress, tone, or word juncture that 
accompanies or is added over consonants and vowels; these features are not 
limited to single sounds but often extend over syllables, words, or phrases. It is 
then called the macroskills of pronunciation. Burns (2003) strengthens by 
stating that supragemental‟s features such as intonation, linking and stress 
make the pronunciation much more effective even appears to be native-like. 
d. The Factors Affecting Pronunciation 
 Some studies have been conducted to find out the lineup of factors 
which influence the acquisition of pronunciation. Many case studies were done 
to portray distinct description of how particular people acquired their 
intelligible L2 pronunciation. Ellis (2008) proposes several aspects related to 
individual differences which influence the second language learning. In this 
case, the learning of second language pronunciation is also determined by those 
factors. The aspects to considers are intelligence, working memory, language 
aptitude, learning styles, personality (extraverted, ambiverted, or introverted), 
motivation (integrative, instrumental), anxiety, willingness to communicate, 
learner‟s belief and learning strategy. 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

19 
 
 
 
Another perspective, Tanner (2012) proposes three factors influencing 
such matter. The finding comprises culture, motivation and level of instruction. 
Tanner  believes that one‟s pronunciation is much affected by the way his or 
her surrounding live their life, the one‟s inner drive either instrumental or 
interpersonal which triggers him/her to pay deep concern on pronunciation and 
the instructional language learning from school.   
e. The Essence of Pronunciation 
Pronunciation is the heart of oral communication. It is a universal 
agreement that the knowledge of pronunciation determines the quality of one‟s 
speaking performance as well as the success of meaning negotiation in oral 
communication. Thornbury (2005), regarding of the knowledge of language 
learners, states that phonology is the one giving color to the mastery of 
speaking. Pronunciation and speaking mastery is then inseparable.  
There is a lot of research which findings show how important 
pronunciation is.  Brown (2001) states that a good speaking with the 
consideration of microskills is shown by the production of English stress and 
distress patterns of the words, tone, rhythmic structure, intonational contours, 
fluency, accuracy, the use of cohesive devices and so on. Not only speaking, 
vocabulary enrichment or the process of gaining better mastery in 
understanding and storing L2 words also walks hand in hand with the 
acquisition of pronunciation. A word is stored along with its pronunciation and 
needs no reconstitution each time it is used (Thornburry, 2005). 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

20 
 
 
 
The lack of pronunciation could be devastating in terms of language 
performance. Gilakjani (2012) states that limited pronunciation may decrease 
one‟s self-confidence, restrict social interactions, and triggers negative 
perception which leads to doubtfulness toward one‟s credibility and ability. On 
the other hand, Zielinski (2012) states that those with negative perception about 
their own L2 pronunciation will avoid to do oral communication due to the 
embarrassment and worry whether their pronunciation is correct or incorrect. It 
definitely demoralizes one‟s motivation to perform speaking ability. Derwing 
and Rossiter (2002) state that the majority of participants in their research 
found pronunciation difficulties contributed to barriers of communicating in 
English. 
f. How to Test Pronunciation 
 Vaughan (2002) identifies some aspects comprised in pronunciation. 
From the clarification, the pronunciation test is to comprise all of those 
mentioned aspects. As for the whole aspects, they could be scrutinized in the 
following: 
a. 
The cognizance of vowel and consonants 
b. 
The cognizance of phoneme (the individual sound of vowels and 
consonants) 
c. 
The cognizance of phonemic transcript (the symbol which stands for a 
single phoneme) 
d. 
The cognizance of word stress (the primary/secondary stress and the 
weak form) 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

21 
 
 
 
e. 
The cognizance of schwa which is the names of the shortest (most 
common) spoken vowel found in English. 
f. 
The cognizance of pitch (the move up-down of voice), tone groups and 
tonic syllables   
g. 
The cognizance of intonation (rise and fall) 
h. 
The cognizance of highlighting particular words 
As for the instruments of the pronunciation test, it can be seen in the 
following figure. 
 
Figure 2.4: The Instruments of Pronunciation Test (Vaughan-Rees, 2002) 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

22 
 
 
 
The one proposed by Vaughan (2002) is in line with the one Brown 
(2001) proposed regarding the microskills of oral communication. The most 
salient characteristic possessed by the oral communication covers three 
essential sub characteristics such as stress, intonation and rhythm in terms of 
the contribution of message delivery. Those are the components of 
pronunciation. 
2. The Notion of Being Native-Like and Intelligible Principles in Second 
Language Pronunciation 
The discussion of this section covers the clarification of definition, the 
acquisition of native-like English pronunciation, the criteria of native-like 
pronunciation, the clarification that native-like pronunciation is crucial, 
intelligibility principles, the criteria of intelligible second language 
pronunciation, and  how to rate intelligibility.  
a. Definition 
The nature of intelligibility in second language performance is indeed 
varied. In oral communication, it is shown not only by the pronunciation but 
even also by the use of formulaic expression which indicates the parameter of 
one‟s model and community. Ortac¸tepe (2013) employed native speaker raters 
to judge that formulaic expression could enhance L2 learners‟ native likeness. 
The raters did not get any specific criteria. The judgment based on “it just does 
not sound right”. It means, it basically relied on the native speakers‟ 
identification.  
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

23 
 
 
 
In previous studies, the notion of native-likeness is determined by several 
perspectives. It also depends on several interpretations. Here are some 
clarifications of the notion of being native-like found in several studies. 
a. 
To self-identify as the native like speaker of the target  language (Piller, 
2002; Seliger, 1978; Seliger et. al. 1975) 
b. 
To be perceived as a native-like speaker by native speakers of the target 
language (Bongaerts, 1999; Moyer, 1999; Neufeld, 2001) 
c. 
To be a native-like speaker of target language (Birdsong, 1999; Bley-
Vorman, 1989; Long, 1990) 
Such fact goes the same for native-likeness in pronunciation. The notion 
of native-like second language pronunciation is also considered problematic 
inasmuch as various definitions are proposed. Dokovova (2016) has simplified 
the concept of native-like based on her own case. In her attempt of achieving 
„native-like‟ pronunciation, she recorded her own voice and analyze the sounds 
produced, determining which sounds are influenced by her dominant languages 
and which sounds are diverged from the native‟s sound production. That area 
of divergence is the one she tries to assimilate.  
Meanwhile, Szyszka (2015) has proposed another term for this matter. 
Instead of using the term English „native-like‟, the study uses the term „good 
English pronunciation users‟. When it is interpreted out of its phrase, native 
means relating to or describing someone's country or place of birth or someone 
who was born in a particular country or place. Native-like second language 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

24 
 
 
 
pronunciation is then the pronunciation performed by non-native speaker 
which sounds similar to that of the native‟s. 
The previous examples are the attempts of people to understand what 
native-like is and to exert the mastery so that they could have one. This is the 
very evidence that native-like pronunciation is not only interesting but also 
wanted. Even so, is it truly possible for oneself to acquire such dreamy ability? 
Thus, it is necessary to comprehend more about the remarks of how native-like 
pronunciation is acquired and the possibilities of acquiring it. 
b. The Acquisition of Native-like English Pronunciation 
Some studies show that the acquisition of native-like pronunciation is 
affected by several factors which are classified in two broad scopes, internal 
and external factors. External factors deal with the causes which come from the 
environment or outside while internal factors come from the learner‟s personal 
matter. Tanner (2012) has proposed that the factors influencing pronunciation 
are culture, motivation and the level of instruction. The influence of culture and 
motivation are understudied and yet widely explored. However, there are some 
findings showing that the acquisition of pronunciation could be caused by level 
(Face, 2006; Rose, 2010).  
a. 
Internal Factors 
Internal factors are the ones in which the language acquirer is personally 
equipped. In this study, there are seven internal factors which are considered to 
be influential. Those factors are age, ear perception, aptitude, motivation, 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

25 
 
 
 
attitude, individual efforts, and individual differences. The scrutiny of these 
factors is necessary to comprehend the causes of language acquisition.  
The first one is age. It is believed that those who learn second language 
before the age of puberty will have greater possibility to acquire native-like 
pronunciation (e.g. Fledge, Yeni-Komshian, & Liu, 1999, Jhonson and 
Newport 1989). The second one is ear perception. It is tangible if listening 
ability is vital in the process of acquiring spoken language. If the ear perception 
is damaged, there is no way the acquirer could figure or identify the phonemes. 
Failure in identifying phonemes surely leads to committing mispronunciations.  
The third internal factor is aptitude. It is the natural ability or interest 
toward learning English. This factor is considered because it deals a lot with 
the fourth internal factor, that is, motivation. Motivation and aptitude 
determine the effort and also the willingness of the acquirer to exert the best 
English performance. Carroll in Ellis (2008) identifies that language aptitude 
comprises four factors; the ability of phonemic coding, grammatical sensitivity, 
inductive learning and rote learning ability. Phonemic coding ability is the one 
in line with this study.  If the aptitude is low, the motivation could also be 
suspected high because the ones with no ability from the beginning tend to 
improve so that they could have one. Such remark could also be vice versa. It 
depends on empirical situation.  
Stand next to motivation and aptitude are attitude and individual goals 
(Ellis, 2008). Attitude is also influencing the motivation and also the individual 
efforts. Even when one has a good aptitude, if English appears to be less 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

26 
 
 
 
interesting, there is no way the individual effort is high. That‟s how attitude is. 
One does what one like just fine. The last one is individual differences. The 
notion of individual‟s personalities is generally classified into three types. 
Ortega (2013) classifies them only as extraverted and introverted but there is 
one more personality, that is, ambiverted. Extraverted (open-minded, high risk 
taking, feeling oriented, perceiving tendency etc.) and introverted (less open-
minded, low risk taking, thinking oriented and judging tendency etc.) are quite 
common and affects the previous internal factors. Ambiverted is neither 
introvert nor extravert. It is rather the combination of the two. 
b. External Factors 
The aspects which are beyond the individual‟s possession and influence 
the acquisition of their L2 pronunciation are considered as external factors. 
Tanner (2012) proposes three factors as external causes for influencing the 
acquisition of highly intelligible pronunciation. Those factors are mother tongue, 
exposures and also educational factors. All of those factors are the things in 
which the acquirers are not equipped. It affects their pronunciation mastery from 
the outside. 
From the previous clarification, it is clear that the acquisition of native-
like pronunciation is quite affected by various causes. It could be expected that 
every single acquirer of highly intelligible English pronunciation must have 
gone through different experiences. With those various factors affecting the 
acquirer differently, the criteria of English pronunciation referred in this study 
are supposed to be clearly clarified. It is to provide a prerequisite for the 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

27 
 
 
 
upcoming clarification dealing with how intelligibility is measured. Hence, the 
notion of the native-like pronunciation is also to discuss. 
c. The Criteria of Native-like Pronunciation 
The notion of being native-like and comprehensibility of pronunciation 
has always been overlapping and conflicting (Levis, 2007).  The principle of 
being native-like deals with how strong the accent of the speakers is perceived. 
It is related and labeled as accentedness. Meanwhile, comprehensibility deals 
with the difference between the pronunciation of L1 and L2. Derwing and 
Munro (2005) have a specific perspective toward such matter.  In assessing 
intelligibility and comprehensibility, the distinction lies on the form of the 
assessment. Intelligibility is assessed using transcription task while 
comprehensibility is assessed by human / native speaker‟s rater judgment. 
From the previous information, the criteria of English native-like pronunciation 
in this study could be constructed as below: 
a. 
One is having self-identified, being perceived and/or having 
determination of being native like 
b. 
L2 is learnt at least after childhood. 
c. 
L2 pronunciation is accented. 
d. 
L2 pronunciation is judged and acknowledge by native-speakers. 
e. 
L2 pronunciation covers both intelligibility and comprehensibility. 
f. 
L2 is acquired naturally or instructively. 
There are abundant studies during 60s up to 90s which state that native 
likeness is impossible. However, Abrahamsson and Hyltenstam (2005) with 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

28 
 
 
 
their research finding out of 195 native like-perceived participants, has proven 
that native-likeness is indeed possible, even common for those who learn L2 
after childhood. 
d. Remarks on Native-like Pronunciation as A Cornerstone 
Second language learning and acquisition is ubiquitous around the globe. 
There exist native and non-native language speakers. There will be 
communication between natives, natives with non-natives as well as non-
natives with no-natives using the second language. Then, is native-like 
pronunciation crucial in this case? 
Episcopo (2009) studies the native speakers‟ attitude toward the non-
native speakers‟ accent. The result shows that listeners base attitude judgment 
more on native-likeness instead of intelligibility. It also shows that speaker‟s 
perception on his/her own non-native accent is more negative than how they 
rate themselves with others. 
Intelligible pronunciation is unquestionably important in enhancing the 
success of meaning negotiation of oral communication.  Even so, the native-
likeness of pronunciation deals not only with the aspect of understanding. It 
reaches beyond that. When one could acquire native-like pronunciation, there 
will be several aspects which will be positively affected such as self-
confidence, positive attitude from the audience, better communication and the 
success of meaning negotiation. 
Native-like pronunciation is indeed a rare phenomenon and those who 
are blessed could be so proud of it along with the advantages. However, scarce 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

as it is, the notion of being native-like has become quite a feisty determination 
for the foreign learners of the language. Such issue prevails on them to fight 
tooth and nail just to be acknowledged.  
In another side, highly intelligibility of pronunciation is different from 
the notion of being native-like. This one moderates the constraints of the 
pronunciation mastery and the pushy determination. It is, however, reflects the 
positive ability of the speakers in which their pronunciation could be well 
understood and secure the meaning negotiation. That is worth for appreciation. 
Thus, digging the information of how this highly intelligible pronunciation is 
acquired has become necessary. 
e. Intelligibility Principles 
Intelligibility is the state where a production of language is clear enough 
to comprehend.  It is defined as the ability of the listener to transcribe the 
actual words of utterance and comprehensibility as the overall ease in which a 
listener is able to understand the utterance (Derwing & Munro, 1997; Munro & 
Derwing, 1995). Under the notion of intelligibility, the speaker of L2 strives to 
being understood by both native and non-native speakers of the L2 itself 
(Levis, 2005). Thus, Jenkins (2000;2002) states that the speakers of L2 are to 
focus on the five principles features that make up Lingua Franca Core (LFC) to 
promote intelligibility such as: 
a. Changes to the consonant inventory 
b. Additional phonetic requirements 
c. Consonants clusters 
d. Vowel sounds 
e. Production and placement of 
stress 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

30 
 
 
 
The notion of intelligibility is different from that of essence. Being 
native-like is the one with accent salience which makes the speakers 
recognized as the speaker of accent this and accent that. On the other hand, 
intelligibility does not put accent as preponderant part of speech performance. 
It deals more with the clarity of the pronunciation performance. 
f. The Criteria of Intelligible Second Language Pronunciation 
The second language pronunciation in the context of this study is 
English. As mentioned before, Jenkins (2000) proposes the standard of English 
intelligible pronunciation in the context of foreign language. The standard‟s 
name is Lingua Franca Core (LFC). LFC is aimed to facilitate teaching 
intelligible English pronunciation toward EFL students. The latter comprises 
three phonological areas: segmentals, suprasegmentals and articulatory 
settings. The areas are grouped into two categories; core and non-core features. 
The LFC features could be scrutinized in the following summarizes by 
Deterding (2013). 
Table 2.2: A Summary of LFC Core and Non-core Features from Deterding 
(2013). 
Core Features 
Non-Core Features 
a. all the consonants of native-
speaker English except [θ] and [ð] 
b. aspiration on initial voiceless 
plosives 
c. initial and medial consonant 
clusters 
d. vowel length distinctions 
e. the quality of the NURSE vowel 
(/ nɜː s / vowel or the ɜː  sound) 
f. the placement of the intonational 
nucleus 
a. the TH sounds 
b.  final constant clusters 
c. dark-L 
d. vowel quality (except for the 
NURSE / nɜː s / vowel or the ɜ sound) 
e. vowel reduction (especially in the 
weak forms of function words) 
f. rhythm 
g.  word stress 
h. the shape of the intonational 
contour (rising, falling, etc.) 
 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

As the compass to be understood, the notion of standardized English 
pronunciation model indeed has always been a problem. It is due to various 
accents of the native speakers of English speaking countries, especially the 
inner circle countries (ICC). It raises questions and confusion to whomever 
non-native speakers of English being in the need of guidance to perform 
correct English pronunciation.  Hence, a standard as clarified previously comes 
in handy and meaningful. 
g. Remarks on Intelligibility as A Cornerstone 
Kirkpatrick (2013) emphasizes that English is an additional language 
with a main role as a lingua franca in ASEAN context. Hence, there is no need 
to go native-like. Even so, the need of deep cognizance toward intelligible 
pronunciation is a must especially for teachers, trainers or English instructors. 
It is to facilitate the learners so that they may get a good model of performing 
correct pronunciation.  
Lim (2016) also proposes that the attitudes toward English as lingua 
franca (ELF) determines ones‟ attempt to perform a comprehensive and 
intelligible English pronunciation. From this point on, it is undoubtedly 
preponderance for non-native speakers of English to master an intelligible 
pronunciation. Inasmuch as native-like L2 pronunciation is no better than 
cliché, intelligibility is the one possible to perform and the one which is more 
convenient. By being convenient means that intelligibility serves the speakers 
of L2 a stairway to comprehensible oral communication without so much effort 
for the speech organ to work exactly like the natives.

h. How to rate intelligibility 
To rate the intelligibility, this study relies on the pronunciation 
cognizance of the native speakers and English phonetician. As they are the 
inter-raters, each of them is to hold a rubric to assess the participants‟ 
pronunciation. The guideline provides the aspects to assess, the score, the 
criteria and the indicators of the measurement. Adapted from the speaking 
rubric by O‟ Malley, J. Michael and Pierce L. Veldez in Nurjanah, (2013) as 
well as modified from Collin Mees (2003), the guidelines could be scrutinized 
in the following table.

J. Michael and Pierce L. Veldez in Nurjanah, 2013)

The scoring system facilitates the inter-raters to be able to give their best 
opinion in measuring L2 speakers‟ pronunciation on their mother tongue. The 
values also enable the process of validating the data by applying Pearson‟s 
Coefficient Correlation. By having this, the participants are expected to be 
acknowledged as the ones possessing highly intelligible L2 pronunciation. 
3. Related Studies 
The study in this area is definitely prolific. Thus, there are several studies 
which are used and selected as reference and also parameter for this research. 
They could be scrutinized below.  
a) 
Niclas Abrahamsson and Kenneth Hyltenstam  (2009) studies age of 
onset and native likeness in second language which comprises listener 
perception versus linguistic scrutiny. 
b) 
Eun Seon Chung (2013) explores the degree of native-likeness in 
bilingual acquisition: second and heritage language acquisition of Korean 
case-ellipsis.

c) 
Joshua Tanner (2012) and Abbas Pourhosein Gilakjani (2012) study 
about the factors affecting the acquisition of second language 
pronunciation. 
d) 
Magdalena Syzyska (2015) proposes a term „good pronunciation users‟ 
instead of native-like speakers in her attempt to study the notion and the 
learning strategies of such pronunciation. 
Those mentioned above are just the tiny portion of examples of related 
studies in this area. The other attempts to study this topic are ubiquitous and 
could be access in this digital era. However, considering the narrowness and 
specification of the report, those studies are the one regarded close to the topic 
of this research. 
B. 
Theoretical Framework 
The study is mainly to find the most common factors relevant in 
influencing the acquisition of highly intelligible English pronunciation and 
employ five participants only. Since the research is a collective case study in 
nature, the description of distinct cases is the one being provided and clarified 
the most.  
The scrutiny of the cases of the five participants comprises four main 
clarifications: appearance of their English pronunciation which is recorded; 
their background such as origin, community, level of instruction; their personal 
thought and attempts such as motivation, consciousness and so on. Those 
qualitative data will be obtained via interview, pronunciation test, recorded 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

35 
 
 
 
voice of reading aloud activity, letter of statement, native speakers‟ judgment, 
phonetician judgment and also bio data.  
The first thing to do is to record the participants‟ voices when they read 
aloud the text. The next step is to have the participants to pronounce some 
particular English words which are common and less common to exist in 
English communication. After that activity, the participants‟ voices are going 
to be recorded using audacity. The last one is to do an interview comprising 
their background and some factors, either internal or external, influencing their 
L2 pronunciation acquisition

CHAPTER III 
RESEARCH METHODS 
 
 
This chapter provides the clarification of several aspects related 
to research methods. There are seven sections in this chapter. The sections 
include research design, setting, participants, justification for the participants, 
data, instruments and analysis.  
A. Research Design 
 This research is a case study. More specific, it is a collective case study 
inasmuch as it studies five cases in one loop (Ary et al., 2009). It is a 
qualitative research in nature. It relies on a detail description of a unique and 
rich event. This study aims to describe the richness and uniqueness of a 
phenomenon which, in this case, is the role of phonemic awareness toward the 
acquisition of highly intelligible second language pronunciation. 
  Cases are the units of analysis (Patton, 2002).  As the unit of analysis, 
this study has a highlighted focus which creates limitation (Miles a& 
Huberman, 1994). It is also determined by the design of stages which 
constitutes the case and becomes the base of the purposeful sampling (Patton, 
2002). In this case, the focus is the role of phonemic awareness in the 
acquisition of highly intelligible L2 pronunciation. 
 The research design of this case study employs three main steps (Cohen, 
Manion, Morrison; 2000). Similarly, Patton (2002) states that case study covers 
a process comprising three steps in general such as collecting, organizing, and 
analyzing. Cohen (2000) also states that the steps are explained briefly as 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

38 
 
 
 
„define & design‟; „prepare, collect & analyze‟; analyze & conclude. Those 
main three types could be explained further. The scrutiny of the detail steps 
could be scrutinized from the following picture. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.1: The Model of the Research Design of Case Study 
 As portrayed in the picture, the steps of doing this collective case study 
start with scrutinizing the phenomena and the related theory. The unique 
phenomena in this study are about high intelligibility in L2 pronunciation 
which is owned by particular EFL learners. It is ubiquitous to find fluent 
speakers of L2 in this world. However, those who could perform a highly 
intelligible second language pronunciation rarely exist (Szyska, 2015; Tanner, 
2012; Ortac¸tepe, 2013). This distinction is the one triggering this study. The 
learners of L2 are mostly going through similar process of language learning. 
In that case, how come the speaking performance or the product of spoken 
language learning could be far cry from each other? What are the factors 
influencing such phenomena? 
 Based on such queries, the next step is to select the cases. In this study, 
the selected cases are the ones which entail the perspective of highly 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

39 
 
 
 
intelligible L2 pronunciation acquisition. In this step, the design of the data 
collection protocol is also constructed.  
 The third step is conducting the case study. The data collection protocol 
will be carried out. In this step, the data collected come from many cases which 
are believed to contain the claim of the acquisition of the highly intelligible 
English pronunciation. The data are then analyzed and classified. 
After the data being gathered and analyzed, the next one is writing the 
individual case reports.  The report provides the description of each case which 
is derived from the content of the data gathered by the data collection protocol. 
From the data, the content of each description will be scrutinized and the rate 
of the pronunciation intelligibility will also be linked.  
 The last steps are to look back and to enrich the theory as well as to 
develop the implications of the findings inasmuch as case study is always 
different from one another. After that, the final report is written. Out of this 
collective case study, the most essential thing to do is to find whether these 
factors are applicable to set or to modify a technique to acquire highly 
intelligible English pronunciation. This one is also to see whether the 
applicable factors really are the cornerstone of an opening toward the mastery 
of English pronunciation. 
B. Research Setting 
The research was conducted in December 2016 up to the first semester of 
2017. The estimation of the implementation was based on the available time of 
the participants. Due to the background of the participants which are varied, the 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

40 
 
 
 
location for conducting the research was adjusted to the background of the 
participants.  
C. Research Participants 
There were five participants whose pronunciation was analyzed in this 
study. They were varied in terms of background and also the context of the 
process in acquiring their second language. As for the characteristics of the 
participants, there are some considerations to select them.  
First, the participants are Indonesian male/female adult who are in the 
range of age 20 – 40. These participants are to have been exposed to English 
after childhood (before 12 at most). It is incorporate the notion of age in 
language acquisition realm. The participants selected are the ones who used to 
or have been in an interaction with the native speakers (directly / indirectly 
through media). The next criteria is that the participants have self-belief to 
perceive him/herself and be perceived as highly intelligible speakers of 
English 
Those characteristics were still far cry from substantial due to the 
variety of the cases. The features were specified later as the participants‟ 
background context might be varied. Thus, the description was improved due 
to the latter. 
D. Justification for The Selection of The Participants  
The title of this collective case study is The Acquisition of Highly 
Intelligible English Pronunciation by Five Indonesian Speakers: A Collective 
Case Study. The variables are acquisition, high intelligibility and Indonesian‟s 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

41 
 
 
 
English pronunciation. The subjects of this research are English speakers who 
are Indonesian, which regards English not as their primary language, 
specifically those who possess highly intelligible English pronunciation. It 
means, the subjects of this research are to be believed by public that they do 
have the assumed pronunciation. Thus, the first thing to do in this research was 
to ensure the readers of the trustworthiness regarding the selection of the 
participants. In short, the researcher had to provide evidence which showed 
that the chosen participants do have highly intelligible English pronunciation.  
 
To avoid bias, the researcher used triangulation technique by using 
interview, expert judgment and inter-rater reliability. Interview was used to dig 
up the information for the sake of context scrutiny. This instrument is quite 
reliable since the participants share about their experiences. Expert judgment 
was done by having an Indonesian fluent speaker of English who has expertise 
on the language for years. 
As for the inter-rater reliability, there were two raters. One is a native 
speaker of British English and the other is a native speaker of American 
English. They were to give assessment on the participants‟ English 
pronunciation. In this study, the two raters who are both the natives of English 
were to identify the general assessment of English pronunciation performed by 
those five participants. These natives have lived in Indonesia for at least three 
years and more. They are also learners of Bahasa Indonesia and could perform 
the language comprehensively. As scholars and also travellers, they have gone 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

42 
 
 
 
to many English speaking countries. Thus, they are cognizant of the spoken 
performativity of those foreign learners of English.  
In line with Ortac¸tepe (2013), both of them have the same opinion of 
how to define intelligibility. It does not stop till that issue only. They both, in 
their own way, could identify and decide which Indonesian speakers exert 
highly intelligible English pronunciation and which do not. The following 
information covers how they define the latter issue. 
Intelligible English pronunciation is identified when the natives need 
clarification for what they have heard from the non-native speaker of English. 
It pops out when they, even though it is very scarce, find a sound which is 
ambiguous and lead them to confusion. They need to confirm whether that 
pronunciation is what the speaker really means. It is just to make sure and thus, 
it is intelligible only. Usually it is noted when the natives say “Sorry, was .. 
what you actually mean?” or “Did you mean?”. 
Highly intelligible pronunciation is identified when there is no 
confirmation needed. Meaning, the natives could comprehend the whole 
speech of the non-native speakers without even asking for clarification. The 
American rater in this study also said, “When you finish listening, something 
pops out in your mind just like „Ah, I got it‟.” It does not deal with particular 
English accent; it deals with how the speakers could perform correct 
pronunciation to enhance the success of flawless understanding in 
communication.

43 
 
 
 
 
As for the procedure, both of the raters were to listen to the participants‟ 
recorded voices. All of the recordings were in the form of audacity file and 
mp3 format. After listening to the recordings, the raters were to set the degree 
of the participants‟ English pronunciation intelligibility by scoring them out of 
nine-item guided rubric. The raters were also to give their remark in viewing 
intelligibility of non-native speaker‟s English pronunciation. In this case, the 
participants‟ were the ones remarked.

Once they had finished the assessment, the researcher collected the entire 
scoring sheet from both of the raters. To see the correlation between the scores 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

44 
 
 
 
from inter-rater 1 and inter-rater 2, the researcher employed Pearson‟s 
Coefficient of Correlation. Below is the correlation range indicating the degree 
of correlation. 
Table 3.2. The range of correlation degree proposed by Cohen in Perera, 
Heneghan & Badenoch (2008).

Using the above range, this technique is applicable in terms of seeking 
inter-raters‟ reliability. The scores were then classified in excel table and were 
calculated using the formula of Pearson‟s Coefficient of Correlation. The result 
of the calculation was to show whether the inter-rater reliability was in 
positive, negative, small, medium, or large correlation. 
The strength of the correlation provides secure evidence that the 
participants selected, especially for both their ability and their acquisition 
process, are truly qualified to study. Thus, the remarks are presented in the 
form of degrees. The raters are represented by letter A (stands for American) 
and B (stands for British).

PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

47 
 
 
 
 
From the previous table, there are some results which can be 
reported. The reports comprise the differences and the similarities in 
terms of the remarks from the raters. Below are the results. 
a. Both raters agree that speaker 1, 3, and 5 are easy to understand. As 
for speaker 2 and 4, the raters have different consideration to rate 
them „easy to understand‟ and „understandable‟.  
b. Both raters have no agreement in terms of accent. The American 
native scores more than 1 for all speakers. It means he admits that 
all participants have American accent even though it is slight. 
British rater scores only 1 for all participants. It means that no 
participant exert British accent in their pronunciation. 
c. Both raters agree that speaker 1, 3, and 5 are highly intelligible. As 
for speaker 2 and 4, the raters have different consideration to rate 
them „highly intelligible‟ and „intelligible‟.  
d. In terms of the strength of accent, both raters agree that only 
speaker 1 could gain stronger accent than their own. Stronger 
means very salient and represent the accent of a specific area  in 
English speaking countries.  For other speakers, British rater 
acknowledges only speaker 1, 2, and 3 who have stronger accent. 
Others are similar as his and weaker accent. American rater 
acknowledges only speaker 1, others are similar and slightly similar 
as his even weaker. 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

e. Both raters agree that only speaker 2 exerts very deep concern on 
the pronunciation. Other speakers exert some and slight concern. 
American rater even argues that speaker 1 speaks with no concern 
of pronunciation at all which means that the speech is natural. 
f. Both raters agree that speaker 1 and 3 speak very clearly. Raters 
have different opinion for speaker 2 and speaker 4, but both are 
considered clear. Speaker is considered slightly clear. 
g. Both raters agree that speaker 1 and 3 are very native-like. Both 
raters also agree that speaker 5 is native-like. for speaker 2 and 4, 
raters have different remarks. British rater states that speaker 4 is 
not native-like. 
h. Both raters agree that speaker 1 is totally aware of correct 
pronunciation. Other speakers are considered aware and less aware 
toward the correct pronunciation. British rater states that speaker 4 
is not aware of the correct pronunciation. 
i. Both raters believe that speaker 1 and 3 have naturally acquired 
their highly intelligible pronunciation of English through live and 
direct exposure. Other speakers are suspected to gain their mastery 
by learning through direct exposures and learning academically. 
After scrutinizing the individual scoring, next is analyzing the total 
score of each rater. The total score is analyzed using Pearson‟s Coefficient 
of Correlation to see if there is correlation between the two raters‟ remark. 
The following table comprises the information.

The result of the correlation or the r is 0. 67. It shows that both 
inter-raters have a strong positive and large correlation of agreeing that 
all participants are indeed highly intelligible. With this result, the 
selection of the participants is trustworthy and worth-taking for further 
analysis. 
Table 3.4. comprises the total score of the raters‟ assessment 
regarding each remark that they have conveyed . From the table, there are 
some interpretations which are necessary to report. Below are the noticed 
differences. 
a. The first one is the difference scoring between rater A and B in 
remark 2 which deals with accent. American rater argues that every 
speaker has American accent. British rater spots no one. It means 
that all speakers exert, learn and are into the use of American 
English for their speech. This happening is in line with the nature 
of British who own English as their L1 with less diversity in their 
nation than in America. 
b. The second information to notice is that all of the speakers are 
acknowledged to have highly intelligible English pronunciation.  
Even though the natives have acknowledged, the notion of 
intelligibility deals also with the micorskills of pronunciation. It is 
necessary to seek the opinion of an English fluent speaker who is 
cognizant of phonology. It is to see the segmental and suprasegmental 
issue. Thus, the expert judgment needs to be reported.

From the reports of table 3.6., it shows that all speakers have good 
awareness in exerting the intonation of their utterance. In terms of stress, speaker 
2 and 5 exert salient stresses which are considered excellent while other speakers 
are good. For the rhythms, all speakers‟ utterance is excellent. 
 Those three aspects are the representative of suprasegmental aspect. It is 
the part which makes a speech sound like native. By this very evidence, it means 
the speakers are aware of the other element of pronunciation which will affect 
their meaning negotiation.  
  The last one, accuracy, is the representative of segmental aspect. 
Mistakes in this aspect are also grave. In the report, the speakers have secured 
their pronunciation with correct individual phonemes. It means that the speakers 
are aware with the fact that a different sound could change the entire meaning of 
a word. 
With the implementation of the natives and expert judgment, the 
selection of the participants is done. Through these reports, it is shown that the 
participants are acknowledged to have highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
It also shows that this research trustworthiness is tangible. Then, this research 
could be preceded. 
E. Data  
The data is qualitative in nature. The source of the data was from the 
recorded voices of the participants who are believed to possess highly 
intelligible L2 pronunciation. Purposive sampling was employed for the data 
gathering in terms of the selection of the participants. The use of purposive 
sampling referred to the initial definition of the universe which was more 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

53 
 
 
limited (Miles & Huberman, 1994:27). The collection of the data itself 
involved two actions such as setting boundaries  (defining the aspects which 
were studied within the limits of times and means) and creating a frame to 
uncover, to confirm, to qualify the constructs that initiated this study (Miles & 
Huberman, 1994).  
As for the data collection, the study employed varied instruments, 
whether structured or unstructured, such as observation, reflective journal and 
interview. In this study, there were three main forms of instruments. They were 
interview, pronunciation test and reading aloud test.  
Thus, the data is in the form of description, recordings and also the rating 
or the scoring of phonemic awareness.  To enhance the trustworthiness of this 
study, triangulation was done as the one scaffolding the validation and the 
analysis employed the journalistic analysis (Cohen, Manion, and Morrison: 
2000). The data‟s trustworthiness was strengthened by employing the 
testimony of the native speakers of English. 
F. Instruments 
This study comprises some instruments for the data collection protocol. 
The instruments cover three main aspects. They are the form, the validity and 
reliability and analysis. As for the data gathering protocol, the data will be 
collected by doing these following activities.

Out of those activities, the data are in the form of description and also 
recordings. As for the trustworthiness, the research validity and reliability 
employ the native speakers‟ judgment as well as Pearson‟s coefficient 
correlation to validate the raters‟ judgment (inter-raters reliability). 
The testimony of the native speakers is in the form of rating score. It 
provides information regarding the view whether the participants‟ 
pronunciation is indeed highly intelligible or not. As for the inter-raters 
reliability, it serves as the evidence that the testimony of the native speakers are 
indeed in line with each other. 
G. Analysis 
After the data were collected, the next step was to analyze them. The 
analysis strived to provide a description of the context scrutiny which comprises 
the background of the participants. The data was analyzed by doing the 
following activities.

CHAPTER IV 
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 
This chapter talks about the content of the cases and the factors which 
appear to be the cornerstone for the participants regarding their acquisition of 
highly intelligible English pronunciation. There are two main sections which 
comprise the finding and the discussion of this research. Taken from the result of 
interviews, the sections are started with the report on cases, the report of the 
factors influencing the acquisition and discussion. As it is a collective case 
study, the main focus of the clarification is the similarities and links between the 
five cases out of the five participants.  
A. Findings 
The finding of this research comprises two main reports. The first one to 
report is the cases scrutiny. It is completely the description of each context of 
every participant. The second one to report is the factors which become the 
cornerstone of the acquisition of highly Intelligible English pronunciation. 
1. Cases Scrutiny 
Cases scrutiny contains three points of description at large.  The points 
are participant‟s experiences, constraints, and strategies. It also reflects the key 
to successfully acquire highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
a. Case 1 
The first case is from the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation by AMBA. AMBA is obviously an Indonesian native. It is 
noticed from her accent in her Bahasa Indonesia speech. Even so, those who 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

57 
 
 
learn English as their major of higher education in that seminar should have 
recognized the tendency of her English accent. Being a full-fledged Indonesian 
yet having highly intelligible English pronunciation is sure interesting to study.

acquisition. AMBA moved to The United States when she was only six 
following her parents to get their master and Ph. D. degree. During her stay in 
US, she found some difficulties to communicate inasmuch as she got no 
exposure of English before. However, AMBA was prevailed to master English 
as she was to mingle in the society and school. Her parents sent her to study 
English in ESL class in which the students came from all around the world.  
During her time studying in ESL class, she found herself frequently made 
mispronunciations due to the influence of her L1 (Palembangnese language). 
Her very first mispronunciation was the word „hamburger‟ which she 
pronounced [ˈhʌmˌbu.gə r] instead of [ˈhæmˌbɜː.gə ].  She was  ridiculed. Since 
that moment she always remembers the correct pronunciation of the word.  
Another moment of how she learned English which she distinctly 
remembers is the time when she was playing with her friends. Her friend said, 
“Sit down and I‟ll push you.” First, she responded but it did not meet her 
friend‟s expectation. So, her friend said, “No, no. Sit and I‟ll push.” 
Apparently, she was instructed to have a sit on a swing and her friend would 
push her. Instead of doing so, The First rushed up back home and found her 
mom. She asked the meaning of those words and after her mother translated 
them, she came back to her friend and did what she was asked. Such things 
happened quite often and she resolved with anything she could to catch up with 
her environment.  
“There was a time when my parents asked me to speak English only at 
home. I should do chores if I used Bahasa Indonesia.”  AMBA was prevailed 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

59 
 
 
to follow that very rule due to her lack of communication using English. After 
all, she was to live in USA for six years. 
At the age of twelve, she returned to Indonesia and found herself facing 
constraints adapting with Bahasa Indonesia after six years off this language. 
She passed through lots of similar experiences to the L2 acquisition which 
eventually helped her notice the ideal performance of the language. 
Nevertheless, even she had been through shifting languages, her English 
pronunciation remained intact.

From the above scheme, AMBA acquires second language in her critical 
period, that is, age six. Thus, L2 was naturally acquired. However, as it is told 
previously, the sense of strong awareness gives substantial contribution toward 
the process. Hence, she could distinctly remember the correct pronunciation as 
how the natives do.

b. Case 2

He claimed that he was only 2,5 years old when he was exposed to 
English as his second language. He got it from his brother‟s collection, the 
songs by Cheer. He listened to the songs frequently and, by the time he could 
talk, he tried to sing those song without comprehending the lyric. He merely 
imitated and whenever he mispronounced the words, his brother would be there 
to give him a positive correction and feedback. MEM strongly believes that he 
had no official English education when he was in kindergarten (he was only 4). 
Once he got it was when he was in the fourth grade of the elementary school 
but he found such lesson did not really help because the teacher was local and 
did not really facilitate him. 
 Listening was firstly introduced when he was in junior high school. He 
did join a speech contest in his last year of junior high. He started to fancy 
music and movies when he studied in senior high school. From these media, he 
got lots of exposures of English and his skill in imitating did serve him well.  
When he was seventeen, he moved to Salatiga for attending college (a 
Javanese city located in a faraway island from his own) and was exposed to 
Javanese language. Again, MEM learned the language which was spoken by his 
fellow classmates and Javanese friends. His Javanese along with the accent is 
very natural and native-like. The researcher, who is a full-fledged Javanese, 
could easily notice that the pronunciation he exerts is indeed similar to how the 
native Javanese. It is both for segmental and suprasegmental aspect though it 
does not represent a specific dialect. He got along just fine and his friends did 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

62 
 
 
 
expose the language which attracted his attention at most.  
“I started to be keen on recognizing and to learn English accent when I 
was 17. I watch YouTube movies a lot. I could distinguish the sounds and learn 
how to sound it by identifying which part of my mouth and other speech organs 
should I manipulate.” From his answer in an interview, the awareness is then 
raised by exposures and his own interest. Sure he had been through trial and 
errors in pronouncing the words but with the feedback from his friends, he 
could retain the correct and ideal pronunciation of Javanese language.  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.2: .The Second Language Phonological Acquisition by MEM 
There was a time when he returned home to Ambon and did not practice 
Javanese at all for two months. Different from the case of AMBA previously, 
MEM did not find any difficulty in recalling the language when he came back 
to Salatiga. He speaks Javanese like the natives. 
From that piece of information, it may seem that MEM is a prodigy in 
terms of acquisition. The process of language acquisition is fast, even when he

got his L3. The wonder arises when he was learning this L3 in the age of adult. 
 Sure he has some constraints but the skill of imitating surely will not 
serve him in recalling the correct pronunciation of his L3 after two months 
away from it. The awareness does, though. The attention he got from his friend 
becomes the selected stimuli which are eventually stored in the long-term 
memory. A direct method and environment surely help him a lot but the state 
where he gets along with the people and gets himself corrected is the strong 
candidate for suspecting the latter memory storing. 
 
c. Case 3 
 
The third case is from the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
pronunciation of AMBIKA. AMBIKA is a student majoring in English

Born in Lombok, AMBIKA has gained Bahasa Indonesia as her second 
language after she has mastered her L1, Sasakese. Her father was a scholarship 
awardee and moved along with the family to Australia. AMBIKA then started 
her pre-education when she was only 3 in Australia.  For the first three years 
they lived in Australia, AMBIKA also went to kindergarten in Gumnut, 
Australia as well. She spent Kindie School for two years. At the age 6, she went 
back to Indonesia and enrolled to Indonesian state elementary school for a year. 
Not long after that, AMBIKA joined his father to go back to Australia and 
enrolled in Australian elementary school. She was first to join ESL class for 
few months before continued her study up to 6th grade. Up to this state, she has 
found that her Australian accent is very salient and well-mastered.

Figure 4.3: .The Second Language Phonological Acquisition by AMBIKA 
At the age of 13, she went back home to Indonesia and enrolled to 
Indonesian Junior High school in Lombok after being transferred from 
Australian junior high school. During that adaptation time, she was treated just 
like a celebrity from foreign country. Teachers and friends regarded her as a 
distinguished student. She was famous for her „strange‟ English accent. The 
accent was very native yet the pronunciation could not be understood easily. 
Her friends once said “Bahasa Inggrismu kok aneh gitu sih?”. It literally 
means why her English accent was strange. AMBIKA found herself being 
ridiculed more rather than being admired. At that very time, she tried so hard to 
practice American pronunciation.  
During the time of her study from junior high school up to her current 
study, AMBIKA joins lots of competition dealing with English. She is always 
found to be prominent when it comes to English. Her teachers and those who 
are in charge to teach them always give compliments and notice her ability.

From this state, she is frequently asked to join English championship. 
AMBIKA has joined speech competitions, scrabble championship, been master 
of ceremonies in some occasions in her college and been one of formidable 
debaters in Jogja Debating Forum (JDF). She keeps being the champion.    
AMBIKA loves accent. After her awareness of pronunciation distinction 
has been awoken, she falls in love with the study of accent. She finds no 
difficulty when it comes to distinguishing sounds.  She did repeat the words 
along with the pronunciation few times.  
 
d. Case 4 
 
The forth case is from the acquisition of highly intelligible pronunciation 
of YZA. YZA is a pure Indonesian who has never gone abroad. Thus, his very 
first language is Javanese and Bahasa Indonesia becomes his second language. 
Currently he works as an operator in a particular call center for its foreign 
customer. His English pronunciation is quite favored by the customers also by 
his colleague and bosses. It could be seen from the frequency of customers‟ 
confirmation regarding his origin which they mostly assume an English native. 
This ability of fluent speaking along with highly intelligible English 
pronunciation is interesting and invites some queries. When YZA was asked of 
how he could pronounce the words that way, he answered “I just knew it. It is 
like, I have predicted what will be said next and what as well as how to say 
that. Just like, automatically summoned.”  This answer is surely inviting the 
researcher to know more about YZA and here is the biodata.

He started his education in kindergarten when he was only five. 
Spending only a year, he continued to enroll in elementary school at the age of 
6. He finished his primary education on the normal course as well as the next 
higher education. At the age of 18, he enrolled in a university majoring in 
management. He admits that he learns English just at school, surely the whole 
time of his primary and high school times along with two semester English 
classes in university.

Figure 4.4: .The Second Language Phonological Acquisition by YZA 
YZA had a rough childhood. He grew up to be a child who was less 
sociable due to issue of his family situation. Thus, he spent his times mostly by 
playing games. The games language instruction was English. Little YZA had 
no idea what the language means but somehow he knew what to do. He 
enjoyed playing game much more rather than hanging out with other kids. If he 
had few friends coming over, he would invite them to play the game with him. 
This was most likely his very first time having contact with English as an 
authentic exposure and so he claimed. 
Out of that issue, gaming has become his life. English as the language 
of the game has remained intact in his memory. He admits his English 
pronunciation has been mastered out of imitating the sounds he used to hear in 
the games. The situation goes on and on till he has fully grown up. His friends 
in university noticed his remarkable English speaking and pronunciation. They 
invited him to join debate competition. His ability to speak and to exert English 
pronunciation is truly head shoulders above the rest. He was taught as a native 
of English at first.

Surabaya. The kindergarten had already taught her English. In 1994, it was 
quite an advanced kindergarten in Indonesia to have English as one of the 
subject. It was her very first contact with English. AMBALIKA then enrolled 
to an elementary school when she was 7.  
In second grade, she had to move to Yogyakarta.  In this city she 
finished her education up to master degree. During high school period, she 
started to notice her ability in mastering English, the subject which she is so 
fond of. When she was asked why English becomes her interest, she answered 
that she got the highest score in English subject. She knew she has that talent 
and the inspiration from her English teachers also had got her best interest. 
Here, she joined English championship such as storytelling and speech 
competitions. Her teachers invited her to join the championship because her 
English speech was head shoulder above the rest.

simply because my English score was always the best. My English teachers 
inspire me a lot. That‟s when I knew I had the talent in English.” That 
statement refers to when AMBALIKA was 13-15 years old. It means that, 
during her period as teenager, she had acquired good spoken English and 
sharpened it till becoming fluent and highly intelligible as she currently is. Her 
job as an English teacher, which requires her to use the language, prevails her 
to always practice. She is also trusted to be English master ceremony in any 
conference using English as the instructional language. 
 
2. The Factors Being the Cornerstone of the Acquisition of Highly 
Intelligible English Pronunciation 
From the previous description, the contexts which are varied have 
provided some information regarding the factors being the cornerstone of the 
acquisition of highly intelligible English pronunciation. In this section, the 
factors which similarly appear in each of the cases are classified.  
From case 1, there is some information that speaker 1:

The information is quite varied from each case. Thus, it is necessary to 
find the similarities of each case. This way, the factors being the cornerstone of 
the acquisition of highly intelligible English pronunciation could be scrutinized.  
To see the whole landscape, all of the information are collected and are 
presented in one chart. Hence, the cross-cases scrutiny could be seen in the chart 
on the next page.

Other than the context scrutiny, the factors influencing the acquisition of 
highly intelligible English pronunciation are joining debate, joining speech 
championship, joining public speaking. The factors such as perceived to be 
accented, exposed to English in age before 7, being ambiverted are also 
influential.  Other than that, learning English non-academically and academically 
and excellent at imitating English sounds also give crucial effect on the 
acquisition of highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
 
From the previous context scrutiny, the findings show that there are six 
factors which appear to be similarly experienced by all participants. It means that 
those factors have significant contribution in all participants‟ process of 
acquisition. Hence, it is necessary to discuss further regarding these findings.  
B. Discussion 
From the context scrutiny and the finding, the result is more or less in line 
with some of the problems identified in the beginning of the research. The 
following is the points of the influential factors which has met the expectation.

PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

76 
 
 
 
Out of those points, there are more factors which need to scrutinize and to 
share. The factors are the ones which are drawn from the analysis result of the 
participants‟ selection up to the result of interview. The following are the 
clarifications of what new in the empirical finding. 
1. Age  
From the scrutiny, the age in which the participants are exposed to English 
for the first time is before 7. Some are even started much earlier (age of 3-4). In 
this age, the empirical data is in line with the critical period theory which  believes 
that those who learn second language before the age of puberty will have greater 
possibility to acquire native-like pronunciation (e.g. Fledge, Yeni-Komshian, & 
Liu, 1999, Jhonson and Newport 1989).  It supports the theory that learning 
second language before 10 is much easier and faster. With this finding, it could be 
an anchor for whoever wishes to support their beloved young children or anyone 
to learn foreign language as early as possible. That makes it a cornerstone. 
2. Second Language (L2) 
The result of the scrutiny shows that all of the participants masters Bahasa 
Indonesia. Three participants have Bahasa Indonesia as their second language 
and only two have it as the first language. This finding shows that L1 and L2, 
even though they create some barriers, they do not totally block the acquisition 
of highly intelligible pronunciation. The ability seems to be not gravely affected 
by the existence of other languages which are mastered. It appears to dwell side 
by side in the left hemisphere of the brain.  
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

77 
 
 
 
In fact, L2 helps all participants to create the sound of foreign language. It 
is possible because Bahasa Indonesia as their L2 (or even L1) is a language 
created out of many languages which are absorbed and used. It is rich of 
phonemes. Moreover, Indonesian are commonly in possession of various mother 
tongue which builds high tolerance toward the acquisition of pronunciation. It is 
in line with the notion of interlanguage which functions as transitory language as 
explained in Luna (2010). Thus, L2 is the cornerstone of acquiring highly 
intelligible English pronunciation. 
3. Motivation  
The result shows that the motivations of the participants are mostly 
integrated. All of the participants find themselves being perceived as good 
pronunciation user. They are motivated to learn English pronunciation because 
they already knew that they have the talent. They simply want to sharpen it for 
their own better speech performance. It is all in line with the notion of internal 
factors as explained in Ellis (2008). Thus, being motivation is the cornerstone of 
acquiring highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
4. ESL Class 
Only two participants join ESL class during their childhood because 
they used to live abroad. The rest participants do not enroll to such class. 
With this difference, they still manage to be acknowledged to have highly 
intelligible pronunciation. ESL class then has no significant influence for the 
acquisition. In this finding, it is also shown that the force of using only 
English in a diverse community is not the only way to acquire highly 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

78 
 
 
 
intelligible English pronunciation. However, it affects the acquisition of 
accent which is entailed in the acquirer‟s speech.  
5. Been/never been abroad 
Only two of the participants have never been abroad. The rest of the 
participants have been abroad for years or at least two months. With this 
difference, they still manage to be acknowledged to have highly intelligible 
pronunciation. The state of been or never been abroad then has nothing to do 
with the acquisition. It also shows that the exposure of live English and 
recorded authentic English give the same contribution in terms of the 
acquisition of highly intelligible pronunciation. 
6. Imitating Sounds 
All of the participants admit that they have been exerting to learn correct 
pronunciation by imitating. It means that imitating plays a role toward the 
acquisition of highly intelligible pronunciation. Imitating requires high 
awareness of phonemes recognition. This finding shows that all participants 
are cognizant toward the distinction of sounds and also the function of speech 
organs quite well. It is shown by the very evidence in which they try to repeat 
and check whether what they pronounce sounds just right or less. The 
cognizance of speech organ used is not always that of the ones taught in 
phonology class. It is a natural ability of human being who has more concern 
in the notion of pronunciation. 
 
 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

79 
 
 
 
7. Parents Role 
Only one out of the five participants has a rule from her parents, that 
is, speaker 1. The intervention from parents is initiated to enhance her new 
language acquisition abroad. Indeed, the native raters acknowledge this 
speaker as the most intelligible of all participants and in most aspects of 
pronunciation. It means that any artificial rule situated to improve the 
intelligibility of English pronunciation is quite effective. However, the role of 
parents here is not a must to acquire a highly intelligible English 
pronunciation. 
8. Personality  
All participants are ambiverted. They are neither extraverted nor 
introverted. All participants rather have the combination of the two, which 
means they are flexible enough to deal with any situation affecting the 
process of the acquisition. This personality does affect their willingness to 
acquire the ability. Personality also determines the attitude, motivation and so 
on. Thus, being ambiverted is the cornerstone of acquiring highly intelligible 
English pronunciation. 
9. Environment 
Environment like that of speaker 1 and , that is in USA and Australia 
has explained the success of the acquisition. However, the other speakers who 
have never been surrounded by such environment could still manage to be 
like them. However, they create their own environment with English 
exposures. They use internet, songs, videos, games and any mean which 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

80 
 
 
 
enhance their environment. Thus, environment is the cornerstone of acquiring 
highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
10.  Joining English championship 
All participants used to join English championship. They joined it 
during their learning period (at junior high, senior high even in college). 
Though they have acquired correct English pronunciation, the championship 
prevails them to be more intelligible. Thus, joining English championship is 
the cornerstone of acquiring highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
11. Perceived accented 
All participants are perceived accented. It plays its role in the 
microskills of pronunciation. When they are perceived accented, it means that 
they are aware of specific features of a spoken language. Speaker 2 was once 
perceived as a Dutch by the British rater. It shows so much awareness in 
segmental and suprasegmental aspects which contributes a lot to the process 
of acquiring highly intelligible pronunciation. Thus, perceived accented is the 
cornerstone of acquiring highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
From the preceding discussion, it could be seen that there are many factors 
which are potential to be the cornerstone of the acquisition of highly intelligible 
English pronunciation. Those factors are quite applicable in Indonesia especially 
for the development of teaching and learning pronunciation technique. They are 
also applicable for those who wish to be a polyglot in their early age. Then, the 
factors being the cornerstone of the acquisition of highly intelligible English 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

81 
 
 
 
pronunciation are age, L2, personality, motivation, exposure, environment, joining 
English championship, perceived accented. 
C. Other Findings  
Other than the previous information, the findings also show some other 
facts about the factor of being abroad. The result implies that being abroad has 
negative and also positive impacts toward the acquisition of highly intelligible 
pronunciation. Being abroad in English speaking country means having the 
acquirers surrounded by the very source of the language and it strengthens the 
acquisition very positively.  However, those who are situated abroad when the 
acquisition process is in progress could possibly produce not only good but also 
less good English. It depends on the situation and the environment of the acquirers 
and what kind of English the native speakers use. Those who are surrounded by 
the natives who are less educated probably take over their English which is less 
formal or even less standardized. Thus, being abroad does not guarantee the 
acquisition of good English because it is still influenced by other factor, that is, 
exposure. 
The common problems which are shown in the findings are the 
acceptability of particular accent (Indonesian prefers American and British due to 
the familiarity after colonialism era), foreign phonemes, the adaptation and 
manipulation of speech organs to produce targeted phonemes, and also partners to 
practice. All of the common problems turn out to be well-coped since the five 
participants here also concerns on those problems. Thus, they put their best 
interest to cope with their own strategies against the constraints. What they 
consider the „keys‟ of the success in acquiring that appreciated pronunciation are 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

82 
 
 
 
ear perception, awareness of distinct phonemes, lots and various exposure, 
motivation to practice and having somebody to boost their motivation. The latter 
shows that appreciation is extremely influential toward the motivation of oneself 
to do positive act. It stimulates the internal factors of that oneself.  Hence, if 
somebody wishes to encourage his/her children to acquire this pronunciation, 
giving reasonable appreciation is the best facilitate of all. 
Another fact about highly intelligible English pronunciation lies on the 
exposure. The exposure of Standard English which is taught academically turns 
out to be more acceptable and intelligible at large than that of the one people use 
for particular and communal purpose.  Songs and videos of English are good 
sources but they do not guarantee the correctness of grammar and pronunciation. 
It is recommended to consider podcasts and news. Thus, it is very necessary to 
watch over and to select the kind of exposure for learning pronunciation.

CHAPTER V 
CONCLUSION, IMPLICATION AND SUGGESTION 
A. Conclusion 
Pronunciation is indeed the heart of oral communication. A good and 
correct pronunciation of a spoken language leads into an effective association of 
meaning which enables the speaker and the audience to share the same 
understanding. It is a universal truth that the success of meaning negotiation is 
the one sustaining a good communication. The impacts of failure in mastering 
good pronunciation could be serious (Benrabah-Denjane, 2009). For the sake of 
successful meaning negotiation, highly intelligible English pronunciation is 
essential. 
The result shows salient and similar factors which are experienced by the 
five participants to improve and to robustly strengthen the remembrance of the 
correct pronunciation. The cross-cases context scrutiny probes similar factors 
facilitating the acquisition of highly intelligible English pronunciation. They are 
joining debate, joining speech championship, and joining public speaking. The 
factors such as perceived to be accented, exposed to English in age before 7, 
being ambiverted also occured in every participant‟s acquisition..  Other than 
that, learning English non-academically and academically and excellent at 
imitating English sounds are also possessed  by all of the participants duirng the 
acquisition process of highly intelligible English pronunciation. 
 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

84 
 
 
 
The factors which become the cornerstone of the acquisition of English 
pronunciation which is highly intelligible are in line with the previous theories 
but also show a new breeze. Those factors are generally in the loop of age, L2, 
personality, motivation, exposure, environment, joining English championship, 
perceived accented. In brief, the findings of this research have probed the nature 
of acquisition process of English pronunciation which is highly intelligible, 
show how essential it is and show the breakthrough to acquire it. 
B. Implication 
The findings could be useful for developing technique to achieve highly 
intelligible English pronunciation. It is useful for non-native speakers and their 
young generation to escape from being stigmatized by foreign accent. The 
findings also could be an anchor for whoever wishes to support their beloved 
young children or anyone to learn foreign language as early as possible.  
This research also shows that highly intelligible English pronunciation 
by Indonesians does not imply that it is the best pronunciation possessed by the 
EFL learners. It is merely a window to see whether those people have 
experienced constraints or not, what the constraints are and so on. It is merely 
about how to cope and how to acquire.  
The result also shows that there are many possible ways which could be 
constructed to acquire highly intelligible English pronunciation. There are 
various and applicable as how the participants have undergone in their own 
process of acquisition. This one goes especially for those who are interested in 
PLAGIAT MERUPAKAN TINDAKAN TIDAK TERPUJI

85 
 
 
 
young learners, teaching-learning pronunciation, parents who concern on 
language acquisition and so on.  
C. Suggestion  
Having highly intelligible English pronunciation should be nice. It 
helps lots of people to avoid failure in oral communication. Thus, further 
research in this area is worth conducting. It would be wonderful if the 
techniques for improving pronunciation could be created by using the findings 
of this research as the reference. The one who wishes her lineage to master 
more than one language and perform them just the way natives do will 
probably find this case study useful. The parents who find it as the best interest 
could set a good way to facilitate the child‟s language acquisition based on the 
knowledge shared by the participants. Hopefully, it would positively be useful 
and meaningful.

APPENDICES 
TEXT TO READ ALOUD 
A. 
Passage 1 
 
The rattles with which a rattlesnake warns of its presence are formed by 
loosely interlocking hollow rings of hard skin, which make a buzzing sound when 
its tail is shaken. As a baby, the snake begins to form its rattles from the button at 
the very tip of its tail. Thereafter, each time it sheds its skin, a new ring is formed. 
Popular belief holds that a snake‟s age can be told by counting the rings, but this 
idea is fallacious. In fact, a snake may lose old skin as often as four times a year. 
What is certain, however, is that the older the snake, the more rings it has, and the 
louder it buzzes. 
B. 
Passage 2 
 
Several different bison species have lived on the North American 
continent since the Ice Age; today only two exist. The wood bison is the larger of 
the two, and is now found mostly in western Canada. Better known in the United 
States is the Plains bison, or buffalo. At one time, herds of these animals could be 
sighted almost everywhere from the Appalachian Mountain in the East to the 
Rocky Mountains in the West. 
C. 
Passage 3 
 
A quilt is a bed cover made of squares of material pieced together. Each 
square consists of two layers filled with a layer of wool or cotton cloth, feathers, 
or down. Often, the squares are decorated with fancy stitches and designs. 
According to legend, the earliest pieced quilt was stitched in 1704 by Sarah 
Sedgewick Everett, wife of the governor of the Massachusetts colony. By 1774 
George Washington was buying quilts in Belvoir, Virginia, to take back to Martha 
in Mount Vernon. As the frontier moved westward, quilting went along. In 
addition to sleeping under them, homesteaders kept out drafts by hanging quilts 
over doors and windows. And if the money ran out, quilts were used to pay debts.

For isolated pioneer women, quilts were a source of comfort. Mary 
Wilman, whose family moved to Texas from Missouri in 1890, recalled the first 
time she and her mother had to spend a week alone and a dust storm came up. 
“The wind blew for three days and the dust was so thick that you couldn‟t see the 
barn. My mother quilted all day, and she taught me how to quilt. If it hadn‟t been 
for quilting, I think we would have gone crazy.” 
 
Quilting provided an important social function for the women of the 
frontier as well. At quilting bees, women met to work on quilts and to share the 
latest news. Today, however, the homely quilt has become a costly cultural 
phenomenon. The International Quilt Festival in Houston, Texas, “world‟s fair of 
quilting,” attracted only 2,500 people and displayed only 200 quilts when it began 
a dozen years ago. This year there were more than 20,000 visitors and 5,000 
quilts, some of which sold for as much as $50,000.
