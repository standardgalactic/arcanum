Extracting the Universe
from the Wave Function
CERN Workshop on
Quantum Gravity and
Quantum Information,
March 2019

Quantum gravity is hard, but we’re not completely lost.
Guiding principles:
•What a quantum theory is (H, H, A)
•Classical gravity, Rmn – (1/2)Rgmn = 8pGTmn
•Quantum field theory
•Black hole entropy & evaporation
Save time by not worrying about:
•String theory, loop quantum gravity, AdS/CFT...

Hawking’s Legacy: black hole radiation,
evaporation, entropy, and unitarity

Black hole entropy:

Issues/questions from black hole evaporation
•
Generalized 2nd Law of Thermo:
•
What are the degrees of freedom underlying Sbh?
•
Is evaporation unitary? 
Or is information lost?
•
Is there a firewall at the
horizon, or a fuzzball inside?

Two routes to progress
1. Semiclassical. Consider quantum fields on a 
background spacetime, perhaps with 
quantum fluctuations thereof.
Focus: understanding BH info, putting it to use.
2. Fully quantum. Wave function of the universe.
Space (and time?) are emergent.
Focus: understanding locality and structure
of Hilbert space.

hard modes.

out of black holes?

Quantum-first gravity:
•
The universe is just a vector evolving smoothly in 
a Hilbert space. Not a function “of” anything.
•
Fundamental concepts: states, tensor products,
factors, density operators, entropy, entanglement,
mutual information, Hamiltonian…
•
Derived (emergent) concepts: particles, fields,
forces, space, metric, locality, (time?)...
The challenge: finding our universe in the wave function.

[cf. Giddings 2007, 2015]

Three angles on quantum-first gravity
•
AdS/CFT. Bulk geometry arises from boundary
entanglement. (van Raamsdonk, Swingle, others)
•
Learn what we can from gauge QFT’s.
Hilbert-space structure, 
algebra of observables, etc. (Giddings)
•
Start with locally-finite-dim. Hilbert spaces.
Use entanglement to define geometry.
Space, locality, field theory are emergent,
ultimately from the Hamiltonian.
(Carroll, Bao, Cao, Chatwin-Davies, Singh, &c.)

Non-Locality and structure of Hilbert Space
in Quantum Gravity (Giddings)
We tend to think we can factorize Hilbert space into 
a tensor product of regions,                        .
But that’s not really true, even in QFT. Define subsystems
using commuting subalgebras of operators.
In gravity, can’t even confine 
gauge-invariant operators to a region. 
Instead, “split structure”:

Hints of non-locality: holography, complementarity, unitarity
Two views of a black hole and its degrees of freedom:
[‘t Hooft; Susskind et al; Giddings; Bao et al]
infalling observer: local
quantum field theory
external observer: degrees of freedom
spread holographically across horizon
Radiation from horizon starts very high-energy, so it’s
measuring the BH in a different way.

Firewalls?
Standard lore:
•A+B must be maximally 
entangled for no firewall;
•B+C must be maximally
entangled for unitarity.
•B can’t be maximally entangled with two things at once
But:
“Unitarity” is a statement about the 
global wave function of the universe.
“No firewall” is a statement about branches
describing semiclassical spacetimes.

Polchinski & Sully 2012]

Bell states:
If C+D is the “environment,” branching structure can have
A+B entangled on each branch. No logical contradiction.
No contradiction between B+C
being entangled in the global
wave function, and A+B being
entangled on every branch.
Toy model for global wave function:

Locally-finite Hilbert space
QFT has dim(H) = ∞ because energy
can be infinitely large.
But with gravity there’s a cutoff: 
try to fit too much energy in a 
region (more than E = L/2G), and 
you just make a black hole. Try to 
fit in more, and the black hole 
grows larger than L. [Bekenstein]
With gravity, only a finite # of things can happen in a 
region. Therefore we expect that dim(H) = finite.

Indeed we know what dim(H) is.
Black holes have entropy proportional
to the area of the event horizon:
This relates to dimensionality of Hilbert space of the region:
Suggests that regions of space are described by finite-dim
factors of Hilbert space. 
Obvious challenges for Lorentz invariance, gauge theory, etc.
[Bao, Carroll & Singh, 2017]

“Locally” is tricky if space itself is emergent.
Divide full Hilbert space into system (infrared, 
accessible degrees of freedom) and environment 
(ultraviolet or far-away ones). The system will have 
pointer states, robust under environmental monitoring.
These pointer states describe emergent macroscopic
regions of space. “Locally finite” means that finite-
dimensional factors of HIR describe compact regions
of the emergent space in some particular branch.
[Bao, Carroll & Singh, 2017]

Same goes for our universe, which
by the Cosmic No-Hair Theorem 
is asymptoting to de Sitter space.
And Cosmic No-Hair can be 
derived from the Generalized
Second Law of Thermodynamics:
Q-screen
[Dyson, Kleban & Susskind; Banks & Fischler]
Our de Sitter patch will be a maximum-entropy state with

space
Hilbert space is locally finite-dimensional.
Don’t need to specify an algebra of observables – it’s
simply “the set of all Hermitian operators.”
So we have the following picture:
our observable universe

Cosmic expansion and degrees of freedom
“Expansion of space”
Entanglement of initially unentangled 
ancilla degrees of freedom.
Consider a comoving region
of flat FRW cosmology 
with matter/energy.

region by a quantum circuit.

Mad-Dog Everettianism:
•Hilbert space HO, Hamiltonian H, and state |ψ>.
•Derive everything else, including space itself.
[Carroll & Singh, 2018]
The meager data we are given:
•an integer d = dim(HO)
•d real numbers, the energy eigenvalues of H
•d complex numbers, components of some state |ψ>.

Spacetime geometry from quantum entanglement
[cf. Swingle 2009; Van Raamsdonk 2010; Evenbly & Vidal 2011; Maldacena & Susskind 2014
AdS/CFT approach.
Wormholes in anti-de Sitter:
boundaries move apart as
entanglement between them
is reduced.
When looking for the key to quantum gravity, 
AdS/CFT is the world’s brightest lamppost.

Finding bulk space in Hilbert space
Consider a Hilbert space factored into finite-dim pieces.
Can we factor to represent local regions of space?
We can write the Hamiltonian as a sum of operators 
connecting all possible combinations of factors.
A “k-local Hamiltonian” is one where any factor only 
interacts with k other factors, its “nearest neighbors.”

Cotler, Penington, and Renard, 2017: 
•
Most Hamiltonians have no local factorization.
•
When it exists, locality is (mostly) unique.
E.g. for an n-qubit Hilbert space we would have:
parameters in a
k-local Hamiltonian
energy eigenvalues
(dim H)
So if the Hamiltonian can be written in a local form
at all (which we assume it can), locality (basically)
fixes what the factorization will be.

This notion of locality gives a graph structure and
a topology to a factorized Hilbert space. Geometry?
Given a pure state vector |Y>, 
the state on one factor (or a 
collection thereof) is given by 
its reduced density matrix: 
How entangled one region is with the rest of the world
is characterized by its von Neumann entropy:

How entangled two regions are with each other is 
characterized by their mutual information:
And mutual information provides an operator-independent
way of characterizing two-point correlation functions:
So nearby = higher mutual information.
Quantifying entanglement in QFT

Boldly conjecture that we can define an effective metric 
on the information graph associated with our
factorized-Hilbert-space states:
Less entanglement = further away.

Emergent gravity in the bulk
We have space; don’t have a Hamiltonian, dynamics, time.
But every density matrix r defines a “modular energy”:
Perturbing the quantum state changes both the entropy and
the modular energy. They obey the Entanglement First Law:
Change in the entropy of a region is proportional to the
change in modular energy.
[Blanco, Casini, Hung & Myers 2013; Faulkner et al 2014]

[Bousso, Fisher, Koeller, Leichenauer, and Wall 
2013]
Aside: conjecture from this workshop
Quantum Null Energy Condition:
Is there a Hilbert-space version?
Perhaps related to the Entanglement 1st Law:

Decreasing entropy decreases
entanglement, pushing points 
away, creating spatial curvature.
Therefore, spatial curvature at p is related to modular energy:
In long-distance (infrared) limit, our theory should behave
like a CFT. Then modular energy is related to ordinary energy:
Covariant version would be Einstein’s equation:
[Cao & Carroll 2017]

Prospects
•
Semiclassical gravity is clearly interesting and useful.
•
Hints of non-locality in BH evaporation.
•
We ultimately want to full quantum theory.
•
Maybe get there from Hilbert space directly, rather
than by quantizing a classical model.
•
Spacetime can plausibly emerge from entanglement,
complete with Einstein’s equation.
•
Hilbert space structure etc. still far from understood.
