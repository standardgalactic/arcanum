MEREOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS
OF POINT-FREE GEOMETRY
VIA MULTI-VALUED LOGIC
Abstract.
We suggest possible approaches to point-free geometry based on
multi-valued logic. The idea is to assume as primitives the notion of a region
together with suitable vague predicates whose meaning is geometrical in
nature, e.g. ‘close’, ‘small’, ‘contained’. Accordingly, some ﬁrst-order multi-
valued theories are proposed. We show that, given a multi-valued model
of one of these theories, by a suitable deﬁnition of point and distance we
can construct a metrical space in a natural way. Taking into account that
interesting metrical approaches to geometry exist, this looks to be promising
for a point-free foundation of the notion of space. We hope also that this
way to face point-free geometry provides a tool to illustrate the passage
from a naïve and ‘qualitative’ approach to geometry to the ‘quantitative’
approach of advanced science.

1. Introduction
Łukasiewicz’s many-valued logic (see [19]), Chang and Keisler’s contin-
uous logic [6], and Pavelka’s fuzzy logic [21] all form a very interesting
chapter of formal logic.
Recently, under the name ‘continuous logic’,
these work has been re-examined with a view to extending model theory
to important classes of structures that cannot be deﬁned in classical
ﬁrst-order logic [30], namely, all the structures assuming as a primitive

a real-valued function (metric spaces, measure spaces, normed spaces
and probabilities are typical examples). The idea is that it is possible to
reinterpret the real numbers as truth values and the real-valued functions
as vague predicates in a ﬁrst-order multi-valued logic.
In this paper we investigate the possibility of applying this idea to
point-free geometry (see also [8, 9]). The starting point is proposals for
a metric-based point-free geometry already existing in literature ([10,
11, 22, 23, 17, 14, 15, 16]). In each of these proposals, together with
the inclusion relation, distances and diameters are also considered and
a system of axioms T is proposed.
Moreover, it can be shown that,
given a model of T, it is possible to give a suitable deﬁnition of point
and distance and thence to obtain a metric space. Then, in accordance
with the ideas of the metrical approaches to geometry (see [2]), it is
possible to deﬁne the notion of an alignment of points and therefore
all the basic notions of geometry. Notice that these approaches are in
some way connected with the one presented by Tarski in [25] in which
one assumes the notion of ball as a primitive while the points and the
relation of equidistance are deﬁned (see also [18]).
The next step, in accordance with continuous logic, is to show that it
is possible to associate with each theory T based on real-valued functions
a theory T ∗in a multi-valued logic based on vague predicates that are
geometrical in nature (such as ‘small’, ‘close’, ‘contained in’, etc.). By
a sort of duality principle every model of T ∗is associated with a model
of T and therefore with a metric space. This gives a basis for the foun-
dation of Euclidean geometry.
We emphasize that one of the motivations is to give a mathematical
model of the transition from the naïve predicate-based theory of space,
which is qualitative in nature, to the modern real-number-based theory,
quantitative in nature. In this sense, fuzzy logic seems a signiﬁcant tool
for the analysis of the pre-theoretic scientiﬁc beliefs of ordinary man (see
[3, 24, 20, 5]). In turn, we are convinced that our research could be
useful when it comes to understanding the scientiﬁc view of the world
children have and how best to teach them science.

2. Preliminaries: algebra of the truth values
We consider multi-valued logics in which the set of truth values is the
real interval [0, 1] and the conjunction connective is interpreted by a con-
tinuous triangular norm.
Definition 1. A continuous triangular norm (brieﬂy t-norm) is a con-
tinuous binary operation ⊗on [0, 1] such that, for all x, y, z ∈[0, 1]:
• x ⊗y = y ⊗x (commutativity)
• (x ⊗y) ⊗z = x ⊗(y ⊗z) (associativity)
• x ⩽y ⇒x ⊗z ⩽y ⊗z (isotonicity)
• 1 ⊗x = x and 0 ⊗x = 0 (boundary conditions).
Once a t-norm is ﬁxed, we are able to deﬁne a further operation to
interpret the implication ⇒.
Definition 2. Given a t-norm, the residuation associated with ⊗is the
operation →deﬁned by
x →y := sup{z : x ⊗z ⩽y}.
The following proposition summarizes the main properties of →.
Proposition 1. If ⊗is a t-norm and →the associated residuation,
then for all x, y, z ∈[0, 1]:
(i) x ⊗z ⩽y ⇐⇒z ⩽x →y,
(ii) (x →y) ⊗(y →z) ⩽x →z,
(iii) x →y = 1 and y →x = 1 ⇒x = y,
(iv) x →y = 1 ⇐⇒x ⩽y,
(v) (z →y) ⊗z ⩽y.
Important examples of continuous t-norms are:
•
Gödel t-norm: x ⊗y := min{x, y},
•
Goguen t-norm: x ⊗y := x · y (usual product of real numbers),
•
Łukasiewicz t-norm: x ⊗y := max{0, x + y −1}.
The corresponding residuations are deﬁned by setting x →y := 1, if
x ⩽y and, otherwise:
•
Gödel residuation: x →y := y,
•
Goguen residuation: x →y := y
x,
•
Łukasiewicz residuation: x →y := x + y −1.
We are interested in a particular class of continuous t-norms, the
Archimedean t-norms.

Cristina Coppola and Giangiacomo Gerla
Definition 3. A continuous t-norm ⊗is called Archimedean if for any
x, y ∈[0, 1], y ̸= 0, there is a natural number n such that x(n) < y, where
x(n) is deﬁned by: x(1) := x and x(n+1) := x(n) ⊗x.
The usual product and Łukasiewicz t-norm are examples of Archi-
medean continuous t-norms, while the minimum is an example of con-
tinuous t-norm that is not Archimedean.
There is a general way to
obtain a continuous Archimedean norm which is based on the notion of
continuous generator.
Definition 4. An additive generator is a continuous strictly decreas-
ing function f : [0, 1] →[0, ∞] such that f(1) = 0. The pseudoinverse
f [−1] : [0, ∞] →[0, 1] of f is deﬁned by setting:
f [−1](y) :=
(
f −1(y)
if y ∈f([0, 1])
0
otherwise.
We list some properties of the pseudoinverse whose proofs are trivial.
Proposition 2. Let f be an additive generator. Then:
(i) f [−1] is order-reversing,
(ii) f [−1](0) = 1 and f [−1](∞) = 0,
(iii) f([0, 1]) = [0, f(0)],
(iv) f [−1](f(x)) = x, for any x ∈[0, 1],
(v) f(f [−1](x)) = f(0), if x ⩽f(0),
(vi) f(f [−1](x)) = f(0), if x > f(0),
(vii) f(f [−1](x)) ⩽x.
Definition 5. Let f : [0, 1] →[0, ∞] be an additive generator and deﬁne
the operation ⊗by setting for all x, y ∈[0, 1]:
x ⊗y := f [−1](f(x) + f(y)).
(⊗)
Then we say that f is an additive generator of ⊗.
Proposition 3. An operation ⊗is a continuous Archimedean t-norm
iﬀit is has an additive generator. In such case the residuation is deﬁned
for all x, y ∈[0, 1] by:
x →y := f [−1](f(y) −f(x)).
For example, the additive generator of the Goguen t-norm is f(x) :=
−ln(x) (where ln is the natural logarithm) and the additive generator
of the Łukasiewicz t-norm is f(x) := 1 −x.

3. Preliminaries: ﬁrst-order multi-valued logic
The languages of the ﬁrst-order multi-valued logic we will consider con-
tain:
•
the logical connectives: ∧, ⇒, Ct,
•
the quantiﬁers: ∀, ∃,
•
two logical constants: 0, 1,
•
predicate symbols,
•
constant and operation symbols.
We interpret the logical connectives ‘∧’ and ‘⇒’ by a t-norm and
the related residuum, and the logical connective ‘Ct’ by the function
ct : [0, 1] →[0, 1] deﬁned by setting ct(x) := 1, if x = 1, and ct(x) := 0,
otherwise. Given a formula α, the intended meaning of Ct(α) is that
α is completely true. The quantiﬁers ‘∀’ and ‘∃’ are interpreted as the
greatest lower bound and the least upper bound, respectively. The logical
constants ‘0’ and ‘1’ as the truth values 0 and 1. Given a non-empty set
D, an n-ary fuzzy relation in D is a map r: Dn →[0, 1]. We call crisp
a fuzzy relation whose only values are 0 and 1, and we identify a classical
relation R ⊆Dn with the crisp relation cR : Dn →[0, 1] deﬁned by
setting cR(d1, . . . , dn) := 1, if (d1, . . . , dn) ∈R, and cR(d1, . . . , dn) := 0,
otherwise.
In other words, we can identify R with its characteristic
function cR.
Definition 6. A multi-valued interpretation (D, I) of a multi-valued
logic consists of a nonempty domain D and a function I associating every
constant c with an element I(c) ∈D, every n-ary operation symbol with
an n-ary operation in D, and every n-ary relation symbol r with an n-ary
fuzzy relation r = I(r), i.e. a map r: Dn →[0, 1].
Given a multi-valued interpretation (D, I), the interpretation I(t):
Dn →D of a term t is deﬁned as in classical logic. The valuation of
a sentence is deﬁned in a truth-functional way as follows (if • is a unary
connective, •: [0, 1] →[0, 1] denotes its interpretation, and similarly for
binary connectives).
Definition 7. Given a multi-valued interpretation (D, I), a formula α
whose variables are among x1, . . . , xn, and d1, . . . , dn in D, the value
Val(α, d1, . . . , dn) is deﬁned by recursion on the complexity of α:
Val(0, d1, . . . , dn) := 0 and Val(1, d1, . . . , dn) := 1,
Val(r(t1, . . . , tp), d1, . . . , dn) := I(r)(I(t1)(d1, . . . , dn), . . . , I(tp)(d1, . . . , dn)),

540
Cristina Coppola and Giangiacomo Gerla
Val(α1⋄α2, d1, . . . , dn) := Val(α1, d1, . . . , dn) ⋄Val(αq, d1, . . . , dn),
Val(•α, d1, . . . , dn) := •(Val(α, d1, . . . , dn)),
Val(∀xhβ, d1, . . . , dn) := inf{Val(β, d1, . . . , dh−1, d, dh+1, . . . , dn) : d ∈D},
Val(∃xhβ, d1, . . . , dn) := sup{Val(β, d1, . . . , dh−1, d, dh+1, . . . , dn) : d ∈D}.
If α is a closed formula, then Val(α, d1, . . . , dn) does not depend on
the elements d1, . . . , dn and we simply write Val(α). In case there are
free variables in α, we write Val(α) to denote Val(∀x1 . . . ∀xn(α)), where
∀x1 . . . ∀xn(α) is the universal closure of α.
Definition 8. Given a multi-valued interpretation (D, I), we say that
a formula α is satisﬁed by (D, I) if Val(α) = 1. Given a theory T, i.e.
a set of formulas, if every formula in T is satisﬁed by (D, I) we say that
(D, I) is a multi-valued model of T.
The multi-valued logic that we have just deﬁned is quite expressive.
For example, if r is an n-ary relation symbol, then the formula:
∀x1 . . . ∀xn(Ct(r(x1, . . . , xn)) ⇔r(x1, . . . , xn))
is satisﬁed if and only if r is interpreted by a crisp relation. Indeed,
it is suﬃcient to observe that this formula is satisﬁed if and only if
ct(r(d1, . . . , dn)) = r(d1, . . . , dn), for all d1, . . . , dn in D. In other words,
‘to be crisp’ is a ﬁrst-order property of the multi-valued logic. Accord-
ingly, every classical notion we can deﬁne in ﬁrst-order classical logic is
deﬁnable also in the multi-valued logic. In particular, we can give the
following deﬁnition.
Definition 9. Given a language with the relation symbol ≤, we denote
by ‘Order(≤)’ the claim that the interpretation of ≤is a crisp order
relation.
4. Mereometrology and multi-valued logic: a general schema
The ﬁrst two steps toward point-free geometry are:
•
mereology: the theory whose only primitive notion is the binary “part
of” relation,
•
mereotopology: based on the binary “part of” relation and some ad-
ditional notions topological in nature.
These two steps suggest the possibility of a further step we call mereo-
metrology, its objective being the founding of a point-free geometry on

notions which are metrical in nature. Several explorations of this area
have been made in the literature. In this paper we will examine them and
introduce some minor modiﬁcations in order to emphasize their common
ideas and to unify the language.
The basic schema of the aforementioned theories may be summarized
in the following way.
1. One considers a theory T whose intended models are ordered sets
with elements called regions and the order called inclusion. This theory
involves further primitives that allow for the deﬁnitions of the notions
of the diameter of a region and the distance between two regions. T is
obtained by isolating some signiﬁcant properties of a prototypical model.
Usually this model is deﬁned in a subclass Re of the class RC of regular
closed subsets of the Euclidean space. Recall that a closed subset is called
regular if it is equal to the closure of its interior and that in the Euclidean
case RC is a complete and atomless Boolean algebra. In this paper we
set Re equal to the class of nonempty and bounded elements of RC.
Equivalently, we can consider the class of open regular subsets, i.e.,
the subsets which coincide with the interior of their closure.
2. Given a model of T, AP denotes the class of the order-reversing
sequences ⟨pn⟩n∈N of regions such that
lim
n→∞|pn| = 0,
where |x| is the diameter of a region x. We call abstraction processes the
elements in AP.
3.
Next, in AP the function d: AP × AP →[0, ∞) is deﬁned by
putting
d(⟨pn⟩n∈N , ⟨qn⟩n∈N) := lim
n→∞δ(pn, qn),
(†)
where δ(x, y) is the distance between regions x and y.
4. One proves that the pair (AP, d) is a pseudo-metric space and
therefore its quotient (AP, d) is a metric space. Then every model of T
is associated with a metric space (AP, d) such that:
•
elements of AP (points) are complete equivalence classes
⟨pn⟩n∈N
,
•
the distance between two points
⟨pn⟩n∈N
 and
⟨qn⟩n∈N
 is deﬁned
by setting
d(
⟨pn⟩n∈N
 ,
⟨qn⟩n∈N
) := lim
n→∞δ(pn, qn).
(‡)
The fact that every model of T is associated with a metric space is impor-
tant. Indeed if we add to T any system of axioms for a point-based foun-

542
Cristina Coppola and Giangiacomo Gerla
dation of Euclidean geometry metrical in nature (see e.g. [2]), then we
obtain a metric point-free foundation for Euclidean geometry. Obviously,
in this system points and distance are not primitive but deﬁned notions.
There is no diﬃculty connecting multi-valued logic with mereometrol-
ogy in accordance with the ideas of continuous logic. This is done by us-
ing an additive generator f : [0, 1] →[0, ∞] to establish a sort of duality.
5.
We show that for every theory T in mereometrology there is
a theory T in ﬁrst-order multi-valued logic such that every model of T
is transformed into a model of T via the function f. As a consequence,
every model of T is associated with a metric space. T involves vague
predicate for regions metrical in nature.
Observe that there is a diﬀerent way to deﬁne the points and therefore
the associated metric space. Call Cauchy sequence a sequence ⟨pn⟩n∈N
of regions such that:
lim
n→∞|pn| = 0 and (∀ϵ > 0)(∃m ∈N)(∀h, k ≥m) d(ph, pk) < ϵ .
Denote by CS the class of Cauchy sequences and deﬁne d as in (†). Then
one obtains a pseudo metric space (CS, d) and therefore a metric space
(CS, d). It can be proven that every representing sequence is a Cauchy
sequence and therefore that (CS, d) is an extension of (AP, d). An im-
portant fact is that (CS, d) is the completion of (AP, d) (see [10]).
5. Point-free geometry based on closeness and smallness
The ﬁrst example of the metrical approach we will consider is obtained
by assuming as primitives region, inclusion, distance and diameter. The
prototypical model is deﬁned in the class Re, where two functions δ: Re×
Re →[0, ∞) and |·| : Re →[0, ∞) are deﬁned by setting for all x, y ∈Re:
δ(x, y) := inf{d(P, Q) : P ∈x, Q ∈y},
|x| := sup{d(P, Q) : P, Q ∈x}.
It is immediate that δ is order-reversing, |·| is order-preserving, δ(x, x) =
0, and δ(x, y) = δ(y, x), for all x, y ∈Re. A more interesting property is
the following generalized triangle inequality, for all x, y, z ∈Re:
δ(x, y) ≤δ(x, z) + δ(z, y) + |z| .

Mereological foundations of point-free geometry . . .
543
We can prove it by observing that it is not restrictive to assume that
sets x, y, and z are closed and therefore that there are points P, Q, R,
S, V , W, T, and U such that:
PQ = δ(x, y),
RS = δ(x, z),
V W = |z| ,
TU = δ(z, y) ,
PQ ≤RU ≤RS + ST + TU ≤RS + V W + TU .
Finally, taking into account the properties of the regular subsets of
a metric space, we also have that:
∀x∀n∃z(z ≤x ∧|z| ⩽1
n).
This prototypical structure suggests the following deﬁnition.
Definition 10. A pointless pseudo-metric space (brieﬂy: ppm-space) is
a structure (R, ≤, δ, |·|), such that (R, ≤) is an ordered set, δ: R × R →
[0, ∞) is order-reversing, |·| : R →[0, ∞] is order-preserving, and for all
x, y, z ∈R the following axioms hold:
δ(x, x) = 0
(ppm1)
δ(x, y) = δ(y, x)
(ppm2)
δ(x, y) ⩽δ(x, z) + δ(z, y) + |z|
(ppm3)
(∀n ∈N)(∃z ≤x) |z| ⩽1
n .
(ppm4)
The elements of R are called regions; the relation ≤inclusion; the
number δ(x, y) distance between the regions x and y; the number |x| 
the diameter of x. A region x is bounded if its diameter |x| is ﬁnite.
It is easy to control that the deﬁned prototypical structure is a ppm-
space.

544
Cristina Coppola and Giangiacomo Gerla
Proposition 4. For all x, y ∈R, if there is z ∈R such that z ≤x and
z ≤y, then δ(x, y) = 0. Consequently, if there is a minimum in R, then
δ is constantly equal to 0.
Proof. If z ≤x, then δ(z, x) ≤δ(z, z) = 0. So, if z ≤x and z ≤y we
have that δ(x, y) ≤δ(x, z) + δ(z, y) + |z| = |z|. With (ppm4) this entails
that δ(x, y) = 0.
In accordance with the above proposition in the following we assume
that no minimum in R exists. Recall that AP is the class of abstraction
processes and d: AP × AP →[0, ∞) is deﬁned by (†).
Before stating the next theorem we introduce the notion of a pseudo-
metric space.
Definition 11. A pseudo-metric space is a structure (R, δ) such that
R is a non-empty set and δ : R × R →[0, ∞) is a mapping such that, for
all x, y, z ∈R:
δ(x, x) = 0
(d1)
δ(x, y) = δ(y, x)
(d2)
δ(x, y) ≤δ(x, z) + δ(z, y) .
(d3)
Theorem 1. (AP, d) is a pseudo-metric space.
Proof. To prove that AP is non-empty we observe that, by (ppm4),
for any region x we can deﬁne an abstraction process ⟨pn⟩n∈N by setting
p1 = x and pn equal to some region which is contained in pn−1 and such
that |pn| ≤1/n. Also, the existence of a ﬁnite limit in (†) stems from
the fact that the sequence ⟨δ(pn, qn)⟩n∈N is order-preserving and:
δ(pn, qn) ⩽δ(pn, p1) + δ(p1, q1) + δ(q1, qn) + |p1| + |q1|
= δ(p1, q1) + |p1| + |q1| .
It remains to prove (d1), (d2) and (d3). Now, (d1) and (d2) are evident.
To prove (d3) we observe that for any abstraction processes ⟨pn⟩n∈N,
⟨qn⟩n∈N, and ⟨rn⟩n∈N:
d(⟨pn⟩n∈N , ⟨qn⟩n∈N)
= lim
n→∞δ(pn, qn) ⩽lim
n→∞δ(pn, rn) + δ(rn, qn) + |rn|
= lim
n→∞δ(pn, rn) + lim
n→∞δ(rn, qn) + lim
n→∞|rn|
= d(⟨pn⟩n∈N , ⟨rn⟩n∈N) + d(⟨rn⟩n∈N , ⟨qn⟩n∈N).

Definition 12. By a metric space associated with (R, ≤, δ, |·|) we under-
stand the quotient (AP, d) of (AP, d). By a point we mean every element
in AP.
Then a point of (R, ≤, δ, |·|) is a complete equivalence class
⟨pn⟩n∈N

and the distance between two points is deﬁned by (‡).
We are now ready to transform the metrical approach to point-free
geometry furnished by the ppm-spaces into a multi-valued approach.
Definition 13. Consider a language with three predicate symbols ‘≤’,
‘Close’, and ‘Small’. Then we call a point-free theory based on closeness
and smallness (in brief c-s-theory) the following theory:
(O)
Order(≤)
(S1)
∀x∀y(x ≤y ∧Small(y) ⇒Small(x))
(S2)
∀x∃z(z ≤x ∧Small(z))
(C1)
∀x∀y(x ≤y ∧Close(x, z) ⇒Close(y, z)))
(C2)
∀x Close(x, x)
(C3)
∀x∀y(Close(x, y) ⇒Close(y, x))
(C4)
∀x∀y∀z(Close(x, z) ∧Close(z, y) ∧Small(z) ⇒Close(x, y))
We call a c-s-structure a model of this theory.
Notice that (C4) claims that ‘Close’ is a transitive relation as long
as we consider only small regions. In [13] this system of axioms is used
to give a solution of Poincaré’s paradox of indiscernibility.
A c-s-structure is a quadruple (R, ≤, close, small) such that ≤is an
order relation, close is order-preserving, small is order-reversing and:
•
close(x, x) = 1,
•
close(x, y) = close(x, y),
•
(close(x, z) ⊗close(z, y)) ⊗small(z) ⩽close(x, y)1,
•
for every x ∈R and n ∈N there is z ≤x such that small(z) ⩾1−1
n.
Theorem 2. Let ⊗be any Archimedean t-norm.
Then every c-s-
structure is associated with some ppm-space.
Proof. Let f : [0, 1] →[0, ∞] be an additive generator of ⊗and deﬁne
δ and |·| by setting:
δ(x, y) := f(close(x, y)) and |x| := f(small(x)).
1 Recall that ⊗is a continuous t-norm (see Deﬁnition 1).

546
Cristina Coppola and Giangiacomo Gerla
Then it is evident that δ is order-reversing, |·| is order-preserving, and
that (ppm1) and (ppm2) are satisﬁed. To prove (ppm3), we observe that,
applying (⊗) to (C4):
f [−1][f(f [−1](f(close(x, z) + f(close(z, y)))) +
f(small(z))] ⩽close(x, y). So: f(f [−1](f(close(x, z) + f(close(z, y)))) +
f(small(z)) ⩾f(close(x, y)), i.e.:
f(f [−1](δ(x, z) + δ(z, y))) + |z| ⩾
δ(x, y). Thus, by Proposition 2(vii), we obtain (ppm3).
Finally, to prove (ppm4), we observe that given x ∈R, by (S2),
sup{small(r) : r ≤x} = 1. Since f [−1]( 1
n) < f [−1](0) = 1, we have
that for every n ∈N there is r ≤x such that small(r) ≥f [−1]( 1
n) and
therefore such that |rn| ⩽f(f [−1]( 1
n)) ⩽1
n.
Corollary 1. Let ⊗be any Archimedean t-norm.
Then every c-s-
structure is associated with some metric space.
Proof. It is suﬃcient to associate the c-s-structure with the related
ppm-space and such ppm-space with the related metric space.
In light of this, in a metric space associated with a c-s-structure (R, ≤,
close, small), a point is a complete equivalence class deﬁned by an order-
reversing sequence ⟨xn⟩n∈N of regions such that limn→∞small(xn) = 1.
The distance between two points
⟨xn⟩n∈N
 and
⟨yn⟩n∈N
 is deﬁned by
setting d(
⟨xn⟩n∈N
 ,
⟨yn⟩n∈N
) = f(limn→∞close(xn, yn)).
6. Point-free geometry based on smallness
In the literature there are also metric approaches to point-free geometry
based only on the notion of diameter (see e.g. [22, 23, 1, 16]). In this
section we consider the system proposed in [16] where in a partially
ordered set we deﬁne the overlapping relation O by setting xOy iﬀthere
is an element z which is not the minimum and such that z ≤x and z ≤y.
Definition 14. A diametric poset is a structure (R, ≤, |·|), where (R, ≤)
is a poset without a minimum and the |·| : R →[0, ∞] is an order-
preserving diameter function such that:
(D1) xOy entails that there is r such that x ≤r, y ≤r and |r| ≤|x|+|y|,
(D2) for each x and y there is a bounded region z such that zOx and
zOy,
(D3) given x, for every n > 0 there is z ≤x such that |z| ≤1
n.
As in Section 3, we call regions elements of R; inclusion the relation ≤.

The property expressed by (D1) extends to a ﬁnite number of regions.
Proposition 5. If a1, a2, . . . , an are regions such that a1Oa2, . . . ,
an−1Oan, then there is a region r including all a1, . . . , an and such that
|r| ⩽|a1| + · · · + |an| .
Proof. We prove this proposition by induction on n. In the case n = 1
it is suﬃcient to put r = a1.
Assume n > 1 and that a1Oa2, . . . ,
an−1Oan. Then by the induction hypothesis there is an rn such that:
a1 ⩽rn, . . . , an−1 ⩽rn and |rn| ⩽|a1| + · · · + |an−1| .
Since an−1 ⩽rn entails rnOan, by (D1), an upper bound r of both rn
and an exists such that |r| ⩽|rn| + |an|. Hence r is an upper bound of
a1, . . . , an such that |r| ⩽|a1| + · · · + |an|.
We now deﬁne a notion of lower distance between two regions x and y
which is based on the idea of the length of a “bridge” z between x and y.
Definition 15. We call a lower distance the function δ : R2 →[0, ∞)
deﬁned by:
δ(x, y) := inf{|z| : zOx and zOy} .
Theorem 3. Let (R, ≤, |·|) be any diametric poset. Then the structure
(R, ≤, δ, |·|) is a ppm-space. So, it is possible to associate every diametric
poset with a metric space.
Proof. To prove (ppm1) we observe that δ(x, x) ⩽inf{|z| : z ≤x} and
we apply (D3). To prove (ppm3), assume that x, y and z are regions.
Then if the diameter of z is inﬁnite (ppm3) is evident. Otherwise, let
u be a region such that uOx, uOz and v be a region such that vOz and
vOy. Since uOz and vOz, a region r exists such that r ≥u, r ≥v
and r ≥z and |r| ⩽|u| + |v| + |z|. Since rOx and rOy, we have that
δ(x, y) ⩽|r| ⩽|u| + |v| + |z|. Thus, δ(x, y) ⩽inf{|u| : uOx, uOz} +
inf{|v| : vOz, vOy} + |z| = δ(x, z) + δ(z, y) + |z|.
It is evident that
δ assumes ﬁnite values and that δ is order-reversing.
The following ﬁrst-order theory is obtained by adding a suitable ax-
iom to the axioms concerning ≤and Small in Deﬁnition 13.
Definition 16. Consider a ﬁrst-order language with the predicate sym-
bols ‘≤’ and ‘Small’. Then a point-free theory based on smallness (in
brief: s-theory) is the theory whose axioms are (O), (S1), (S2), and:

548
Cristina Coppola and Giangiacomo Gerla
(S3) xOy ⇒∃r(x ≤r ∧y ≤r ∧Ct(Small(x) ∧Small(y) ⇒Small(r)))
By an s-structure we mean a model of this theory.
Theorem 4. If ⊗is an Archimedean t-norm, then every s-structure is
associated with a diametric poset and therefore with a metric space.
Proof. Let (R, ≤, ) be an s-structure and f be a continuous generator of
⊗. If we put |x| := f(small(x)), then |·| is an order-preserving function.
To prove that |·| satisﬁes (D1) assume that xOy. Then, by (S3), the
formula ∃r(x ≤r∧y ≤r∧Ct(Small(x)∧Small(y) ⇒Small(r))) assumes
the value 1 and therefore, given x and y in R:
sup{ct(small(x) ⊗small(y) →small(r)) : x ≤r and y ≤r} = 1.
This entails that there is r such that r ≥x and r ≥y and small(x) ⊗
small(y) ≤small(r), i.e., f [−1](f(small(x)) + f(small(y))) ⩽small(r).
Consequently: f(f [−1](f(small(x)) + f(small(y)))) ⩾f(small(r)), and
therefore: |x|+|y| = f(small(x))+f(small(y)) ⩾f(small(y)) = |r|.
7. Point-free geometry by graded inclusions (fuzzy mereology)
Another possible metric approach to point-free geometry is obtained by
considering a graded inclusion between regions. In this case we refer
to quasi-metrics, i.e.
“distances” in which the symmetric property is
not required (see [10]). The prototypical example is furnished by the
excess measure of a subset x with respect to a subset y, upon which the
deﬁnition of the famous Hausdorﬀdistance is founded.
Definition 17. Given a metric space (S, d), the excess measure is the
function ed : P(S) × P(S) →[0, ∞] deﬁned, for every pair x and y of
non-empty subsets of S, by setting
ed(x, y) := sup{d(P, y) : P ∈x}
where, in turn, d(P, y) is the distance of the point P from the subset y
deﬁned by setting
d(P, y) := inf{d(P, Q) : Q ∈y}.
Since the elements of Re are bounded, in the prototypical model the
value ed(x, y) is ﬁnite. It is immediate to see that ed is not symmetric,

Mereological foundations of point-free geometry . . .

that ed(x, x) = 0 and that the triangle inequality holds. This suggests
reference to the following class of structures.
Definition 18. A quasi-metric space is a structure (R, δ) such that R
is a non-empty set and δ: R × R →[0, ∞) is a mapping such that, for
all x, y, z ∈R:
δ(x, x) = 0
(d1)
δ(x, y) ≤δ(x, z) + δ(z, y) .
(d3)
Then quasi-metric space theory is obtained from metric space theory
by leaving out the symmetry of δ and the axiom claiming that δ(x, y) = 0
entails x = y. Every quasi-metric space is associated with a pre-order in
the following way.
Proposition 6. Let (R, δ) be a quasi-metric space, then the relation ≤
deﬁned by setting:
x ≤y
df
⇐⇒δ(x, y) = 0
is a pre-order. Moreover, the diameter of any z ∈R is the number:
|z| = sup{δ(x, y) : x ≤z and y ≤z}.
In the prototypical model the associated pre-order is the usual set
theoretical inclusion and the diameter is the usual diameter. Observe
that for all x and y such that y ≤x we have |x| ⩾δ(x, y). This entails
that x is an atom if and only if |x| = 0. Indeed, if |x| = 0 then for any
y, if y ≤x, then δ(x, y) = 0 since, by deﬁnition, δ(y, x) = 0. By (d2),
we have that y = x and this proves that x is an atom. Conversely, it is
evident that if x is an atom, then |x| = 0.
The following proposition emphasizes the fact that, diﬀerently from
the case of the ppm-spaces, δ is not order-reversing.
Proposition 7. The function δ in a quasi-metric space (R, δ) is order-
preserving with respect to the ﬁrst variable and order-reversing with
respect to the second variable. Also, the diameter |·| : R →[0, ∞] is
order-preserving.
We are ready to give the following basic deﬁnition where, given a real
number r, ∥r∥denotes the absolute value of r.
Definition 19. A quasi-metric space of regions is a quasi-metric space
(R, δ) satisfying the following axioms for all x, y ∈R:
(d3) ∥δ(x, y) −δ(y, x)∥≤|x| + |y|,
(d4) (∀n ∈N)(∃z ≤x) |z| ≤1
n.

550
Cristina Coppola and Giangiacomo Gerla
Axiom (d3) says that if we conﬁne ourselves to the class of “small”
regions, then the map δ is approximately symmetric and therefore is
a metric (approximately). In any quasi-metric space of regions we can
deﬁne (AP, d) and (AP, d) as in the previous cases and we can prove the
following theorem.
Theorem 5. Let (R, δ) be a quasi-metric space of regions. Then (AP, d)
is a pseudo-metric space and therefore (AP, d) is a metric space.
Proof. We observe only that, since δ(pn, qn) ⩽δ(qn, pn) + |pn| + |qn|,
d(⟨pn⟩n∈N , ⟨qn⟩n∈N) ⩽lim
n→∞δ(qn, pn) + lim
n→∞|pn| + lim
n→∞|qn|
= lim
n→∞δ(qn, pn) = d(⟨qn⟩n∈N , ⟨pn⟩n∈N).
In order to transform this metrical approach into a multi-valued
approach, let us consider a ﬁrst-order language with a binary relation
symbol ‘Incl’ whose intended interpretation is a graded inclusion. An
interpretation of such a language is deﬁned by a pair (R, incl) where R
is a non-empty set and incl : R × R →[0, 1] is a fuzzy binary relation.
We write ‘x ≤y’ to denote the formula ‘Ct(Incl(x, y))’ and ‘Eq(x, y)’ to
denote the formula ‘Incl(x, y)∧Incl(y, x)’. The intended meaning is that
‘≤’ is the ordinary inclusion and ‘Eq’ a graded equality. Also, we denote
by ‘Pl(x)’ the formula ∀z(z ≤x →Eq(x, z)). This formula represents
the graded version of the Euclidean deﬁnition of a point as a geometric
element which has no part, i.e., an element x such that x′ ≤x entails
x′ = x. So, if x satisﬁes ‘Pl(x)’ we say also that x is a point-like region.
Definition 20. By a point-free theory based on a graded inclusion we
mean the following system of axioms
(A1)
∀x(Incl(x, x))
(A2)
∀x∀y∀z(Incl(x, z) ∧Incl(z, y) ⇒Incl(x, y))
(A3)
∀x∀y(Pl(x) ∧Pl(y) ∧Incl(x, y) ⇒Incl(y, x))
(A4)
∀x∃z(z ≤x ∧Pl(z))
We call a graded inclusion space every model of (A1)–(A4).
Axioms (A1) and (A2) say that ‘Incl’ is a graded pre-order, (A3) says
that this pre-order is symmetric for point-like regions and therefore that
‘Incl’ is a graded equivalence in the class of these regions.

Mereological foundations of point-free geometry . . .

Theorem 6. Let (R, incl) be any model of the point-free theory based
on a graded inclusion. Then the model is associated with a quasi-metric
space of regions and therefore with a metric space.
Proof. Let f be a continuous generator of the triangular norm ⊗and
deﬁne δ by setting:
δ(x, y) := f(incl(x, y)).
Then it is evident that (R, δ) satisﬁes (d1). Moreover, in accordance with
(A2), incl(x, z)⊗incl(z, y) ⩽incl(x, y) and therefore f [−1](f(incl(x, z))+
f(incl(z, y))) ⩽incl(x, y). Since f is order-reversing, so f(incl(x, z)) +
f(incl(z, y))) ⩾f(f [−1](f(incl(x, z))+f(incl(z, y)))) ⩾f(incl(x, y)), by
Proposition 2(vii). Thus, δ satisﬁes (d2).
To prove that δ satisﬁes (d3), ﬁrst observe that:
f(pl(x)) = f(inf{incl(x, z) : z ≤x}) = sup{f(incl(x, y) : z ≤x}
= sup{δ(x, y) : z ≤x} = |x| .
Moreover, in the case δ(y, x) ⩾δ(x, y), i.e. f(incl(y, x)) ⩾f(incl(x, y)),
since f(incl(y, x)) −f(incl(x, y)) ⩽f(incl(y, x)) ⩽f(0), we have:
f(f [−1](f(incl(y, x)) −f(incl(x, y))) = f(incl(y, x)) −f(incl(x, y)).
Now, in accordance with (A3), we have:
pl(x) ⊗pl(y) ⩽(incl(x, y) →incl(y, x))
and therefore:
f [−1](f(pl(x)) + f(pl(y))) ⩽f [−1](f(incl(y, x)) −f(incl(x, y))).
By applying f to both the sides of this inequality, we obtain:
f(f [−1](f(pl(x)) + f(pl(y)))) ⩾f(f [−1](f(incl(y, x)) −f(incl(x, y))))
= f(incl(y, x)) −f(incl(x, y)).
Thus, this proves (d3):
|x| + |y| = f(pl(x)) + f(pl(y))) ⩾f(f [−1](f(pl(x)) + f(pl(y))))
⩾∥f(incl(y, x)) −f(incl(x, y))∥.
Finally, to prove (d4) observe that, by (A4), for every x we have
sup{pl(z) : z ≤x} = 1. So inf{f(pl(z)) : z ≤x} = f(sup{pl(z) : z ≤x})
= f(1) = 0.
