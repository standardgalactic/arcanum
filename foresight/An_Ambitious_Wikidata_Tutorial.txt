Wikidata is a free knowledge base that can be 
read and edited by 
humans and machines.

 
 
Wikidata's goals
●Centralize interwiki links
●Centralize infoboxes
●Provide an interface for rich queries
●Structure the sum of all human knowledge

 
 
What you'll learn from this talk
●How to edit Wikidata
●Projects built with Wikidata
●Wikidata API programming
● Ontologies
●Wikidata vocabulary
●Where to find things
●Querying with SPARQL, etc.
●RDF and OWL exports

 
 
Elements of a Wikidata statement

 
 
Example: Washington, D.C. (Q61)

 
 
Items and properties
● Each item and property has its own page
● Items
– Represent subjects: Barbara McClintock, Challenger disaster
– Have identifiers like Q199654, Q921090
– 14,875,838 items as of 2015-10-05
● Properties
– Represent attribute names: occupation, cause of
– Have identifiers like P106, P828
– 1,805 properties as of 2015-10-05

 
 
Statements and claims
●
Claims
–
 Claims are “triplets”
● Formally: subject, predicate, object
● In Wikidata: item, property, value 
● Example: Barbara McClintock, occupation, scientist
●
Statements
–
 A claim is only part of a statement
–
 Statements also include:
● References
● Ranks

 
 
Qualifiers, ranks, references
●Qualifiers
– Qualifiers are properties used on claims rather than items
– “Bethesda population 56,527 point in time (P585) 1960”
●Ranks
– Preferred, normal, deprecated
– Useful to mark outdated claims
●References
– Source of claim; provenance
– “... stated in (P248) 1960 United States Census”

Getting to Wikidata from Wikipedia

 
 
Instant search suggests items that have labels or 
aliases matching your keyword.
Wikidata search

 
 
Search by label

 
 
Search by alias: “flu” -> influenza

 
 
Finding properties
●Is there a property for “number of windows”?
●What was the ID of that property, again?
●Search
– In main site search box, prefix search term with “P:”
– “P:number of”, “P:occupation”
– Instant search doesn't work for properties, only items
●Browse

Area?  Height? GDP per capita?
●Quantities with units recently made possible!
●area (P2046)
●height (P2048)
●mass (P2067)
●cost (P2130)
●GDP per capita (P2132)
●total debt (P2133)

 
 
Quantities: Lots of low-hanging fruit
●Not yet on Wikidata:
– Area of Washington, D.C.
– Height of Abraham Lincoln 
– Height of United States Capitol 
– Length of Mississippi River
– GDP per capita of the United States of America
^ Add these!

Querying in Wikidata
List of politicians who died of cancer
Pseudo-query:
occupation: politician AND cause of death: cancer
occupation: P106
politician: Q82955
cause of death: P509
cancer: Q12078
Wikidata query in Autolist: 
claim[106:82955] AND claim[509:12078]

 
 
http://tools.wmflabs.org/autolist/autolist1.html?q=claim[106:82955]%20AND%20claim[509:12078]

 
 
Only 56 politicians have died of cancer?
Seems rather low...

 
 
Classification on Wikidata
●Taxonomy of knowledge
●Enables powerful inference, novel applications
●Interesting philosophical, design, and engineering issues

 
 

 
 
Tree of Porphyry

Classes and instances
●Plato is a human is a animal
●Plato instance of human subclass of animal
●Instance: concrete object, individual
●Class: abstract object

 
 
Classification on Wikidata
●instance of (P31)
– rdf:type in RDF and OWL
– Most popular Wikidata property
●subclass of (P279)
– “all instances of A are also instances of B”
– rdfs:subClassOf in RDF and OWL

 
 
Examples
●USS Nimitz instance of Nimitz-class aircraft carrier
Nimitz-class aircraft carrier subclass of aircraft carrier
●2012 Cannes Film Festival instance of Cannes Film Festival
Cannes Film Festival subclass of film festival
●an individual charm quark instance of charm quark 
charm quark subclass of quark
^ Many “leaf nodes” in Wikidata's taxonomic hierarchy are not instances.
   (There are no items about individual quarks on Wikidata!)
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Basic_membership_properties

 
 
Bad smells
Item has many instance of or subclass of claims
Items typically satisfy a huge number of instance of claims:
●Fido instance of dog
●Fido instance of English Pointer  
●Fido instance of faithful animal
●…
Solution: use one class for instance of, put other class knowledge into 
normal properties
●Fido instance of dog
●Fido breed: English Pointer
●Fido known for: faithfulness
●...

 
 
Bad smells
subclass of claim that is nonsensical when interpreted as “All instances of A 
are also instances of B”
Example:
dog subclass of pet
But not all dogs are pets!  
feral dog subclass of dog      true
feral dog subclass of pet      false
:. dog subclass of pet      false
Solution: put “pet” knowledge about dogs into claim that does not apply to all 
instances of dog.  E.g. “dog has role pet”.  (Has role would not be transitive.)

 
 
Classification on Wikidata
●Last but not least: part of (P361)
– Third basic membership property
– Top-level “part-whole” relation
●subclass of and part of are both transitive; instance of is not transitive
●Transitive relation: 
A subclass of B
B subclass of C
:. A subclass of C

subclass of (P279) 
enables machines to infer 
conceptual hierarchy

 
 
Recall 
Query reports that only 56 politicians have died of cancer
Problem
Only matches the precise claim “cause of death: cancer” 
Omits results that have:
– cause of death: lung cancer
– cause of death: lymphoma
– cause of death: leukemia
Solution
Include causes of death that are a subclass of cancer
– In Autolist: http://tinyurl.com/ovgjqd8
– Also possible in SPARQL in new Wikidata Query Service

 
 
SPARQL 
●SPARQL: semantic query language for databases
●Wikidata recently added official support
– Query UI: https://query.wikidata.org
– Examples: 
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/Indexing
/SPARQL_Query_Examples

PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>
SELECT ?politician ?cause ?politician_label ?cause_of_death_label WHERE {
   ?politician wdt:P106 wd:Q82955 .    # find items that have "occupation (P106): politician (Q82955)"
   ?politician wdt:P509 ?cause .            # with a P509 (cause of death) claim
   ?cause wdt:P279* wd:Q12078 .        # ... where the cause is a subclass of (P279*) cancer (Q12078)
   # ?politician wdt:P39 wd:Q11696 .   # Uncomment this line to include only U.S. Presidents
  
   OPTIONAL {?politician rdfs:label ?politician_label filter (lang(?politician_label) = "en") .} 
   OPTIONAL {?cause rdfs:label ?cause_of_death_label filter (lang(?cause_of_death_label) = "en").}

Causation on Wikidata
●https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Modeling_causes
●has cause (P828) (alias underlying cause): thing that ultimately resulted in 
the effect
●has immediate cause (P1478): thing that proximately resulted in the effect
●has contributing factor (P1479): thing that significantly influenced the 
effect, but did not directly cause it

 
 
American Civil War (Q8676)
