I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Mike Duﬀfor being a great
inspiration and an ideal collaborator, and for teaching me so much about physics
and how it is done. Next, I thank Alexandros Anastasiou, Leron Borsten, Silvia
Nagy and Alessio Marrani, who have been a fantastic team to work with through-
out my PhD. I also want to thank all my fellow students, as well as those co-workers

their kind understanding of my idiosyncrasies.
I am hugely grateful to my family, and in particular to my parents, for their support,
encouragement and for listening to my attempts to explain my work on so many
occasions. Last but certainly not least, I cannot thank my partner Laura Bethke
enough for her limitless support and patience during the more diﬃcult periods in
these last few years; it is hard for me to imagine such times without her ability to
bring joy and positivity to any set of circumstances.

Abstract
This thesis makes manifest the roles of the normed division algebras R, C, H and
O in various supergravity theories. Of particular importance are the octonions O,
which frequently occur in connection with maximal supersymmetry, and hence also
in the context of string and M-theory.
Studying the symmetries of M-theory is
perhaps the most straightforward route towards understanding its nature, and the
division algebras provide useful tools for such study via their deep relationship with
Lie groups.
After reviews of supergravity and the deﬁnitions and properties of R, C, H and
O, a division-algebraic formulation of pure super Yang-Mills theories is developed.
In any spacetime dimension a Yang-Mills theory with Q real supercharge compo-
nents is written over the division algebra with dimension Q/2. In particular then,
maximal Q = 16 super Yang-Mills theories are written over the octonions, since
O is eight-dimensional. In such maximally supersymmetric theories, the failure of
the supersymmetry algebra to close oﬀ-shell (using the conventional auxiliary ﬁeld
formalism) is shown to correspond to the non-associativity of the octonions.
Making contact with the idea of ‘gravity as the square of gauge theory’, these
division-algebraic Yang-Mills multiplets are then tensored together in each spacetime
dimension to produce a pyramid of supergravity theories, with the Type II theories
at the apex in ten dimensions. The supergravities at the base of the pyramid have
global symmetry groups that ﬁll out the famous Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits magic
square. This magic square algebra is generalised to a ‘magic pyramid algebra’, which
describes the global symmetries of each Yang-Mills-squared theory in the pyramid.
Finally, a formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity over the octonions is
presented.
Toroidally compactifying this version of the theory to four or three
spacetime dimensions leads to an interpretation of the dilaton vectors (which or-
ganise the coupling of the seven or eight dilatons to the other bosonic ﬁelds) as the
octavian integers – the octonionic analogue of the integers.

1. Introduction
1.1. Supergravity, Superstrings and M-Theory
The goal of high energy physics is arguably to determine the fundamental micro-
scopic constituents of the universe and the basic rules that govern their interactions.
For most theorists, the hope is that there are simple, logical organising principles
underlying the structure of these elementary building blocks, which might allow us
to paint an essentially complete picture of their properties and behaviour in the
form of one or two short equations – a ‘theory of everything’.
Quantum ﬁeld theory and the Standard Model of particle physics have given
us a powerful description of this microscopic world, bringing into focus the realm
of quarks, leptons and gauge bosons, the ingredients required to explain all non-
gravitational phenomena observed so far. To incorporate gravity into this quantum
picture requires a marriage between the Standard Model and Einstein’s theory of
general relativity, which stipulates that at the macroscopic scale gravity is the man-
ifestation of the smooth curvature of spacetime. However, the basic frameworks of
quantum ﬁeld theory and general relativity are infamously incompatible; unlike the
ﬁeld theories describing electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces,
general relativity is not renormalisable, and hence any naive attempt to calculate
graviton scattering amplitudes (beyond one loop [2, 3]) is thwarted by untameable
divergences.
In the early 1980s many physicists believed that a candidate ‘theory of everything’
was Cremmer and Julia’s theory of eleven-dimensional supergravity [4, 5].
The
vital ingredient in this theory, and a protagonist in this thesis, is supersymmetry, a
symmetry which unites fermions and bosons. Intriguingly, supersymmetry requires
the existence of Einstein’s gravity [6], as well as placing an upper limit [7] of eleven
on the number of spacetime dimensions D.
The ultraviolet (UV) behaviour of
supersymmetric quantum ﬁeld theories also tends to be good [8], due to cancellations
between divergences coming from bosons and divergences coming (with the opposite
sign) from fermions, so it was hoped that this might render D = 11 supergravity
renormalisable.
13

Far from being a disadvantage, the seven extra dimensions of the theory are a
potentially great asset, thanks to the techniques of Kaluza-Klein reduction [9, 10,
11, 12, 13]. Supposing that the extra dimensions take the form of some compact
seven-manifold M7 of length scale L, then at scales much larger than L the low-
energy eﬀective theory is not only four-dimensional, but also turns out to have a
gauge symmetry: the isometry group [14] of M7. In other words, the existence
of extra dimensions might reveal the origin of the Standard Model’s mysterious
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) gauge symmetry, which serves as its (slightly ad hoc) or-
ganising principle; in the low-energy four-dimensional physics this symmetry would
be a remnant of the underlying higher-dimensional gravitational theory’s invariance
under general coordinate transformations.
One seemingly attractive feature of D = 11 supergravity came from Witten’s
discovery [14] that seven extra dimensions are the minimum required to produce
the Standard Model’s gauge group via Kaluza-Klein reduction. This means that a
world with eleven spacetime dimensions is singled out both from above and below,
by supersymmetry and the Kaluza-Klein theory of the Standard Model, respectively.
Is this a profound clue about nature, or just a strange coincidence? Or both? The
answer remains to be seen.
For a while, interest in eleven-dimensional supergravity faded as it appeared to be
non-renormalisable after all, and there were diﬃculties obtaining the chiral fermions
of the Standard Model by Kaluza-Klein reduction [14].
Moreover, by 1984 ten-
dimensional superstring theory was gaining popularity [15, 16, 17, 18] and seemed
promising as a uniﬁed and apparently UV-ﬁnite theory of all particles and interac-
tions, including quantum gravity. Its central idea is that at the Planck scale any
individual particle is a tiny one-dimensional (supersymmetric) string, and that the
particular quantum-mechanical vibrational mode of this string dictates its corre-
sponding particle type. It is in this sense that string theory’s description of particle
physics is unifying; each particle type is a diﬀerent manifestation of the same un-
derlying object. In particular, there is a vibrational mode with the properties of
a massless spin-2 particle, which may be identiﬁed with the graviton. Better yet,
quantum consistency of superstring theory demands that its low-energy ﬁeld theory
approximation is equivalent to general relativity – or rather to its supersymmetric
generalisation in ten spacetime dimensions.
Unlike the unique D = 11 supergravity theory, there are several (anomaly-free)
D = 10 supergravities, each of which is the low-energy description of one of ﬁve
distinct consistent string theories known as Type I, Heterotic SO(32), Heterotic
E8 × E8, Type IIA and Type IIB [15, 16, 17, 18].
The ﬁve string theories are
14

distinguished by fundamental assumptions regarding basic features of their strings,
such as whether the strings are oriented or unoriented, or whether they may be open
line segments or only closed loops. Remarkably in the 1990s it was discovered that
the ﬁve theories are connected to one another via a web of dualities, that is, they are
equivalent to one another upon taking various limits [19, 20, 21, 22]. For example the
Type I theory in the limit of strong coupling is equivalent to the Heterotic SO(32)
theory with weak coupling [19, 21], and vice versa. Because of this web of dualities,
the ﬁve string theories are now understood to be limiting cases of a single theory,
dubbed M-theory, which is yet to be properly deﬁned.
At its fundamental level M-theory is thought to include extended vibrating objects
of various dimensionalities called branes [22, 23]. Just as the D = 10 supergravity
ﬁeld theories correspond to the low-energy physics of strings, it is believed that the
low-energy physics of M-theory is described by none-other than D = 11 supergrav-
ity. For this reason, there is as much interest in supergravity in ten and eleven
dimensions today – and in supergravity more generally – as there was in the 1970s
and 1980s. These supersymmetric generalisations of Einstein’s theory are perhaps
the best handle we have on working towards an understanding of M-theory, as well
as its hoped eventual reduction to the Standard Model.
1.2. Octonions and Supergravity
Complex numbers, ubiquitous in modern physics, generalise the real line to the
complex plane. It is natural to ask whether this can be taken further; are there
higher-dimensional number systems whose mathematics may have some utility or
signiﬁcance in physical theories? In fact, there is a set of precisely four such number
systems, the so-called normed division algebras – the real numbers R, the complex
numbers C, the quaternions H and the octonions O – and they all have roles to play
in physics1.
A recurring theme in the study of supersymmetry and string theory is the con-
nection to these four special algebras. See, for example, references [24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. The octonions, titular in this thesis, are perhaps the most
intriguing and the most mysterious of these. Not only do they hold an exceptional
status as the largest division algebra, but they may be used to describe representa-
tions of the Lorentz group in spacetime dimensions D = 10, 11 – dimensions that are
1In fact, there is actually another useful series of algebras that generalise R, C and H: the Cliﬀord
algebras, Cl(N). They begin as Cl(0) ∼= R, Cl(1) ∼= C, Cl(2) ∼= H, but they depart from the
division algebras at Cl(3) ∼= H ⊕H and continue from there on to N →∞in terms of matrices
over R, C and H. These will be introduced in Chapter 4.
15

themselves distinguished as those preferred by string and M-theory, as well as be-
ing the maximum dimensions typically allowable for rigid and local supersymmetry,
respectively.
The aim of this thesis is to make manifest the roles of the four normed division al-
gebras R, C, H and O in various supergravity theories. The octonions will frequently
appear in connection with maximal supersymmetry, and hence also in the context
of string and M-theory. Studying the symmetries of these theories is perhaps the
most straightforward route towards understanding their nature, and the division
algebras provide natural building blocks for such study via their deep relationship
with Lie groups. In particular, as will be demonstrated in the chapters to come,
exceptional groups such as E8 are inherently octonionic in structure and often arise
as the symmetries of supergravities [4, 35], strings [36] and M-theory [37, 38].
After a brief review of supersymmetry and supergravity in Chapter 2, Chapter
3 will provide a detailed introduction to the normed division algebras and their
relationship with triality, a pivotal cog in the machinery of string theory [36, 39, 16].
Chapter 4 will build on a well-established description of minimally supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories in dimensions D = 3, 4, 6 and 10 in terms of R, C, H and O [24,
31], and by dimensional reduction extend this description to incorporate additional
supersymmetries and to include any spacetime dimension 3 ≤D ≤10. Maximally
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, which are descended from D = 10, are all
written over the octonions in this formalism.
Chapter 5 will introduce the idea of ‘gravity as the square of gauge theory’, and in
this spirit the division-algebraic Yang-Mills multiplets will be ‘multiplied’ together
to produce supergravity theories valued over tensor products of division algebras. In
D = 3 this leads to a set of supergravities whose global symmetry groups correspond
to a famous set of Lie algebras called the Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits magic square2,
which will also be introduced in Chapter 5.
In D = 3 there are four super Yang-Mills theories (N = 1, 2, 4, 8), while in D = 10
there is just one (N = 1); hence ‘squaring Yang-Mills’ in the range 3 ≤D ≤10 leads
to a pyramid of supergravity theories, which will be the subject of Chapter 6. Type
II supergravity sits at the apex in D = 10, while the magic square supergravities
populate the 4 × 4 base of the pyramid in D = 3. The magic square algebra of
Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits will be generalised to a ‘magic pyramid algebra’, which
describes the global symmetries of each Yang-Mills-squared theory.
Finally, in Chapter 7, a formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity over the
2Note that the magic square has appeared before in supergravity in an almost entirely diﬀerent
context [25, 26], with each of its four rows in a diﬀerent dimension D = 3, 4, 5, 6 (and with
diﬀerent real forms of its Lie algebras).
16

octonions will be presented. Toroidally compactifying this version of the theory to
four or three spacetime dimensions leads to an eﬀective Lagrangian written in terms
of the octavian integers [40, 41] – the octonionic analogue of the integers.
1.3. Conventions and Units
All physics in this thesis will be expressed in natural units, with c = ℏ= G = 1. The
metric will have ‘mostly plus’ signature (−, +, +, · · · , +) in any number of spacetime
dimensions D.
When dealing with decompositions of Lie algebras, the direct sum symbol ⊕will
be reserved to sit between commuting Lie subalgebras, while + will denote the direct
sum for subspaces that do not commute with these subalgebras – for example,
so(m + n) ∼= so(m) ⊕so(n) + Rm ⊗Rn.
(1.1)
Similarly, the symbol ⊖between two commuting Lie algebras will denote ‘direct
subtraction’, e.g.
u(n) ⊖u(1) ∼= su(n),
(1.2)
while the symbol −will denote the removal of a subspace that does not commute
with the rest of the algebra, as in
so(m + n) −Rm ⊗Rn ∼= so(m) ⊕so(n).
(1.3)
Also note that direct sums and direct products of vector spaces will be used inter-
changeably wherever such operations are essentially indistinguishable – for example
R2 ∼= R ⊕R.

2. A Review of Supersymmetry
and Supergravity
This chapter reviews the basic ideas and features of supersymmetric theories, mostly
at the classical level.
Although the quantum properties of supersymmetric ﬁeld
theories make up a rich subject, they will mostly be beyond the scope of this thesis,
whose focus is at the level of Lagrangians and their symmetries.
The ﬁrst section is an illustration of the basic features of a theory with a global
supersymmetry by means of a simple ‘toy’ model, roughly following the exposition
in [42]. Then comes a brief introduction to super Yang-Mills theory, followed by a
review of supergravity and the all-important eleven-dimensional theory. The ﬁnal
two sections will demonstrate the techniques of Kaluza-Klein reduction on a torus
T d and examine the symmetries of the resulting lower-dimensional theories.
2.1. The Basics of Rigid Supersymmetry
Consider the simple theory of a free scalar ﬁeld φ and Dirac spinor ﬁeld ψ, both of
mass m:
S =
Z
d4x
 −1
2∂µφ∂µφ −i ¯ψγµ∂µψ −1
2m2φ2 + im ¯ψψ

.
(2.1)
The Lagrangian is invariant – up to a total derivative – under the following trans-
formations [8]:
δφ = i¯ϵψ,
δψ = 1
2(γµ∂µ + m)φϵ,
(2.2)
where ϵ is some constant spinor parameter. This is called a supersymmetry. The
transformations ‘rotate’ a bosonic ﬁeld into a fermionic one, and vice versa.
In
general the set of ﬁelds rotated into one another by supersymmetry transformations
is called a supermultiplet – in this case this is just the pair {φ, ψ}.
Thanks to
Noether’s theorem, this symmetry implies the existence of a conserved current
J µ = (γν∂νφ −mφ)γµψ.
(2.3)
18

Note that this supercurrent is a vector-spinor quantity. There is also a corresponding
conserved spinor supercharge, which can be expressed in the usual form:
Q =
Z
d3x J 0(x, t).
(2.4)
The total number of supercharges – equal to the number of independent super-
symmetries – is usually denoted by N. The theory above has N = 1 since there
is just one set of transformations and one corresponding spinor supercharge. The
supercharge generates the supersymmetry transformations via Poisson brackets,
δφ = [¯ϵQ, φ]PB = i¯ϵψ,
δψ = [¯ϵQ, ψ]PB = 1
2(γµ∂µ + m)φϵ,
(2.5)
where the Poisson bracket between any two functions F and G of the ﬁelds and their
conjugate momenta is deﬁned as
[F, G]PB :=
Z
dD−1⃗x

δF
δΦi(⃗x)
δG
δΠi(⃗x) −
δF
δΠi(⃗x)
δG
δΦi(⃗x)

,
(2.6)
where the sum i runs over all ﬁelds Φi in a given theory and their momenta Πi.
Of course, to see any interesting physics one must consider an interacting ﬁeld
theory, such as that introduced in the following section.
2.2. Super Yang-Mills Theory
Super Yang-Mills theory (SYM) is, as the name suggests, the supersymmetric gen-
eralisation of pure Yang-Mills theory. As such, the four-dimensional N = 1 theory
contains a massless gauge boson AA
µ, where the index A = 1, · · · , dim[G] labels the
adjoint representation of some simple, compact, non-Abelian gauge group G. Its
‘superpartner’ is a massless Majorana spinor λA sometimes called a ‘gaugino’. The
action is
S =
Z

(2.7)
with the covariant derivative and ﬁeld strength given by the usual expressions

AAB
µ λC,
F A
µν = ∂µAA
ν −∂νAA
µ + gfBC

(2.8)
Again up to a total derivative, the Lagrangian is invariant under the supersymmetry
transformations

µ = −i

where in general the matrix γµ1µ2...µr is deﬁned as the antisymmetrised product of r
gamma matrices
γµ1µ2...µr := γ[µ1γµ2 . . . γµr]
(2.10)
and is called the rank-r Cliﬀord algebra element. A very important term of the form
fBCA  ¯λBγνλC  ¯ϵγνλA
arises in the variation of the Lagrangian, which vanishes by
virtue of a special spinor identity [15] that holds only in dimensions D = 3, 4, 6, 10.
A proof of this will be given in Chapter 4.
The fact that a super Yang-Mills theory with supermultiplet {Aµ, λ} exists only
in these particular dimensions can be understood by counting the on-shell degrees
of freedom of the ﬁelds; it is a basic requirement for a non-trivial supersymmetric
theory that the numbers of bosonic and fermionic on-shell degrees of freedom are
equal – see Section 2.4. In D dimensions a vector ﬁeld carries D −2 on-shell degrees
of freedom, which matches that of a single spinor only when D −2 = 1, 2, 4, 8, since
the number of degrees of freedom for a spinor is always a power of 2.
This is a ﬁrst hint that the division algebras R, C, H, O might be related to super-
symmetry; the number of bosonic (fermionic) on-shell degrees of freedom in SYM
can be either 1, 2, 4 or 8 – precisely the dimensions of R, C, H and O. This is indeed
no coincidence, as will be demonstrated in Chapter 4.
2.3. Supersymmetry Algebras
It is instructive to consider the commutator of two successive supersymmetry trans-
formations with independent parameters ϵ1 and ϵ2. In the case of the SYM example
above, a straightforward calculation using the supersymmetry transformations gives
δ1(δ2AA
µ) −δ2(δ1AA
µ) = −i
2(¯ϵ1γνϵ2)F A
νµ,
δ1(δ2λA) −δ2(δ1λA) = −i
2(¯ϵ1γµϵ2)DµλA +
  i
2(¯ϵ2γµDµλA)ϵ1 −(1 ↔2)

,
(2.11)
which, on substitution of the fermionic equation of motion γµDµλA = 0, becomes
simply:
[δ1, δ2]AA
µ = aνF A
νµ,
[δ1, δ2]λA = aµDµλA,
with
aµ := −i
2¯ϵ1γµϵ2.
(2.12)
The commutator of the two supersymmetry transformations is thus a translation
– in this case a gauge-covariant one. That a supersymmetry transformation is the
‘square root of a translation’ demonstrates the crucial point that supersymmetry is
to be regarded as a spacetime symmetry rather than an internal one. This can also
20

be seen from the fact is that the associated conserved charge is a spinor, and hence
transforms non-trivially under the Lorentz group, meaning supersymmetry does not
commute with Lorentz transformations.
Using equation (2.5) one can write the transformations in terms of Poisson brack-
ets with the supercharge Q:
[δ1, δ2]AA
µ =

¯ϵ1Q, [¯ϵ2Q, AA
µ]PB

PB −(1 ↔2)
=

[¯ϵ1Q, ¯ϵ2Q]PB, AA
µ

PB .
(2.13)
However, this gives a translation by aµ, which can be written as

[¯ϵ1Q, ¯ϵ2Q]PB, AA
µ

PB = −i
2¯ϵ1γνϵ2 [Pν, AA
µ]PB,
(2.14)
where the momentum Pµ is the conserved charge associated with translational sym-
metry, obtained from the energy-momentum tensor Tµν:
Pµ =
Z
d3x Tµ0.
(2.15)
In fact, equation (2.14) holds not just for AA
µ, but for any ﬁeld in a supersymmetric
theory; thus in general
[¯ϵ1Q, ¯ϵ2Q]PB = −i
2¯ϵ1γνϵ2 Pν.
(2.16)
Then, since ϵ1 and ϵ2 are arbitrary, one can strip them from this equation (making
use of the anti-commutativity of fermionic quantities) and conclude that:
{Qα, ¯Qβ}PB = −i
2(γµ)α
βPµ,
(2.17)
where α, β are spinor indices and curly braces denote the Poisson bracket of two
fermionic quantities. Equation (2.17) expresses the relationship between supersym-
metry and translations – the former as the ‘square root’ of the latter – at the level
of classical conserved charges. Similarly one can show that
{Qα, Qβ}PB = 0,
[Qα, Pµ]PB = 0,
(2.18)
and since Qα transforms as a spinor under Lorentz transformations, its Poisson
bracket with the associated conserved charge Jµν, the angular momentum tensor, is
given by
[Qα, Jµν]PB = −i
2(γµν)α
βQβ.
(2.19)
Along with the usual brackets between Pµ and Jµν, equations (2.17), (2.18) and
21

(2.19) make up the classical N = 1 super-Poincar´e algebra in terms of conserved
charges. When the theory is quantised, the ﬁelds – and hence also the conserved
charges – become operators acting on a Fock space. The charge operators act as
generators for the symmetries to which they each correspond via Noether’s theorem,
and their Poisson brackets usually become algebraic commutators: [·, ·]PB →−i[·, ·].
However, because the supersymmetry generators Qα are anti-commuting spinor
quantities, the [Q, Q] Poisson brackets become anti-commutators in the quantum
theory:
{Qα, ¯Qβ} = 1
2(γµ)α
βPµ,
{Qα, Qβ} = 0.
(2.20)
For theories with extended supersymmetry, meaning N > 1, there are N super-
charges QI
α with I = 1, · · · , N. These obey the algebra
{QI
α, ¯Qβ
J} = 1
2(γµ)α
βPµ δI
J,
(2.21)
while for the {QI
α, QJ
β} bracket the index structure suggests the new possibility of
including antisymmetric ‘central charges’ ZIJ = −ZJI appearing on the right-hand
side:
{QI
α, QJ
β} = CαβZIJ,
(2.22)
where Cαβ is the charge conjugation matrix, which raises and lowers Majorana spinor
indices. The central charges are ‘central’ in the group-theoretic sense in that they
commute with all the generators of the super-Poincar´e group1.
In general there is a group R of linear transformations that preserve the super-
algebra – its automorphisms. This automorphism group (excluding the Poincar´e
group itself) is called the R-symmetry. Its transformations simply act like rotations
on the set of supercharges and commute with the Poincar´e generators Pµ and Jµν.
To see the R-symmetry in D = 4 it is useful to choose the Weyl representation
representation for the gamma matrices:
γµ =
 
0
σµ
¯σµ
0
!
,
(2.23)
where σµ are the set of Pauli matrices σi, i = 1, 2, 3, with the identity included for
the zero-component:
¯σµ = σµ = (+1, σi),
σµ = ¯σµ = (−1, σi).
(2.24)
1In general the center of a group G is the set of elements Z(G) that commute with every element
of the group: Z(G) = {z ∈G | ∀g ∈G, zg = gz}.
22

Then one ﬁnds that since the supersymmetry generator QI
α is a Majorana spinor it
has the form
QI
α =

QI
1, QI
2, Q†
I2, −Q†
I1

.
(2.25)
Thus, since the second two components are Hermitian conjugates of the ﬁrst two
(still considering the supercharges as quantum operators), any complex linear trans-
formation of the generators will need to transform the second two components in
a conjugate representation to that of the ﬁrst two. Then for any QI satisfying the
(anti-)commutators (2.21) and (2.22) above, the algebra is invariant under

QI
1, QI
2

→U I
J

QJ
1, QJ
2

,
(2.26)
where U is a unitary matrix UU † = U †U = 1. Thus the algebra has a chiral U(N)
R-symmetry when D = 4.
In the case of N = 1 supersymmetry in D = 4, although there is only one Q there
is still a U(1) R-symmetry. Here equation (2.26) can be written in terms of the full
Majorana spinor Q
Q →eiθγ∗Q,
θ ∈R,
(2.27)
where γ∗(sometimes called γ5) is
γ∗= iγ0γ1γ2γ3 =
 
1
0
0
−1
!
.
(2.28)
This U(1) symmetry is realised in the N = 1 super Yang-Mills theory by the invari-
ance of the Lagrangian (2.7) and transformation rules (2.9) under
λA →eiθγ∗λA.
(2.29)
Note that θ is a constant so this is a global symmetry. In most supersymmetric
theories in this thesis the R-symmetry will appear as a global symmetry of the
Lagrangian.
2.4. Supermultiplets
A natural question to ask when constructing theories is what kind of supermulti-
plets exist in four spacetime dimensions when there are N supersymmetries. Only
massless multiplets will appear in this thesis. The simplest way to derive the pos-
sible supermultiplets is to consider quantum particle states transforming under the
supersymmetry generators.
These states must form a representation of the su-
23

persymmetry algebra, i.e. transform into one another under the action of the QI
operators, so the goal is to determine a basis for such a set of states transforming
irreducibly under supersymmetry.
Since the supercharges QI commute with translations Pµ, supersymmetry trans-
formations must preserve the momentum of on-shell states. As a result one may
simply set pµ = (|E|, 0, 0, E) for any state for the remainder of this discussion with-
out loss of generality. Then, since all particle states are assumed to have momentum
pµ of this form, a one-particle state |h⟩is entirely speciﬁed by its helicity h = ±s,
where s is the particle’s spin. Helicity can be deﬁned as the eigenvalue under the
operator J3 = J12, which generates the little group SO(2) – the subgroup of SO(1, 3)
that preserves the form of pµ above2.
Using the Weyl basis (2.23) and the corresponding form of QI in (2.25), the
{QI
α, ¯Qβ
J} anti-commutator becomes
{QI
1, Q†
J1} = 0,
{QI
2, Q†
J2} = δI
J|E|,
(2.30)
for the components QI
1 and QI
2. The QI
1 operator produces unphysical states of zero
norm, since for any state |ψ⟩,
⟨ψ|{QI
1, Q†
I1}|ψ⟩= 2
Q†
I1|ψ⟩
2 = 0,
(no sum on I).
(2.31)
Hence QI
1 and Q†
I1 can be ignored. As for the QI
2 operator, it is useful to deﬁne a
normalised version αI := |E|−1/2QI
2 so that
{αI, α†
J} = δI
J,
{αI, αJ} = {α†
I, α†
J} = 0.
(2.32)
Then, using the super-Poincar´e algebra it is easy to show that
[J3, α†
I] = −1
2α†
I,
[J3, αI] = 1
2αI,
(2.33)
i.e. one may view αI as having helicity 1/2 and α†
I as having helicity -1/2. Thus each
supersymmetry generator QI
α corresponds to an anti-commuting lowering (raising)
operator α†
I (αI), which lowers (raises) the helicity of a state by 1/2. Deﬁne the
‘vacuum’ state |h0⟩, with h0 any positive or negative integer or half-integer, to be
such that
αI|h0⟩= 0,
J3|h0⟩= h0|h0⟩,
∀I = 1, · · · , N.
(2.34)
2Note that the little group in D dimensions is actually ISO(D−2), but the translation generators
are neglected since they annihilate physical states, leaving only SO(D −2) with a non-trivial
action.
24

The representation will then have a basis built up by acting with successive α†
I
operators on |h0⟩:
|h0⟩,
α†
I|h0⟩,
α†
Iα†
J|h0⟩,
α†
Iα†
Jα†
K|h0⟩,
· · · ,
α†
I1α†
I2 · · · α†
IN |h0⟩.
(2.35)
A state with m lowering operators has helicity h0 −1
2m. The lowering operators
anti-commute with one another, so each level comes with its I, J, K, · · · indices
antisymmetrised. Thus the multiplicity of states at level m is the binomial coeﬃcient
 N
m

, and there are 2N states in total. Furthermore, since the α†
I operators transform
under R-symmetry U(N) ∼= SU(N) × U(1) as
α†
I →eiθ UI
Jα†
J,
UI
J ∈SU(N),
θ ∈R,
(2.36)
the states at level m transform as the m-index antisymmetric tensor representation
of SU(N) with charge m under the U(1) factor:
α†
I1α†
I2 · · · α†
Im|h0⟩→eimθ UI1
J1UI2
J2 · · · UIm
Jmα†
J1α†
J2 · · · α†
Jm|h0⟩
(2.37)
For every supermultiplet the total number of bosonic and fermionic states must
be equal; if h0 is an integer then states with odd numbers of α†
I operators have
half-integer helicity and there are 2N−1 of these in total, while states with even
numbers of α†
I operators have integer helicity and again there are 2N−1 of these.
The argument is the same with (odd and even reversed) when h0 is a half-integer.
As an example, consider h0 = 1 with N = 2 – so I = 1, 2 and the R-symmetry
group is U(2).
There is one state |1⟩with helicity 1, two states |1/2⟩I = a†
I|1⟩
with helicity 1/2 and one state |0⟩IJ = α†
Iα†
J|1⟩with helicity 0 (note that the N-
index antisymmetric tensor is a singlet under SU(N) since it is proportional to
the invariant epsilon tensor εI1I2···IN ). Group theoretically these transform as the
representations 11,0, 2 1
2 ,1 and 10,2, where the ﬁrst subscript indicates the helicity
and the second is the charge under the U(1) factor of the R-symmetry U(2) ∼=
SU(2) × U(1).
There is slight a subtlety in the above example: since any physical space of states
must include both helicities h = ±s, one must add to the irreducible multiplet above
its CPT-conjugate, giving a reducible representation of the supersymmetry algebra.
The CPT-conjugate multiplet is obtained by starting with |−h0⟩as the vacuum and
acting successively with αI operators, raising the helicity of the states. Thus the
CPT-conjugate representations for h0 = 1 and N = 2 are 1−1,0, 2−1
2 ,−1 and 10,−2.
In total this means that the corresponding theory’s ﬁeld content should be a spin-
25

1 vector Aµ, two spin-1/2 fermions λI and a complex scalar ﬁeld φ, transforming
on-shell as the representations
Aµ : 11,0 + 1−1,0,
λI : 2 1
2 ,1 + 2−1
2 ,−1,
φ : 10,2,
φ∗: 10,−2
(2.38)
of U(1)ST × U(2), where U(1)ST ∼= SO(2) is the spacetime little group. This is the
ﬁeld content of N = 2 super Yang-Mills theory, which will appear several times in
the coming chapters.
For typical supermultiplets the CPT-conjugate must be added as above. However,
in the special cases when N = 4|h0|, the initial multiplet in (2.35) is already self-
conjugate.
For example, consider the special case of N = 4 and h0 = 1 with
multiplet content
Aµ : 11,0 + 1−1,4,
λI : 4 1
2 ,1 + ¯4−1
2 ,3,
φ[IJ] : 60,2.
(2.39)
These are the ﬁelds of N = 4 super Yang-Mills. Note that it is the maximal theory
containing spins s = |h| no greater than 1; starting from h0 = 1, if N were any
greater then the helicities would be lowered beyond −1. Again there is a subtlety,
which is that the U(1) R-symmetry charges do not match up for the positive and
negative helicity states.
This means that this group is not compatible with the
spacetime little group U(1)ST and hence cannot be a physical symmetry. The charges
on the right may simply be discarded. In general then for multiplets with N = 4|h0|,
the physical R-symmetry group is SU(N) rather than U(N).
The other particular case of interest is N = 8, h0 = 2 with R-symmetry SU(8).
Here the multiplet content is
gµν :
12 + 1−2,
ΨµI :
8 3
2 + ¯8−3
2,
Aµ[IJ] : 281 + 28−1,
λ[IJK] : 56 1
2 + 56−1
2,
φ[IJKL] :
700.
(2.40)
Since the highest spin in this multiplet is 2, it contains a graviton and hence corre-
sponds to a supergravity theory. Also note the presence of eight spin-3
2 ﬁelds. These
represent fermionic vector-spinors called ‘gravitinos’ (or sometimes ‘gravitini’ is used
for the plural), which will be discussed in the following section. Any multiplet with
h0 = 2 must contain N gravitino ﬁelds transforming in the fundamental rep of the
R-symmetry U(N) (or SU(N)), since they correspond to the states |3/2⟩I = α†
I|2⟩.
26

By the same argument used for N = 4 super Yang-Mills above, the N = 8
multiplet is the largest containing spins s = |h| no greater than 2. Because consistent
interacting theories with spins greater than 2 are very diﬃcult – if not impossible –
to write down, the N = 8 theory is considered the maximally supersymmetric ﬁeld
theory.
Before moving onto supergravity proper there is a little terminology to deﬁne. A
supermultiplet is often referred to by the name of its ﬁeld with the highest spin. A
gravity multiplet has highest spin 2; a vector multiplet has highest spin 1; a chiral
multiplet (or Wess-Zumino multiplet) has highest spin 1/2 (this particular name
is reserved only for N = 1); a hyper-multiplet has highest spin 1/2 (this time for
N = 2 only). Analogous multiplets also appear in spacetime dimensions D ̸= 4 –
see [43] for the original and complete survey.
2.5. Local Supersymmetry: Supergravity
In the ﬁeld theories discussed above, the supersymmetry parameter ϵ is a constant
spinor; the symmetry is global. However, since any realistic ﬁeld theory must ulti-
mately contain gravity, the problem arises that on a non-trivial spacetime manifold
a ‘constant’ spinor is no longer well-deﬁned in general3. This is easy to see, since if
ϵ(x) is constant in the whole of some coordinate patch U1 with coordinates x, then on
the overlap with another coordinate patch U2 with coordinates x′, in general, ϵ(x′)
will not be constant. Therefore, if gravity is to be included in a supersymmetric
ﬁeld theory one must replace ϵ →ϵ(x), making supersymmetry local.
Conversely, by the following argument, local supersymmetry requires gravity. The
commutator of two supersymmetry transformations with parameters ϵ1 and ϵ2 yields
a spacetime translation by aµ = −i
2¯ϵ1γµϵ2. Thus letting ϵ1 and ϵ2 depend on the
spacetime coordinates x results in a local translation, i.e. an inﬁnitesimal general co-
ordinate transformation4. Therefore local supersymmetry implies general coordinate
invariance and hence requires gravity. Supergravity is this marriage of supersym-
metry and gravity.
A local symmetry needs a gauge ﬁeld, which acts like a connection, allowing one
to deﬁne covariant derivatives. In the case of local supersymmetry this gauge ﬁeld
is the fermionic vector-spinor gravitino Ψµ. Also known as a Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld,
3The closest thing to a ‘constant spinor’ is a covariantly constant spinor, but this will still in
general depend on the manifold’s coordinates.
4For any tensor ﬁeld T, the change due to an inﬁnitesimal local translation along a vector ﬁeld ξ
is a Lie derivative δT = LξT, but this is just the change under an inﬁnitesimal diﬀeomorphism.
Therefore inﬁnitesimal local translations and diﬀeomorphisms have the same eﬀect.
27

in four dimensions the gravitino is a spin-3
2 ﬁeld and is sometimes referred to as the
‘superpartner’ of the spin-2 graviton. As demonstrated in the previous section, any
supersymmetric multiplet that contains the graviton – and has spins ≤2 – must
also contain at least one gravitino. More precisely, a theory with extended local
supersymmetry N > 1 must have N gravitino ﬁelds – one to gauge each of the N
independent supersymmetries.
The action for a free massless Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld in D-dimensional Minkowski
spacetime is [42]
S = −
Z
dDx i¯Ψµγµνρ∂νΨρ,
(2.41)
where γµνρ is the rank-3 Cliﬀord algebra element
γµνρ = γ[µγνγρ].
(2.42)
Note that (2.41) is the most obvious action to write down that is Lorentz-invariant,
quadratic in Ψµ, Hermitian and ﬁrst order in derivatives; this is everything one
might reasonably expect from the action of a relativistic fermion, given the features
of the Dirac action for an ordinary massless spin-1
2 ﬁeld. In this thesis all Rarita-
Schwinger ﬁelds will be massless, but in general a mass term −m¯ΨµγµνΨν may also
be added.
Just as the Maxwell action has a gauge symmetry under the replacement Aµ →
Aµ + ∂µθ, the Rarita-Schwinger action (2.41) is invariant up to a total derivative
under
Ψµ →Ψµ + ∂µϵ,
(2.43)
where ϵ(x) is an arbitrary spinor parameter. This gauge symmetry makes the grav-
itino a suitable gauge ﬁeld for local supersymmetry.
For a supergravity theory the gravitino and any other fermions must be described
in curved spacetime. In general in a gravitational theory, since a spinor is deﬁned
to transform in the double cover of the Lorentz group Spin(1, D −1), it must be
described by its components in a local Lorentz frame. This requires the vielbein
ﬁeld ea
µ(x), which relates the curved-space metric gµν(x) to the ordinary Minkowski
metric ηab = diag(−1, 1, · · · , 1):
gµν(x) =: ea
µ(x)eb
ν(x) ηab.
(2.44)
This equation is invariant under local Lorentz transformations ea
µ(x) →Λab(x)eb
µ(x).
Thus the indices a, b are referred to as local Lorentz indices and are raised and
lowered using ηab and ηab, respectively.
28

In the vielbein formalism for general relativity, ea
µ becomes the central dynamical
ﬁeld in place of gµν and carries the same information. As a 4×4 matrix ea
µ has a priori
D2 components in D dimensions, but since it is only deﬁned up to a local Lorentz
transformation one must subtract dim[O(1, D−1)] = 1
2D(D−1) components, leaving
a total of 1
2D(D + 1) – precisely the same number as the usual symmetric matrix
gµν.
The analogue of the aﬃne connection Γµ
νρ in this language is the spin connection
ωµab, which is deﬁned to be the gauge ﬁeld associated with local Lorentz transfor-
mations, and thus transforms as
ωµ
a
b →Λ−1a
c ∂µΛc
b + Λ−1a
c ωµ
c
d Λd
b,
(2.45)
i.e. as a Yang-Mills ﬁeld with gauge group O(1, D −1). The covariant derivatives
of Lorentz vectors and tensors may then be deﬁned in the usual way; for example,
DµV a := ∂µV a + ωµ
a
bV b.
(2.46)
For a metric-compatible connection, the spin connection is related to the connection
coeﬃcients Γµ
νρ by
ωµ
a
b = ea

 ∂µeν
b + Γν
µρeρ



ν∇µeν

(2.47)
where eµ
a is the inverse of the vielbein.
Since the generators of Lorentz transformations for spinors are 1
2γab, the Lorentz-
covariant derivative for a spinor ﬁeld ψ(x) is deﬁned as
Dµψ :=
 ∂µ + 1
4ωµ
abγab

ψ.
(2.48)
With the above deﬁnitions in place, it is simple to write down the action for
D = 4, N = 1 supergravity with the single gravity multiplet {gµν, Ψµ} or {ea
µ, Ψµ}:
S =
Z
d4x√−g
 R −i¯ΨµγµνρDνΨρ

,
(2.49)
where R is the Ricci scalar. The supersymmetry transformations are
δea
µ = i
2¯ϵγaΨµ,
δΨµ = Dµϵ.
(2.50)
Note that the action (2.49) assumes a ﬁrst order formalism in which ea
µ and ωµab are
treated as separate independent variables, with R = R(ω) treated as a function of
ω rather than e. To obtain a second order action one must vary ﬁrst with respect to
29

the spin connection to obtain its equation of motion, which may then be substituted
back into (2.49).
2.6. Eleven-Dimensional Supergravity
A spinor of the Cliﬀord algebra in D dimensions has 2⌊D/2⌋components, where ⌊D/2⌋
is deﬁned to be the integer part of D/2, i.e. equal to D/2 when D is even and (D −
1)/2 when D is odd. In Section 2.4 it was demonstrated that with D = 4 the maximal
supergravity has N = 8. Since a Majorana spinor in D = 4 has 4 components this
means that the 8 supercharges of the N = 8 theory make up 32 components in total.
This matches the dimension of a single spinor supercharge in D = 11, which means
that D = 11, N = 1 supergravity must have the maximum dimension possible for
a supersymmetric theory. This is equivalent to the requirement that there are no
spins greater than 2 in the supersymmetry multiplet.
Having established that D = 11 is the maximum dimension for supersymmetry
with a unique N = 1 theory, it is natural to ask what this theory’s ﬁeld content and
Lagrangian look like. As an N = 1 supergravity theory it must contain a massless
graviton gµν and a gravitino Ψµ. The little group SO(D −2) for D = 11 is SO(9)
and the graviton’s on-shell degrees of freedom must transform as the symmetric
traceless representation 44, while the gravitino’s transform as the vector-spinor 128.
This means there is mismatch of 84 degrees of freedom between the bosonic and
fermionic sectors. Fortunately there is a representation of precisely this dimension,
the 3-form Cµνρ, whose on-shell degrees of freedom transform as the irreducible 84
representation of SO(9). Thus one expects the supermultiplet in eleven dimensions
to have ﬁeld content
{gµν, Cµνρ, Ψµ}.
(2.51)
Cremmer and Julia derived the Lagrangian of the corresponding theory. Their
method was simply to write down the kinetic terms
L = √−g

R −i¯ΨµγµνρDνΨρ −1
24FµνρσF µνρσ
,
(2.52)
where Fµνρσ = 4∂[µCνρσ] is the ﬁeld strength of the 3-form ﬁeld. Then, a sensible
ansatz for the supersymmetry transformations is
δgµν = c1
 i¯ϵγ(µΨν)

,
δCµνρ = c2
 i¯ϵγ[µνΨρ]

,
δΨµ = c3Dµϵ + Γνρστ
µFνρστϵ,
(2.53)
30

where c1, c2, c3 are constants to be ﬁxed and Γνρστ µ is a linear combination of prod-
ucts of gamma matrices to be determined. Varying the Lagrangian with respect
to these transformations one ﬁnds that various corrections and interactions must
be added and eventually, after many calculations, the full supersymmetric theory
is obtained. The interaction terms are not given here but will be presented in an
octonionic formalism in Chapter 7.
As a theory with the maximal number of dimensions for maximal supersymmetry,
eleven-dimensional supergravity is certainly singled out as special. It should also be
the low-energy limit of M-theory, the speculated eleven-dimensional master theory
that contains in various limits the ﬁve ten-dimensional string theories.
By the
process of dimensional reduction introduced in the following section, the D = 11
supergravity also leads to maximal supergravity theories for all D < 11 – including
the N = 8 theory in D = 4 – as well as truncations to a myriad of non-maximal
supergravities.
2.7. Kaluza-Klein Theory
String theory predicts that the world has ten spacetime dimensions, while its con-
jectured parent M-theory goes precisely one step further, predicting eleven. One
way to reconcile this with the apparent four-dimensional universe is to use Kaluza-
Klein theory. In general this is a technique for recovering a low-energy eﬀective
D-dimensional theory from a higher-dimensional (D + d)-dimensional theory. The
most remarkable aspect of the idea is its scope for uniﬁcation; gauge symmetries in
D dimensions are interpreted simply as gravitational symmetries in D + d dimen-
sions. The key is to assume that the (D + d)-dimensional spacetime MD+d locally
takes the form of a product manifold
MD+d ∼MD × Md,
(2.54)
where Md is a compact d-manifold whose size (with respect to the metric on MD+d)
is very small compared to the energy scales of interest, such as those probed by cur-
rent particle accelerators. The resulting eﬀective theory appears to have spacetime
MD, with only D observable dimensions.
As a simple example, consider the theory of a massless real scalar ﬁeld Φ in D +1
ﬂat dimensions satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation
□(D+1)Φ = 0,
(2.55)
31

where □(D+1) = ∂M∂M with M = 0, 1, · · · , D. Suppose that the spacetime manifold
is a product of D-dimensional Minkowski space R1,D−1 and a circle S1,
MD+1 = R1,D−1 × S1.
(2.56)
One may parameterise such that the ﬁrst D coordinates xµ, µ = 0, · · · , (D −1),
refer to R1,D−1 while the (D + 1)th coordinate xD =: z is the coordinate on S1. This
means that z is periodic,
z ∼z + 2πnR,
n ∈Z,
R = constant,
(2.57)
where R is the radius of the circle.
One may Fourier expand Φ in the circular
dimension, so that
Φ(xµ, z) =
X
n∈Z
Φn(xµ)einz/R
(2.58)
for Fourier modes Φn(xµ), which depend only on the D extended dimensions. Sub-
stituting this into the Klein-Gordon equation (2.55) gives

□(D) −n2
R

Φn(xµ) = 0,
(2.59)
where □(D) = ∂µ∂µ. This is the equation of motion for a scalar ﬁeld of mass |n|/R;
in the D-dimensional theory the massless (D + 1)-dimensional ﬁeld Φ(xM) appears
as an inﬁnite tower of massive scalars Φn(xµ). Since the extra dimension is intended
to be unobservable, R is taken to be very small compared to the physical scale of
interest, which means that the mass |n|/R is very large for n ̸= 0. These modes
are not excited at low energies. Thus in the low-energy physics only the massless
zero mode Φ0(xµ) is detectable and one may truncate all Φn(xµ) with n ̸= 0 from
the theory by setting them to zero. By equation (2.58) this is equivalent to setting
∂zΦ = 0, i.e. demanding that Φ is independent of the compact coordinate z. This is
the typical procedure of Kaluza-Klein reduction: a compactiﬁcation and a truncation
to the massless sector5.
Since any free dynamical ﬁeld satisﬁes the Klein-Gordon equation, the same ar-
gument must also apply to spinors, vectors, Rarita-Schwinger ﬁelds and tensor
ﬁelds on any (D + d)-dimensional background of the form R1,D−1 × T d, where
T d = S1 × S1 · · · × S1 is the d-torus. The set of higher-dimensional coordinates
5A subtlety is that these truncations must be consistent. That is, one must check in the ﬁeld
equations that the massive modes are not sourced by the massless modes, as this would pre-
clude setting the massive modes to zero. However, for Kaluza-Klein reduction on a circle the
truncation is always guaranteed to be consistent.
32

{xM} may be split into {xµ, zm}, where xµ are coordinates on R1,D−1 and zm are
coordinates on T d,
µ = 0, 1, · · · , (D −1),
m = 1, · · · , d,
(2.60)
and the low-energy physics depends only on ﬁeld conﬁgurations that are independent
of the zm directions. As a result one may formally just write ∂m ≃0 to obtain the D-
dimensional theory. However, for ﬁelds carrying non-trivial Lorentz representations
one must also decompose their components into irreducible representations of the
lower-dimensional Lorentz group.
For example, a massless Maxwell 1-form ﬁeld AM becomes a D-dimensional 1-form
Aµ and d scalar ﬁelds Am. With ∂mAM = 0 the Lagrangian simply becomes
−1
4FMNF MN = −1
4 (FµνF µν + 2FµmF µm) = −1
4FµνF µν −1
2∂µAm∂µAm,
(2.61)
as expected for the Lagrangian of d massless scalars and a Maxwell ﬁeld in D
dimensions. Note that the scalar ﬁelds Am have an internal global SO(d) symmetry
under rotations Am →OmnAn with O ∈SO(d). This is just the residual symmetry
from breaking the higher-dimensional Lorentz group SO(1, D+d−1) into SO(1, D−
1):
SO(1, D −1) × SO(d) ⊂SO(1, D + d −1).
(2.62)
The same logic applies to any p-form ﬁeld AM1M2···Mp in D + d dimensions; in
the D-dimensional theory this becomes a p-form Aµ1µ2···µp, d distinct (p −1)-forms
Aµ1µ2···µ(p−1)m,
 d
2

distinct (p −2)-forms Aµ1µ2···µ(p−2)mn, . . . and so on.
For spinor ﬁelds a complete and general treatment requires more detail on Cliﬀord
algebras than will be presented here. However, the key is that a spinor λ¯α, where
¯α is a spinor index of SO(1, D + d −1), may be written as λαa, where α is a spinor
index of SO(1, D −1) and a is an internal spinor index of SO(d).
For a Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld ΨM ¯α the vector index must also be decomposed into
µ and m. A particularly relevent example is D = 4 and d = 7: the reduction of a
gravitino in eleven dimensions down to D = 4. In this case ¯α = 1, · · · , 32. Then
one may write ¯α as a composite index ¯α = αa, where α = 1, · · · , 4 is the Majorana
spinor index of SO(1, 3) and a = 1, · · · , 8 (since 4 × 8 = 32). Thus the gravitino
ΨM ¯α = ΨMαa in D + d = 11 becomes eight D = 4 Majorana gravitinos Ψµαa (with
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3) and 7 × 8 = 56 Majorana fermions Ψmαa (with m = 1, · · · , 7).
A more involved but more interesting torus reduction is that of gravity. Consider
pure Einstein gravity in D+d dimensions with a spacetime that is locally a (warped)
product MD × T d, where MD is a Lorentzian D-manifold. The full metric GMN
33

decomposes into a D-dimensional metric Gµν, d vector ﬁelds Gµm = Gmµ and 1
2d2(d+
1) scalar ﬁelds packaged in a symmetric matrix Gmn = Gnm. As argued above, in
the low-energy physics each of these ﬁelds is independent of the torus coordinates
zm.
The following particular choice of metric ansatz turns out to give a straightforward
Lagrangian for the lower-dimensional ﬁelds:
GMN =
 
Gµν
Gµn
Gmν
Gmn
!

e2αϕgµν + e2βϕAm
µ An
νMmn
e2βϕMmnAm

e2βϕMmnAn
ν
e2βϕMmn
!
,
(2.63)
where Mmn = Mnm is taken to be in SL(d, R); its determinant has been factorised
to give the exponential factor e2βϕ, so that (e2βϕ)d is the volume of the d-torus as
a function on MD. After a suitable choice of the constants α and β in terms of D
and d, the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian becomes
√
−GRG = √−g
 Rg −1
2∂µϕ∂µϕ + 1
4∂µMmn∂µMnm −1
4e2cϕFm
µνMmnFnµν
,
(2.64)
where Fm
µν = ∂µAm
ν −∂νAm
µ , the matrix Mmn is the inverse of Mmn and c is a
constant depending on D and d. This is precisely the Lagrangian one would hope
for: the D-dimensional Einstein theory coupled to scalars and Maxwell-like vectors.
Note however that the scalars couple non-canonically to the kinetic term of the
vector ﬁelds. This is not a problem in general, but was actually what ruled out
Kaluza and Klein’s original theory as a uniﬁcation of gravity and electromagnetism
(the special case with D = 4 and d = 1).
The (D + d)-dimensional gravity theory is of course invariant under general coor-
dinate transformations (GCTs). For a small change in the coordinates
δxM = −ξM(x),
(2.65)
the metric transforms via a Lie derivative
δGMN = ξP∂PGMN + GPN∂MξP + GMP∂NξP.
(2.66)
In general such a transformation does not preserve the metric ansatz (2.63) and so
will not be a symmetry of the D-dimensional theory. However, if ξ is chosen to
be independent of the zm coordinates, ∂mξM = 0, then the metric ansatz (2.63)
will be preserved. In this case, splitting equation (2.66) into its lower-dimensional
34

components according to (2.63) gives
δgµν = ξρ∂ρgµν + gρν∂µξρ + gµρ∂νξρ,
δAm
µ = ξρ∂ρAm
µ + Am
ν ∂µξν + ∂µξm,
δMmn = ξρ∂ρMmn,
δϕ = ξρ∂ρϕ.
(2.67)
Thus the higher-dimensional GCT leads to a lower-dimensional GCT as well as a
gauge transformation for each of the Maxwell ﬁelds, δAm
µ = ∂µθm with θm = ξm.
In this framework the U(1) ∼= S1 gauge symmetry of each vector ﬁeld simply corre-
sponds to the residual general coordinate invariance of each circular extra dimension.
This demonstrates the powerful potential for uniﬁcation oﬀered by Kaluza-Klein the-
ory; gauge symmetries are simply special cases of higher-dimensional gravitational
symmetries.
There are in fact more (D +d)-dimensional GCTs that preserve the metric ansatz
(2.63). It is easy to check that one may allow the diﬀeomorphism parameters ξm to
depend linearly on the torus coordinates zm:
ξm = Sm
nzn + θm,
(2.68)
where Smn is a constant matrix belonging to the Lie algebra sl(d, R), i.e. real and
traceless (Smm = 0), and θm(xµ) depends only on the xµ coordinates. Again, taking
lower-dimensional components of equation (2.66) using (2.63) shows that this results
in
δAm
µ = Sm
nAn
µ,
δMmn = Sp
mMpn + Sp
nMmp,
(2.69)
while gµν and ϕ remain invariant (here θm has been set to zero). Thus the Lagrangian
(2.64) is invariant under the SL(d, R) transformations (2.69). Furthermore, the full
symmetry is GL(d, R) ∼= SL(d, R) × R, since the Lagrangian is also invariant under
constant shifts of ϕ combined with scaling Am
µ :
ϕ(x) →ϕ(x) + k,
k ∈R,
Am
µ (x) →e−ckAm
µ .
(2.70)
Because (e2βϕ)d represents the volume of the d-torus, this shift corresponds to the
symmetry under scaling or ‘dilating’ its overall size6. The ϕ ﬁeld is usually called a
6More precisely, this comes from combining the symmetry of the higher-dimensional Einstein
35

dilaton due to this fact.
To gain a better understanding of the scalar kinetic term
1
4∂µMmn∂µMnm in
(2.64) it is useful to consider the higher-dimensional vielbein EM A, satisfying
ηABEM
AEN
B = GMN,
(2.71)
so that the A, B indices label local Lorentz frames. These indices then split into
a = 0, 1, · · · , (D −1) and i = 1, · · · , d.
Due to the local Lorentz-invariance of
equation (2.71) under EM A →ΛAB(x)EM B with ΛCA ηCD ΛDB = ηAB, it is possible
to choose a gauge such that the vielbein corresponding to GMN above is upper-
triangular:

(2.72)
where Vmi ∈SL(d, R) is like the vielbein for Mmn,

i = Mmn,
(2.73)
and ea
µ is the D-dimensional vielbein for the metric gµν. Equation (2.73) is invariant
under
Vm
i →Oi

(2.74)
where Oij is a d × d unimodular orthogonal matrix. This local SO(d) symmetry is
hence also a symmetry of the Lagrangian (2.64), and simply represents the redun-
dancy in using a unimodular d × d matrix Vmi to package fewer than d2 −1 scalars
(1
2d2(d + 1) −1 scalars, to be precise). The higher-dimensional origin of this sym-
metry is that the upper-triangular gauge in (2.72) is preserved under block-diagonal
local Lorentz transformations EM A →ΛAB(x)EM B of the form
ΛA
B(x) =

where Λab is a Lorentz transformation in D dimensions and Oij is orthogonal.
The scalar ﬁelds in the kinetic term 1
4∂µMmn∂µMnm describe a non-linear sigma
model. This is a scalar ﬁeld theory where the scalars are smooth maps from space-
time to another manifold, called the target space or ‘scalar manifold’. For example,
consider N + 1 scalar ﬁelds φi, i = 1, · · · , (N + 1), described by the Lagrangian
equations under scalings of the metric by a positive constant GMN →ek1 GMN, k1 ∈R, with
uniform scaling of the torus δzm = k2zm. The constant shift k of ϕ is then a linear combination
of k1 and k2. See [44] for more detail on this.

2∂µφi∂µφi subject to the constraint that φiφi = 1. These scalars are maps
from spacetime to the unit sphere SN. Since Vmi only appears in the Lagrangian
via Mmn, which is invariant under (2.74), Vmi and Oij(x)Vmj are physically indis-
tinguishable, and Vmi ∈SL(d, R) is essentially only deﬁned up to an SO(d) transfor-
mation. Thus the scalar ﬁelds in Vmi parameterise the non-compact coset manifold
SL(d, R)/ SO(d). Note that the coset SL(d, R)/ SO(d) has dimension 1
2d2(d+1)−1,
as required, since this is the number of scalar ﬁelds described by the original matrix
Mmn.
To construct more traditional kinetic terms of the form −1
2∂µφ∂µφ + · · · , a gauge
must be chosen for the coset representative Vmi, with a particular labelling of its
components in terms of the individual scalar ﬁelds it parameterises. This can be
achieved by working directly with the Lie algebra sl(d, R). As a speciﬁc example,
consider the d = 2 case. The Lie algebra sl(2, R) has basis

with commutators
[H, E+] = 2E+,
[H, E−] = −2E−,
[E+, E−] = H,
(2.77)
so E+ is positive-root generator and E−is a negative root generator under the
Cartan subalgebra, which in this case consists of the only diagonal generator H. A
convenient choice of upper-triangular 2 × 2 coset representative turns out to be

(2.80)
In this form the physical content is easier to see, but the SL(2, R) symmetry that
acted linearly on the matrix Mmn is no longer manifest. Its action on the individual
37

ﬁelds φ and χ is non-linear and rather complicated:
eφ →(Cχ + D)2eφ + C2e−φ,
χeφ →(Aχ + B)(Cχ + D)eφ + ACe−φ,

(2.82)
In the general case, with Lie algebra sl(d, R), constructing the scalar coset La-
grangian works analogously. The Cartan subalgebra consists of the basis of traceless
d × d diagonal matrices ⃗H, written here all together as a (d −1)-component vec-
tor. The positive-root generators are matrices Eij, i < j, which have components
(Eij)kl = δikδjl, i.e. the ijth element of Eij is equal to 1 and every other element is
zero. The commutators can be written as
[ ⃗H, Eij] = ⃗bijEij,
i < j (no sum),
(2.83)
where {⃗bij} with i < j is the set of positive root vectors.
In analogy with equation (2.78), a useful parameterisation of V is the upper-
triangular matrix
V = e
1
2 ⃗φ(x)· ⃗H Y
i<j
eχij(x)Eij.
(2.84)
Then one may form M = VTV and the scalar Lagrangian can be written in terms
of the individual ﬁelds as

4∂µMmn∂µMnm = −1
2∂µ⃗φ · ∂µ⃗φ −1
2
X
i<j

⃗bij·⃗φ∂µχij∂µχij.
(2.85)
The root vectors ⃗bij in this context are often referred to as ‘dilaton vectors’, since
each of the φ ﬁelds is a dilaton representing the radius of one of the circles of the
d-torus (overall ϕ and ⃗φ are just the diagonal components of the original metric on
the torus). In Chapter 7 they will be connected with the octonions in a surprising
way.
It is also important to note that since all ﬁelds in a gravitational theory with mat-
ter couple to the metric (via GMN factors which contract their kinetic-term indices,
as well as the determinant factor
√
−G), one must use the ansatz (2.63) to carefully
determine the couplings of the various lower-dimensional ﬁelds. In particular, after
some ﬁeld redeﬁnitions, the lower-dimensional theory may be parameterised such
38

that every bosonic ﬁeld (except for the metric) has an exponential coupling e
⃗b·⃗φ as
a factor appearing in its kinetic term. Thus, each bosonic ﬁeld has its own unique
dilaton vector.
2.8. U-Dualities
Having discussed the Kaluza-Klein theory of pure gravity, the next step is to turn
to eleven-dimensional supergravity and compactify on a d-torus to obtain maximal
supergravities in dimensions D = 11−d. This will not be carried out explicitly here,
but the general features of the resulting theories will be discussed. For a detailed
and pedagogical account see [44].
One particularly intesting aspect of these reductions is that scalars descended
from the 3-form ﬁeld7 CMNP conspire with those descended from the metric gMN
to give an enlarged scalar coset sigma model with a greatly enlarged ‘hidden’ sym-
metry group. For example, consider the scalars of the D = 4 theory obtained from
reduction on the 7-torus.
In the previous section it was demonstrated that the
Kaluza-Klein reduction of pure gravity on T 7 gives rise to an SL(7, R)/ SO(7) scalar
coset Lagrangian and the total global symmetry group was in fact GL(7, R). Thus
there are
dim[GL(7, R)] −dim[SO(7)] = 49 −21 = 28
(2.86)
scalar ﬁelds descended from the eleven-dimensional metric. There are also
 7
3

= 35
scalars given by the 3-form’s internal components Cijk, where i, j, k = 1, · · · , 7.
Finally there are an additional seven scalar ﬁelds coming from the 2-forms Cµνi
by the process of dualisation; the 3-form ﬁeld strengths Fµνρi = 3∂[µCνρ]i of these
2-form ﬁelds may be deﬁned as the Hodge duals of seven 1-form ﬁeld strengths

while the Bianchi identity for the scalar ﬁelds gives the equation of motion for the
2-forms:
εµνρσ∂µ∂νΦi = ∂µ
√−ggµνgρλgστe⃗ai·⃗φFνλτi

(2.90)
This means that the scalar kinetic term
−1
2
√−g e−⃗ai·⃗φ∂µΦi∂µΦi
(2.91)
will give equivalent overall equations of motion and Bianchi identities, and thus
the seven 2-forms may be replaced with the seven scalars Φi. In total this gives
7 + 35 + 28 = 70 scalar ﬁelds, just as required for the N = 8 supermultiplet derived
in Section 2.4. There it was shown that the 70 scalars transformed as the irreducible
70 representation of the R-symmetry group SU(8). Since SU(8) is a compact group,
the maximal compact subgroup SO(7) ⊂GL(7, R) that is a symmetry of the naive
Lagrangian ought to be a subgroup of the SU(8) R-symmetry. Indeed there is a
subgroup SO(7) ⊂SU(8) such that the 70 decomposes as
70 →1 + 27 + 35 + 7,
(2.92)
corresponding precisely to the scalars introduced above: ϕ, Mmn, Cijk and Φi,
respectively.
The various other ﬁelds obtained from the dimensional reduction of D = 11 to
D = 4 also assemble into SU(8) representations. This is easy to see at the on-shell
level where the D = 11 ﬁelds furnish representations of the little group SO(9)ST;
reduction to D = 4 simply corresponds to splitting SO(9) ⊃SO(2) × SO(7) to give
the D = 4 little group SO(2) ∼= U(1)ST and the internal SO(7) symmetry. The
resulting representations then assemble into precisely those of SU(8) × U(1)ST given
in (2.40) – see Table 2.1.
Returning to the 70 scalars, one might guess that they belong to a larger coset
G/ SU(8), where G is a non-compact group whose maximal compact subgroup is
SU(8) – just as the 28 scalars descended from the metric belonged to the coset
GL(7, R)/ SO(7), where SO(7) is the maximal compact subgroup of GL(7, R). This
would mean that
dim[G] −dim[SU(8)] = dim[G] −63 = 70,
(2.93)
so G must be a non-compact group of dimension 133. There is only one simple
Lie group of this dimension whose maximal compact subgroup is SU(8): the excep-
tional group E7(7). Indeed it can be shown that the scalars of N = 8 supergravity

parameterise the 70-dimensional coset E7(7)/ SU(8) and thus their kinetic terms have
a global non-linearly realised E7(7) symmetry. In the context of M-theory and its
brane solutions, this symmetry is seen as a discrete subgroup E7(7)(Z) called the
U-duality group. However, throughout this thesis the term ‘U-duality’ will be used
mainly to refer to the continuous global symmetry groups of classical supergravity
theories.
In general the U-duality group is not a symmetry of the whole Lagrangian, only
of the equations of motion and the Bianchi identities. For example, there are 28
vector ﬁelds in N = 8 supergravity – Ai
µ coming from the metric and Cµij coming
from the 3-form – but the smallest representation of E7(7) is the 56.
The E7(7)
transformation actually rotates the 28 vector ﬁelds’ equations of motion into their
28 Bianchi identities as the 56, generalising electromagnetic duality.

such symmetry enhancements occur when reducing down from eleven dimensions.
The ﬁrst case is D = 8 where there are six scalars descended from the metric

GL(3, R)/ SO(3) coset expected from pure gravity, the seven scalars turn out to
parameterise the coset (SL(3, R) × SL(2, R)) / (SO(3) × SO(2)). Similar enhance-
ments occur for D ≤8 all the way down to D = 3 where the coset is E8(8)/ SO(16)
– see Table 2.2 for the complete list of cosets G/H, where G is a (maximally) non-
compact group and H its maximal compact subgroup. Note that in each case the
maximal compact subgroup H is also the R-symmetry group.

3. The Normed Division Algebras
The real numbers are the dependable breadwinner of the
family, the complete ordered ﬁeld we all rely on. The complex numbers are a slightly ﬂashier but
still respectable younger brother: not ordered, but algebraically complete. The quaternions, being
non-commutative, are the eccentric cousin who is shunned at important family gatherings. But the
octonions are the crazy old uncle nobody lets out of the attic: they are non-associative.
– John Baez, The Octonions
This purely mathematical chapter is dedicated to the normed division algebras
and their deep relationship with group theory. It loosely follows the treatment in
the excellent review [1] by Baez, but often uses – in that author’s words – the
‘index-ridden’ notation favoured by most physicists.
Section 3.1 contains the deﬁnition of the division algebras and a detailed intro-
duction to their basic properties, as well as a proof that they are indeed normed
division algebras. Next, Section 3.2 describes the close connection between the di-
vision algebras and the orthogonal groups that act naturally upon them, which in
Section 3.3 is discussed in relation to the notion of triality. The ﬁnal two Sections,
3.4 and 3.5, review the broader relationship between division algebras and classical
Lie groups and their Lie algebras.
3.1. Deﬁnitions and Basic Properties
An algebra A is a vector space equipped with a bilinear multiplication rule and a
unit element. We say A is a division algebra if, given x, y ∈A with xy = 0, then
either x = 0 or y = 0. A normed division algebra is an algebra A equipped with a
positive-deﬁnite norm satisfying the condition that the norm of a product xy is the
product of the respective norms of x and y,
∥xy∥= ∥x∥∥y∥.
(3.1)
One may see from setting ∥xy∥= 0 that (3.1) also implies that A is a division
algebra, since the norm of any element is zero if and only if that element is itself
43

zero. From now on in this thesis, the terms ‘division algebra’ and ‘normed division
algebra’ shall be used interchangeably, since the division algebras that arise will
always be normed unless stated otherwise.
Although condition (3.1) might not seem so stringent, there is a remarkable the-
orem due to Hurwitz [45], which states that there are only four normed division
algebras: the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, the quaternions H and the
octonions O – with dimensions n = 1, 2, 4 and 8, respectively.
Searching for a generalisation of the complex numbers, Hamilton discovered the
quaternions H in 1853. A quaternion is a linear combination of the basis vectors
{1, i, j, k}, where the three ‘imaginary’ units i, j and k are all square roots of −1,
i2 = −1,
j2 = −1,
k2 = −1,
(3.2)
and they satisfy the associative, non-commutative multiplication rule
ij = −ji = k.
(3.3)
It follows that cyclic permutations i →j →k →· · · of the above equation also
hold. The rule may be neatly summarised using the notation e1 = i, e2 = j, e3 = k:
eiej = −δij + εijkek,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.4)
where εijk is the permutation symbol with ε123 = 1. This is reminiscent of the algebra
of the three-dimensional vector cross product, or (up to a factor of i) equivalent to
that of the Pauli spin matrices σi:
σiσj = δij1 + iεijkσk,
i = 1, 2, 3,
(3.5)
where as usual
σ1 =
 
0
1

0
!
,
σ2 =
 
0
−i
i
0
!
σ3 =
 
1
0
0
−1
!
.
(3.6)
Evidently the Pauli matrices give a complex representation of the quaternion algebra
with ei →−iσi. It makes sense that H can be represented by matrices, since it is
an associative algebra.
Inspired by Hamilton’s quaternions, later in 1853 Graves discovered the octonions
O with basis {1, e1, e2, · · · , e7}, equipped with the multiplication rule
eiej = −δij + Cijkek,
i = 1, · · · , 7,
(3.7)
44

where the totally antisymmetric tensor Cijk is deﬁned by
Cijk = C[ijk] :=



1 if ijk ∈L := {124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713},
0 if σ(ijk) /∈L for any permutation σ.
(3.8)
The Kronecker delta term in equation (3.7) says that each ei squares to −1, while
the Cijk term encodes relations such as
e1e2 = −e2e1 = e4,
(3.9)
as well as all other possible multiplications, listed in Table 3.1. Note that any subal-
gebra of O spanned by {e0, ei, ej, ek} with ijk ∈L is isomorphic to the quaternions
(this is apparent in equation (3.9) for the case ijk = 124). This will be important
for the dimensional reductions carried out in Chapter 4.
Figure 3.1.: The oriented Fano plane FO (image from [1]).
Each oriented line corresponds to
a quaternionic subalgebra.
For example, e1e2 = e4 and cyclic permutations; odd
permutations go against the direction of the arrows, giving a sign, e.g. e2e1 = −e4. It
is useful to remember that adding 1 (modulo 7) to each of the digits labelling a line
in L produces the next line. For example, 124 →235.
The set L can be viewed as the seven oriented lines of a discrete space called the
oriented Fano plane FO – see Fig. 3.1. This is constructed from the (unoriented)
Fano plane F, which is the projective plane over the ﬁnite ﬁeld with two elements,
Z2 = {0, 1}. In other words F, which one could call (Z2)P2, consists of undirected
lines through the origin (0, 0, 0) in (Z2)3 and thus has seven points and seven lines.
The seven lines are represented in the ﬁgure by the three sides of the equilateral
triangle, its three bisectors and the single central circle. Each point lies on three
lines and each line contains three points. Assigning the seven lines the orientations
shown in Fig. 3.1 deﬁnes the oriented Fano plane FO, which may be used as a as a
mnemonic for octonionic multiplication.

Table 3.1.: The multiplication table of the seven imaginary basis octonions.
A brief inspection of the Fano plane reveals that the octonions are non-associative,
but they do exhibit a similar, weaker property called alternativity. An algebra A is
alternative if and only if for all x, y ∈A the following relations are satisﬁed:
(xx)y = x(xy),
(xy)x = x(yx),
(yx)x = y(xx)
(3.10)
(note that in fact any one of these conditions may be derived from the remaining
two [1]). This property is trivially satisﬁed by the three associative division algebras
R, C and H, and therefore all division algebras are alternative. This turns out to be
crucial for supersymmetry in D = 3, 4, 6, 10, as will be demonstrated in Chapter 4.
The three conditions (3.10) can be neatly summed up by deﬁning a trilinear map
called the associator given by
[x, y, z] := (xy)z −x(yz),
x, y, z ∈A,
(3.11)
which measures the failure of associativity. An algebra A is then alternative if and
only if the associator is an antisymmetric function of its three arguments, since
setting any two of the arguments to be equal then yields one of the three conditions
in (3.10).
Sometimes it will be useful to denote the division algebra of dimension n by
An. From the above discussion, it is clear that the division algebra An contains
An/2 as a subalgebra (excluding the n = 1 case).
This is no coincidence.
The
four division algebras can be constructed, one-by-one, using the so-called ‘Cayley-
Dickson doubling’ method, starting with R; the complex numbers are pairs of real
numbers equipped with a particular multiplication rule, quaternions are pairs of
complex numbers and octonions are pairs of quaternions. At the level of vector
46

spaces,
C ∼= R2,
H ∼= C2 ∼= R4,
O ∼= H2 ∼= C4 ∼= R8.
(3.12)
The real numbers are ordered, commutative and associative, but with each doubling
one such property is lost: C is commutative and associative, H is associative, O
is non-associative.
The Cayley-Dickson procedure yields an inﬁnite sequence of
algebras, but in doubling the octonions to obtain the 16-dimensional ‘sedenions’
both alternativity and the division algebra property are lost.
It will be useful to introduce some general notation here for working with all
four division algebras. A division algebra element x ∈An is written as a linear
combination of the n basis elements with real coeﬃcients: x = xaea, xa ∈R and
a = 0, · · · , (n −1). The ﬁrst basis element e0 = 1 is ‘real’1, while the remaining
(n −1) basis elements ei are ‘imaginary’:
e2
0 = 1,
e2
i = −1,
(3.13)
where i = 1, · · · , (n−1). By analogy with the complex case, we deﬁne a conjugation
operation indicated by *, which is a linear involution that changes the sign of the
imaginary basis elements:
e0
∗= e0,
ei
∗= −ei.
(3.14)
It is natural then to deﬁne the linear projections
Re(x) := 1
2(x + x∗) = x0,
Im(x) := 1
2(x −x∗) = xiei,
(3.15)
for x ∈A. Note that this diﬀers slightly with the convention typically used for
the complex numbers (since Im(x0 + x1e1) = x1e1 rather than just x1). A division
algebra element is said to be ‘real’ if it belongs to the subspace Re(A) ∼= R or
‘imaginary’ if it belongs to Im(A).
The multiplication rule for the imaginary basis elements of a general division
1Following the tradition favoured for complex numbers, authors often take the liberty of not
distinguishing between the basis element e0, which is a vector, and the number 1, which is of
course an element of R, the ﬁeld over which the vectors are deﬁned. In practice this is always
legitimate, since e0 is the multiplicative identity.
47

algebra is:
eiej = −δij + Aijkek.
(3.16)
where the tensor Aijk is totally antisymmetric, reﬂecting anti-commutativity. The
antisymmetry of Aijk means all of its components are identically zero for A = R, C.
For the quaternions Aijk = εijk, while for the octonions Aijk = Cijk:
Aijk(A) =









0
for A = R, C,
εijk
for A = H,
Cijk
for A = O.
(3.17)
It is clear from (3.16) that the commutator of two imaginary basis elements is
[ei, ej] = 2Aijkek,
(3.18)
which shows that when A is a non-commutative algebra, i.e. A = H, O, the subspace
Im(A) forms a closed algebra under commutation. In fact, (3.18) shows that Im(H)
under the commutator is just the Lie algebra su(2) ∼= so(3), since Aijk(H) = εijk.
This is exactly what one would expect given that the imaginary quaternions can be
represented by the Pauli matrices, which are of course the generators of su(2). Note
also that the ordinary vector cross product in R3 ∼= Im(H) is just ei × ej = 1
2[ei, ej].
Including e0 = 1, the multiplication rule can be summarised as
eaeb = (+δa0δbc + δ0bδac −δabδ0c + Aabc) ec =: Γa
bcec,
(3.19)
where the deﬁnition of Aijk is extended to Aabc, which is totally antisymmetric with
A0ab = 0, and the structure constants Γa
bc are deﬁned2 as
Γa
bc := δa0δbc + δb0δac −δabδc0 + Aabc.
(3.20)
These will have an important role to play in the next section. Taking the ab = ij
components of (3.19) returns the simpler pure-imaginary version of the rule, given
in (3.16). Note that
e∗
aeb = (+δa0δbc −δ0bδac + δabδ0c −Aabc) ec =: ¯Γa
bcec,
eae∗
b = (−δa0δbc + δ0bδac + δabδ0c −Aabc) ec = ¯Γc
abec,
(3.21)
2The choice of index structure is for later convenience – see equations (3.96) and (3.102).
48

where
¯Γa
cb := Γa
bc.
(3.22)
Using (3.19) one can easily verify that conjugation of a product of x, y ∈A gives
(xy)∗= y∗x∗.
(3.23)
Again, just as for the complex numbers, the norm ||x|| of a division algebra element
x may be deﬁned as:
||x||2 = xx∗= x∗x = xaxa.
(3.24)
This norm provides the notion of ‘division’ that gives these algebras their name;
each element x has a multiplicative inverse
x−1 := x∗
x∗x
⇒
x−1x = xx−1 = 1.
(3.25)
In general, for any normed vector space, the polarisation identity gives a natural
inner product constructed from the norm [1]:
⟨x|y⟩:= 1
2
 ∥x + y∥2 −∥x∥2 −∥y∥2
= 1
2 (xy∗+ yx∗) = 1
2 (x∗y + y∗x) = xaya,
i.e.
⟨ea|eb⟩= δab.
(3.26)
This is just the canonical inner product on Rn, which is preserved by the orthogonal
group O(n). This group and its Lie algebra thus have a natural action on the division
algebra elements that will be explored in detail in the next section.
The proof that the normed division algebra condition (3.1) is satisﬁed contains
several identities that will be used throughout this work and so will be demonstrated
here. The calculation requires careful consideration for the non-associativity of the
octonions, so some discussion of the practicalities of this is beneﬁcial. For a product
such as (xy)z, with x, y, z ∈O, the brackets may be moved at the cost of adding an
associator term,
(xy)z = x(yz) + [x, y, z].
(3.27)
The properties of the associator often render this term benign. It clearly vanishes
if one if its arguments is real,
[x0, y, z] = 0 for x0 ∈Re(O) ∼= R,
(3.28)
so the associator actually only takes into account the imaginary parts of its argu-
49

ments:
[x, y, z] = [Im(x), Im(y), Im(z)].
(3.29)
Thus conjugation of any one of its arguments has the eﬀect of changing the sign,
[x∗, y, z] = [x, y∗, z] = [x, y, z∗] = −[x, y, z],
(3.30)
which, when combined with alternativity, shows that the associator is always pure-
imaginary:
[x, y, z]∗= ((xy)z)∗−(x(yz))∗
= z∗(y∗x∗) −(z∗y∗)x∗
= −[z∗, y∗, x∗]
= +[z, y, x]
= −[x, y, z]
⇔
Re ([x, y, z]) = 0.
(3.31)
This also implies that the associator of an octonion x and its conjugate x∗vanishes:
[x, x∗, z] = −[x, x, z] ≡0.
(3.32)
Now, returning to the proof that the norm satisﬁes (3.1), consider x, y ∈A, where
A = R, C, H, O. Their product xy ∈A has norm-squared ∥xy∥2 given by
(xy)(xy)∗= (xy)(y∗x∗),
(3.33)
using (xy)∗= y∗x∗. Since (xy)(y∗x∗) is a real number, it is equal to its real part,
(xy)(y∗x∗) = Re ((xy)(y∗x∗)) .
(3.34)
The brackets can be moved using the associator:
Re ((xy)(y∗x∗)) = Re (x(y(y∗x∗))) + Re ([x, y, (y∗x∗)])
= Re (x(y(y∗x∗))) ,
(3.35)
since the associator is imaginary. Then, by (3.32), y(y∗x∗) = (yy∗)x∗, but since
(yy∗) is real it may be moved through any brackets. Putting all of this together,
(xy)(xy)∗= Re (x(y(y∗x∗))) = Re (x((yy∗)x∗)))
= Re(xx∗)(yy∗)
= (xx∗)(yy∗).
(3.36)
50

Thus the product of the norms is the norm of the product, as required. Note that
this proof relies on the alternativity of the division algebras, and thus would fail for
the 16-dimensional sedenions, which are non-alternative.
For the discussion of the relationships between the division algebras and various
Lie groups, it will be helpful to present a few more deﬁnitions and identities for
working with octonions and their components.
The complement of a line in the Fano plane is called a quadrangle. Thus the Fano
plane has seven points, seven lines and seven quadrangles. Just as multiplication
of the octonionic basis elements is encoded in the oriented lines of the Fano plane,
the associator of three octonionic basis elements is encoded in its seven oriented
quadrangles:
[ea, eb, ec] = 2Qabcded,
(3.37)
where the tensor Qabcd is totally antisymmetric with Q0abc = 0, and the non-trivial
Qijkl are given by:
Qijkl = Q[ijkl] =



1 if ijkl ∈Q = {3567, 4671, 5712, 6123, 7234, 1345, 2456},
0 if σ(ijkl) /∈Q for any permutation σ.
(3.38)
Since a quadrangle is the complement of a line in the Fano plane, by deﬁnition, the
tensors Qijkl and Cijk are dual to one another in seven dimensions:
Qijkl = −1
3!εijklmnpCmnp,
(3.39)
with ε1234567 = 1. The tensors Qijkl and Cijk are also related by various identities
that can be derived by carefully considering the Fano plane [46] (or by brute-force
computation, according to taste):
CijmCklm = δikδjl −δilδjk + Qijkl,
CijnQklmn = 3(Ci[klδm]j −Cj[klδm]i),
QijklQmnpl = 6δ[i
mδj
nδk]
p −CijkCmnp + 9Q[ij
[mnδk]
p].
(3.40)
Note that, by convention, division-algebraic indices are raised and lowered with the
Kronecker delta, so the upper index placement in the ﬁnal formula is only a matter
of notational convenience, i.e. Qijkl = Qijkl.
51

3.1.1. Exponentials and Polar Form
One can deﬁne the exponential of x ∈A using the power series deﬁnition,
ex :=
∞
X
m=0
xm
m!.
(3.41)
In the octonionic case non-associativity does not stop one from deﬁning xm unam-
biguously, since all products of m copies of x are equivalent by alternativity. Now
consider any non-zero x ∈A = H, O and write it as a sum of its real and imaginary
parts, x = Re(x) + Im(x). Its norm is then
∥x∥2 = Re(x)2 + ∥Im(x)∥2,
(3.42)
One may parameterise these two terms using an angle θ ∈[0, 2π], deﬁned by
θ := tan−1
∥Im(x)∥
Re(x)

,
(3.43)
which is of course chosen such that
Re(x) = ∥x∥cos θ,
∥Im(x)∥= ∥x∥sin θ.
(3.44)
Now, as a vector, the imaginary part Im(x) can easily be rewritten
Im(x) = Im(x)
∥x∥
∥Im(x)∥
∥Im(x)∥
∥x∥
= ∥x∥u sin θ,
u :=
Im(x)
∥Im(x)∥,
(3.45)
where u manifestly has unit norm. Putting this together, the division algebra ele-
ment x is just
x = ∥x∥(cos θ + u sin θ) .
(3.46)
This looks very similar to Euler’s formula for complex numbers, but with the complex
unit i replaced by u. However, just like i, any unit-norm imaginary division algebra
element u also squares to −1:
u2 = uiei ujej = uiuj(−δij + Aijkek) = −uiui = −1,
(3.47)
since uiuj is symmetric under the interchange i ↔j while Aijk is antisymmetric.
Thus Euler’s formula applies as usual and x may be written in polar form
x = ∥x∥euθ.
(3.48)
52

This shows that a non-zero division algebra element may be expressed by a positive
real number ∥x∥, an imaginary axis u and an angle θ. There is a helpful geometrical
interpretation of this parameterisation: the real axis and the u axis are orthogonal
to one another, and since u2 = −1, they deﬁne a complex plane C ⊂A on which
x = ∥x∥euθ is just the usual complex polar form; on this plane ∥x∥is the modulus
while θ is the angle x makes with the real axis.
Equation (3.48) shows that a division algebra element has unit norm if and only
if it may be written as eα for some α ∈Im(A) (excluding the real case). Thus the
identity (3.48) can also be thought of simply as the statement that any non-zero
x ∈An can be written as a product of its norm ∥x∥∈R+ and a unit element
euθ ∈Sn−1, where Sn−1 is the unit sphere in An. More symbolically,
An −{0} ∼= Sn−1 × R+.
(3.49)
Since Im(H) ∼= su(2), a simple corollary of the above is the well-known fact that the
group SU(2) must be isomorphic to the 3-sphere,
SU(2) ∼= esu(2) ∼= eIm(H) ∼= S3,
(3.50)
as is readily checked from the deﬁnition of SU(2) as 2×2 unitary matrices with unit
determinant.
3.2. Orthogonal Groups and Cliﬀord Algebras
3.2.1. Symmetries of the Norm
As mentioned in the previous section, the norm of a division algebra element
x∗x = xx∗= xaxa,
x ∈An,
(3.51)
is manifestly invariant under
xa →Oa
bxb,
(3.52)
where Oab ∈O(n) is an orthogonal matrix. However, it is both enlightening and
useful to express these rotations in terms of division-algebraic operations such as
the multiplication rule deﬁned on An.
Beginning with the trivial case, for the reals the O(1) ∼= Z2 symmetry just cor-
responds to the symmetry under multiplication by the unit-norm elements {1, −1},
i.e. x →±x.
53

For any of the division algebras with n > 1, the full rotation group O(n) has two
connected components: the group of orientation-preserving rotations SO(n) (i.e.
determinant +1) and the component consisting of orientation-reversing reﬂections
(i.e. determinant −1). In terms of division-algebraic operations, conjugation x →x∗
is clearly a discrete orientation-reversing symmetry of the norm (3.51). Thus any
reﬂection in O(n) is a product of a rotation in SO(n) and conjugation x →x∗. The
remaining question then is how to write a general element of SO(n) purely in terms
of the multiplication rule of An.
Of course for the complex numbers SO(2) ∼= U(1) acts again as multiplication by
arbitrary elements of C with unit norm:
x →eiθx,
θ ∈R.
(3.53)
Or at the Lie algebra level, i.e. for small θ,
δx = iθx.
(3.54)
It is clear that this preserves the squared norm (3.51).
The quaternionic analogue with SO(4) acting on H follows closely. It is easy to
see that the norm is preserved under multiplication of x from both the left and right
by arbitrary unit-norm quaternions, which may be parameterised as e−θ+ and eθ−
with θ± imaginary:
x →e−θ+xeθ−,
θ+, θ−∈Im(H).
(3.55)
This means that at the Lie algebra level
δx = −θ+x + xθ−.
(3.56)
In fact, any SO(4) transformation may be written in this way. As can be veriﬁed us-
ing the quaternionic multiplication rule, an arbitary SO(4) rotation with parameters
θab = −θba is enacted by choosing
θ+ = 1
2
 θ0i + 1
2εijkθjk
ei,
θ−= 1
2
 −θ0i + 1
2εijkθjk
ei.
(3.57)
It is instructive to examine these transformations in a little more detail. Equation
(3.56) shows that the Lie algebra so(4) is isomorphic to two copies of Im(H): one for
left-multiplication by −θ+ and one for right-multiplication by θ−. Furthermore, they
commute because left- and right-multiplication commute in H, i.e. H is associative.
54

Thus
so(4) ∼= Im(H) ⊕Im(H) ∼= su(2) ⊕su(2).
(3.58)
This is a reﬂection of the fact that any antisymmetric 4 × 4 matrix θab ∈so(4) can
be split into its self-dual and anti-self-dual parts θab
+ and θab
−:
θab
± := 1
2(θab ± 1
2εabcdθcd)
⇒
1
2εabcdθcd
± = ±θab
± ,
(3.59)
which each have only three independent components (rather than six) since they
obey
θ0i
± = ±1
2εijkθjk
± = 1
2
 θ0i ± 1
2εijkθjk
.
(3.60)
It is easy to check that the sets of self-dual and anti-self-dual matrices not only com-
mute with one another, respectively, but each forms a closed subalgebra isomorphic
to su(2). With this in mind the particular expressions for θ+ and θ−in (3.56) make
sense: θ+ = θ0i
+ei corresponds to the su(2) generated by the self-dual part, while
θ−= θ0i
−ei corresponds to the su(2) generated by the anti-self-dual part. Returning
to the transformation at the ﬁnite group level, the SO(4) action x →e−θ+xeθ−is
speciﬁed by a pair of unit quaternions (e−θ+, eθ−) ∈S3 × S3 ∼= SU(2)2, but since the
pairs (e−θ+, eθ−) and (−e−θ+, −eθ−) induce the same SO(4) transformation, SU(2)2
must be the double cover of SO(4), i.e. SU(2)2 ∼= Spin(4).
Due to non-associativity the octonionic case is a little more complicated, but it
leads to some interesting considerations. In any normed division algebra A, by the
deﬁning condition ∥xy∥= ∥x∥∥y∥, multiplying x from the left and right by any
unit-norm elements eα and eβ clearly preserves the norm
∥eα(xeβ)∥= ∥(eαx)eβ∥= ∥eα∥∥x∥∥eβ∥= ∥x∥.
(3.61)
Along with conjugation x →x∗this exhausted the symmetries of the norm for
R, C, H. However, for O left- and right-multiplication by unit elements eα and eβ
gives a set of symmetries isomorphic (up to a sign) to a pair of 7-spheres, S7 × S7,
but these do not close to form a group; for the octonions there are symmetries of
the norm that arise from non-associativity and hence cannot be written in such
a simple form. Since S7 × S7 is 14-dimensional and the total unimodular norm-
preserving group is SO(8), with dimension 28, the remaining symmetries must also
be 14-dimensional.
These are the automorphisms of the octonions, forming the
exceptional group G2, which will be introduced in the following.
55

3.2.2. Automorphisms and Derivations
The automorphisms Aut(A) of an algebra A are the group of linear transformations
g : A →A that preserve multiplication in A:
g(xy) = g(x)g(y),
x, y ∈A.
(3.62)
For the normed division algebra An, the automorphisms leave real elements x0
invariant, since by linearity
g(x0y) = x0g(y),
x0 ∈Re(An) ∼= R,
(3.63)
but by deﬁnition
g(x0y) = g(x0)g(y),
(3.64)
so that multiplying on the right by g(y)−1 gives
g(x0) = x0.
(3.65)
This means that for the real numbers Aut(R) ∼= 1 is the trivial group. Furthermore
this shows that in a general division algebra automorphisms preserve the norm since
the norm is real:
g(x∗x) = g(x∗)g(x) = g(x)∗g(x) = x∗x
⇔
∥g(x)∥= ∥x∥.
(3.66)
In other words Aut(An) is a subgroup of O(n). More speciﬁcally, since the real
part of a division algebra element is invariant under automorphisms, Aut(An) is a
subgroup of the O(n −1) group that acts only on the imaginary subspace. This
means that in terms of the basis elements ei the automorphisms take the form
g(ei) = Oijej with Oij ∈O(n −1), i.e. OikOjk = δij. An automorphism is then just
an orthogonal rotation of the basis elements ei →g(ei) = Oijej such that the new
set of basis elements g(ei) satisfy the same multiplication rule (3.16) as the original
set:
g(ei)g(ej) = g(eiej),
⇔
Oikek Ojlel = −δij + Aijk Oklel.
(3.67)
For the complex numbers there is only one imaginary basis element, e1 ∼i, so
Aijk ≡0 and Aut(C) ∼= O(1) ∼= Z2 corresponding to the replacement i →−i; of
course −i squares to −1 and hence satisﬁes all that is required to do the job of i.
When Aijk ̸= 0 (i.e. when An = H, O) multiplying (3.67) by two inverse rotations
56

shows that it is satisﬁed if and only if
Oi′iOj′jOk′k Ai′j′k′ = Aijk.
(3.68)
For the quaternions Aijk = εijk so the left-hand side is proportional to the determi-
nant of O:
Oi′iOj′jOk′k εi′j′k′ = det(O) εijk = εijk,
(3.69)
which is satisﬁed only for det(O) = +1. Thus Aut(H) ∼= SO(3). To see how these
transformations act on an arbitrary quaternion x, note that the subgroup of SO(4)
matrices that leave the Re(H) subspace invariant is just those with Lie algebra
parameters θ0i = 0. Equations (3.55), (3.56) and (3.57) then give
x →e−θxeθ
⇔
δx = [x, θ],
θ ∈Im(H),
(3.70)
since θ0i = 0 implies θ−= θ+ =: θ in (3.57). This clearly transforms the imaginary
components xi as the adjoint of SO(3), i.e. as an ordinary spatial 3-vector. Because
these transformations are just a special case of the left- and right-multiplications by
unit elements discussed above, Aut(H) gives no new contribution to the symmetries
of the quaternionic norm.
For the octonions the structure tensor Aijk becomes Cijk and it is less clear which
matrices will satisfy (3.68). Unlike those of the quaternions, the automorphisms of
the octonions Aut(O) =: G2 give new norm-preserving transformations that can-
not be written as simple left- and right-multiplications.
But what do these G2
transformations look like and how does one perform them? This question is easier
to answer at the inﬁnitesimal level, where automorphisms become the Lie algebra
der(A) := aut(A) of derivations.
A derivation of an algebra A is a linear transformation d : A →A such that
d(xy) = xd(y) + d(x)y,
x, y ∈A.
(3.71)
Exponentiating this equation with g = ed recovers the ﬁnite version (3.62). For a
division algebra An, writing Oij = (eθ)ij with θij = −θji an arbitrary so(n −1)
matrix, equation (3.68) becomes
δAijk = θilAljk + θjlAilk + θklAijl = 0
(3.72)
for small θ. Thus der(An) is the subalgebra of so(n−1) consisting of antisymmetric
matrices θij satisfying (3.72).
57

For the octonions, Aijk = Cijk, so der(O) ∼= g2 ⊂so(7) is the Lie algebra of
antisymmetric matrices θij such that
δCijk = θilCljk + θjlCilk + θklCijl = 0.
(3.73)
Contracting this equation with Cijm and using the ﬁrst identity in (3.40) gives
2
3
 δi[kδl]j −1
4Qijkl

θkl = θij.
(3.74)
Viewing θij as a 21-component vector (as an antisymmetric 7 × 7 matrix it has
 7
2

= 21 independent components), this can be interpreted as a projection equation
P 14
ijklθkl = θij,
where
P 14
ijkl := 2
3
 δi[kδl]j −1
4Qijkl

,
(3.75)
where P 14 is a rank-14 projection operator on the 21-dimensional vector space of
antisymmetric 7 × 7 matrices, satisfying
(P 14)2 = P 14
⇔
P 14
ijklP 14
klmn = P 14
ijmn.
(3.76)
That P 14 is rank-14 may be seen as follows.
As a 21 × 21 matrix, P 14 is real
and symmetric – P 14
ijkl = P 14
klij – and therefore may be diagonalised by an SO(21)
transformation. Because it is a projector its diagonalised entries will each be equal
to either 1 or 0. Thus its trace is equal to its rank:
rank(P 14) = Tr(P 14) = δi[kδl]jP 14
ijkl = 2
3 × 21 = 14.
(3.77)
In other words θij a priori has 21 components, but P 14 projects out 7 of these,
leaving 14 = dim[G2].
It is now easy to write down the generators of G2 in terms of those of SO(7).
The SO(7) generators J[ij] are labelled3 by the antisymmetric pair of indices [ij] and
an SO(7) transformation with parameters θij is enacted by the linear combination
1
2θijJ[ij]. In the deﬁning 7 representation of SO(7) the generators J[ij] are the 7 × 7
matrices
(J[ij])kl = 2δi[kδl]j,
(3.78)
since a 7-vector xi transforms as
δxi = 1
2θkl(J[kl])ijxj = θklδi[kδl]jxj = θijxj.
(3.79)
3I adopt the notation of writing antisymmetric generator labels in square brackets to distinguish
them from the generator components.
58

If the parameters θij satisfy equation (3.75) then this is a G2 transformation. In
that case
1
2θijJ[ij] = 1
2θijP 14
ijklJ[kl] = 1
2θijP 14
ijklP 14
klmnJ[mn],
(3.80)
from which one can see that G2 has generators (G[ij])kl given by the linear combi-
nations
(G[ij])kl := P 14
ijmn(J[mn])kl = 4
3
 δi[kδl]j −1
4Qijkl

.
(3.81)
Thus under G2 ⊂SO(7), the vector transforms as
δxi = 1
2θkl(G[kl])ijxj = 2
3θkl  δi[kδl]j −1
4Qijkl

xj.
(3.82)
This is the deﬁning 7 representation of G2.
Finally, this can be used to ﬁnd the explicit form of the derivations of the octonions
in terms of the multiplication rule in O. This makes use of the commutator and the
associator, since they satisfy the identities
[ei, ej] = 2Cijkek
and
[ei, ej, ek] = 2Qijklel.
(3.83)
It is then easy to verify that the following particular combination gives the correct
action of the G2 generators G[ij]:
bG[ij] x := 1
2[ei, ej, x] −1
6 [[ei, ej], x] = (G[ij])klxl ek.
(3.84)
where in general a ‘hat’ denotes a linear operator on O. This means that any pair
of imaginary octonions y1, y2 ∈Im(O) generates a unique derivation, since one can
simply contract the free indices in equation (3.84) with arbitrary components yi
1, yj
2:
bdy1,y2 x := 1
2[y1, y2, x] −1
6 [[y1, y2], x] .
(3.85)
Furthermore, since any derivation may be written as a linear combination of the
generators G[ij], any derivation must take the form (3.85) for some y1, y2 ∈Im(O).
This gives another way to see the dimension of G2; it takes 7 + 7 = 14 parameters
to specify the two imaginary octonions required to deﬁne a derivation.
Returning to the symmetries of the norm, the full so(8) can now be realised in
terms of octonions using derivations, combined with left- and right-multiplication by
imaginary octonions α, β ∈Im(O). This corresponds to the decomposition SO(8) ⊃
G2:
28 →14 + 7 + 7,
(3.86)
59

with the 14 corresponding to derivations and the two 7s corresponding to α and β.
For an SO(8) transformation parameterised by the antisymmetric matrix θab ∈so(8):
δx = bdx + αx + xβ,
⇔
δxa = θabxb
(3.87)
where
bd = 1
2θij bG[ij],
α =
 −1
2θ0i −1
12Cijkθjk
ei,
β =
 −1
2θ0i + 1
12Cijkθjk
ei. (3.88)
Due to non-associativity, exponentiating (3.87) to obtain a ﬁnite SO(8) transforma-
tion must be approached carefully. One fool-proof way to achieve this is to deﬁne
operators that multiply from the left and right,
bLα x := αx
bRβ x := xβ,
(3.89)
so that δx may be written
δx = (bd + bLα + bRβ)x.
(3.90)
Now bLα, bRβ and bd are just linear transformations of R8 ∼= O, so their composition
is by deﬁnition associative. This means they may be exponentiated as usual and
the ﬁnite SO(8) transformation is
x →e
bd+bLα+ bRβx.
(3.91)
3.2.3. Spin(n) Spinors and Cliﬀord Algebras
So far in the above discussion on SO(n), the group of symmetries of the norm of
An, the division algebra elements have transformed in the deﬁning – or ‘vector’ –
representation of the group. However, the division algebras have an equally close
relationship with the spinor representations of Spin(n) and their associated Cliﬀord
algebras. To see this, consider an arbitrary division algebra element ψ ∈An, and
multiply it by the basis elements as follows (for n > 1):
e∗
a(ebψ) + e∗
b(eaψ) =
 Γa
cd¯Γb
de + Γb
cd¯Γa
de

ψe ec,
(3.92)
where the structure constants Γa
bc and ¯Γa
bc are deﬁned by the division-algebraic mul-
tiplication rules
eaeb = Γa
bcec,
e∗
aeb = ¯Γa
bcec.
(3.93)
60

Moving both sets of brackets on the left-hand side of (3.92) costs a pair of associators,
but they cancel with one another due to alternativity:
e∗
a(ebψ) + e∗
b(eaψ) = (e∗
aeb)ψ + (e∗
bea)ψ.
(3.94)
The ﬁnal line here can be factorised and then gives a Kronecker delta, since it is
proportional to the inner product of the basis elements:
(e∗
aeb + e∗
bea)ψ = 2⟨ea|eb⟩ψ = 2δabψ.
(3.95)
Comparing (3.92) and (3.95) shows – perhaps surprisingly – that Γa
bc and ¯Γa
bc are
actually n × n ‘gamma matrices’ satisfying the familiar relations
Γa¯Γb + Γb¯Γa = 2δab1,
¯ΓaΓb + ¯ΓbΓa = 2δab1
(3.96)
(where the second line comes from the other version of the inner product with
2⟨ea|eb⟩= eae∗
b + ebe∗
a). This means that the 2n × 2n matrices
γa =
 
0
Γa
¯Γa
0
!
(3.97)
satisfy the Spin(n) Cliﬀord algebra,
γaγb + γbγa = 2δab1,
(3.98)
and so may be used to form 2n × 2n generators of Spin(n) by the usual antisym-
metrised product
1
2γ[aγb] =
 
1
2Γ[a¯Γb]
0
0

2 ¯Γ[aΓb]

.
(3.99)
However, as these matrices are block-diagonal, this is a reducible representation
of Spin(n); it decomposes into the n × n irreducible spinor and conjugate spinor
representations, with generators [46]
Σ[ab] := 1
2Γ[a¯Γb],
¯Σ[ab] := 1
2 ¯Γ[aΓb],
(3.100)
61

whose components can be found by explicit computation using the identities (3.40):
Σ[ab]
cd = δc[aδb]d −δ0[aAb]cd + δ0[cAd]ab −1
2Qabcd + 4δ0[cδd][aδb]0,
¯Σ[ab]
cd = δc[aδb]d + δ0[aAb]cd + δ0[cAd]ab −1
2Qabcd,
(3.101)
where the Q terms vanish for n ̸= 8.
The above discussion demonstrates that multiplying a division algebra element ψ
by the basis element ea has the eﬀect of multiplying ψ’s components by the gamma
matrix ¯Γa:
eaψ = eaebψb = Γa
bcecψb = ec¯Γa
cbψb,
(3.102)
which means one can represent an irreducible spinor ψa and conjugate spinor χa of
Spin(n) using division algebra elements ψ and χ, transforming as
δψ = 1
4θabe∗
a(ebψ) = 1
2θabΣ[ab]
cd ψd ec,
δχ = 1
4θabea(e∗
bχ) = 1
2θab ¯Σ[ab]
cd χd ec.
(3.103)
These representations will be important for the fermions in the supersymmetric
theories presented in later chapters.
Looking at equations (3.103) more closely for the division algebras An with n > 1:
• For C, there is only one independent parameter θ := θ01 = −θ10, so the
transformations become simply (writing e1 as the usual complex unit i):
δψ = +1
2iθψ,
δχ = −1
2iθχ.
(3.104)
• For H, associativity means that
δψ = 1
4θab(e∗

δχ = 1
4θab(eae∗
b)χ = 1
2
 −θ0i −1
2εijkθjk
ei χ = −θ+χ,
(3.105)
where θ+ and θ−are deﬁned as in (3.57). This shows that the spinor and
conjugate spinor transform under the anti-self-dual and self-dual parts of θab,
respectively. The imaginary quaternions θ+ and θ−each generate an SU(2)
factor of the double cover of the norm-preserving group Spin(4) ∼= SU(2)2.
• For O, the transformations can once again be written in terms of derivations
62

and multiplication from the left and right:
δψ = 1
4θabe∗
a(ebψ) = bdψ −βψ + ψ(α −β),
δχ = 1
4θabea(e∗
bχ) = bdχ + αχ + χ(α −β),
(3.106)
where bd, α and β are deﬁned in equations (3.88). The derivations term is
common to the transformations of ψ, χ and x in (3.87); it is the terms in-
volving left- and right-mutliplication by various combinations of α and β that
distinguish the three representations. Another way to say this is that under
the subgroup G2 ⊂Spin(8), the vector 8v, spinor 8s and conjugate spinor 8c
all decompose in the same way, i.e.
8v →7 + 1,
8s →7 + 1,
8c →7 + 1.
(3.107)
Note that the singlet 1 in each of these decompositions corresponds to the real
part, which is invariant under G2 (so bdx0 = 0 for any x0 ∈Re(O)); as far as
G2 is concerned, the 8v, 8s and 8c are all simply octonions on equal footing.
3.3. Triality
Having seen how to transform the vector, spinor and conjugate-spinor representa-
tions of Spin(n) using division algebras, the obvious next step is to see how the three
representations are related to one another. Consider the following octonion a, using
the multiplication rule (3.19):
a := χψ∗= χb¯Γa
bcψc ea,
(3.108)
where ψ is an octonionic spinor and χ is a conjugate-spinor. As a gamma matrix
sandwiched between two spinors, this ought to transform as a vector under Spin(8)
(cf. the familiar spinor bilinear ¯χγµψ for Lorentz spinors χ, ψ). Indeed one may
verify that this is the case using the transformations (3.106). This highlights the
most elegant aspect of using division-algebraic representations of Spin(n): the rela-
tionships between the three fundamental representations may be expressed without
gamma matrices, simply using the multiplication rule. Assuming that ψ and χ have
unit norm (since this section is only concerned with their transformation properties),
63

(3.108) may be written in three equivalent forms,
a = χψ∗= χbψc¯Γa
bcea = (χT¯Γaψ)ea,
⇔
ψ = a∗χ = aaχb¯Γa
bcec = (χT/a)a ea,
⇔
χ = aψ = aaψc¯Γa
bceb = (/aψ)a ea,
(3.109)
where /a := ¯Γbab.
This further demonstrates the intimate relationship between
division-algebraic multiplication and Spin(n).
As well as transforming covariantly under Spin(n), for the associative division
algebras, equations (3.109) are also invariant under (right-)multiplication of the
spinors by an arbitrary unit-norm element u ∈An:
ψ →ψu,
χ →χu,
u∗u = 1.
(3.110)
Writing u = eθI in the complex and quaternionic cases this becomes
δψ = ψθI,
δχ = χθI,
θI ∈Im(An),
An = C, H,
(3.111)
for small θI. At the Lie algebra level this means that equations (3.109) have an
extra u(1) and su(2) symmetry for An = C, H, respectively, which can be labelled
as ex(An) = Ø, u(1), su(2), Ø, for R, C, H, O, respectively. The total Lie algebra
so(n) ⊕ex(An) combining so(n) with these extra symmetries is called the triality
algebra tri(An):
tri(R) = Ø,
tri(C) = u(1) ⊕u(1),
tri(H) = su(2) ⊕su(2) ⊕su(2),
tri(O) = so(8).
(3.112)
Intuitively speaking, it makes sense that there is no extra symmetry in the octonionic
case, since a, ψ and χ each have 8 real components and are already transforming as
the irreducible vector 8v, spinor 8s and conjugate-spinor 8c representations of so(8);
there is ‘no room’ left for them to transform under any further group action. In
contrast, for the quaternions, the vector a transforms as the (2, 2) representation of
so(4) ∼= su(2) ⊕su(2), while the quaternionic spinors ψ and χ in (3.105) each only
transform as a (2, 1) and (1, 2). Since ψ and χ have 4 real components each, there
is room for them to transform also as a 2 under the third su(2) generated by θI.
Thus the three representations transform under tri(H) = so(4) ⊕su(2), isomorphic
64

to su(2) ⊕su(2) ⊕su(2), as
a ∼(2, 2, 1),
ψ ∼(2, 1, 2),
χ ∼(1, 2, 2),
(3.113)
where the three slots in order correspond to θ+, θ−and θI.
In the mathematics literature, the triality algebras are usually introduced via a
more elegant deﬁnition, designed so as to generalise the algebra of derivations. This
is given as follows: tri(An) is the algebra of triples ( bA, bB, bC) ∈so(n)⊕so(n)⊕so(n)
such that
bA(xy) = x( bBy) + ( bCx)y,
x, y ∈An.
(3.114)
The analogy with derivations is very clear – compare (3.114) with (3.71). Note that
bA, bB and bC each belong to a diﬀerent copy of so(n), and that each transformation is
taken a priori to be in the vector representation of each of the three copies. Hence,
in terms of three sets of antisymmetric parameters θab
A , θab
B and θab
C , equation (3.114)
becomes
θab
A (xy)b ea = x θab
B yb ea + θab
C xb ea y.
(3.115)
Using the multiplication rule and factoring out the arbitrary coeﬃcients xa and ya
gives
θad
A ¯Γd
bc + θbd
B ¯Γa
dc + θcd
C ¯Γa
bd = 0.
(3.116)
Thus the triality algebras represent the overall symmetries of the structure constants
¯Γa
bc under independent rotations of each of their indices, just as derivations are the
orthogonal transformations preserving Cijk – see (3.72). Equation (3.116) relates
the parameters θab
A , θab
B and θab
C to one another, breaking so(n) ⊕so(n) ⊕so(n) to its
subalgebra tri(An), as given in (3.112).
To see how this works in terms of division-algebraic multiplication, consider the
octonionic case. Using (3.87) gives
bA(xy) = bdA(xy) + αA(xy) + (xy)βA,
bBy = bdBy + αBy + yβB,
bCx = bdCx + αCx + xβC,
(3.117)
for three independent derivations dA, dB and dC and six independent imaginary
parameters αA, αB, αC, βA, βB, βC ∈Im(O). Temporarily setting all but the deriva-
tions to zero (3.114) becomes
bdA(xy) = x(bdBy) + (bdCx)y,
(3.118)
65

but by deﬁnition any derivation must satisfy the Leibniz rule (3.71) and one must
identify bdA = bdB = bdC; the subscript can then be dropped and all three of them
simply written as bd. Temporarily setting bd = 0 and substituting the transformations
(3.117) into (3.114) gives
αA(xy) + (xy)βA = x(αB y + y βB) + (αC x + x βC)y,
(3.119)
but by alternativity,
α(xy) = (αx)y + (xα)y −x(αy),
(xy)β = x(yβ) + x(βy) −(xβ)y,
(3.120)
for any α, β, x, y ∈O. This means αB, αC, βB, βC may be eliminated, leaving only
αA and βA:
αB = −(αA −βA),
βB = βA,
αC = αA,
βC = αA −βA.
(3.121)
Dropping the A subscripts, the triple of transformations then becomes
bA(xy) = bd(xy) + α(xy) + (xy)β,
bBy = bdy −(α −β)y + yβ,
bCx = bdx + αx + x(α −β).
(3.122)
In fact, the argument above works for any of the division algebras, since orthogonal
transformations can always be written in the form (3.117). Thus the triality triple
( bA, bB, bC) is determined entirely by a derivation bd and two imaginary parameters α
and β as in (3.122), i.e.
tri(An) ∼= der(An) + Im(An) + Im(An).
(3.123)
It is easy to see that this leads to the algebras listed in (3.112) (note that derivations
are trivial for R and C).
To see how this relates to the discussion of Spin(n) representations above, simply
relabel x = χ and y = ψ∗in (3.114) so that that xy = χψ∗=: a – at this point these
66

are just labels. Then the transformations (3.122) become
δa = bAa = ˆda + αa + aβ,
δψ∗= bBψ∗=

ˆdψ −βψ + ψ(α −β)
∗
,
δχ = bCχ = ˆdχ + αχ + χ(α −β).
(3.124)
In the octonionic case these are exactly the Spin(8) transformations of the vector
a, spinor ψ and conjugate-spinor χ representations, as seen in equations (3.87) and
(3.106). The statement of triality (3.114) then becomes an identity:
δa = δ(χψ∗) = δχ ψ∗+ χ δψ∗.
(3.125)
In component form, this is equivalent to saying that (3.116) is solved by
θab
A = θab,
θab
B = 1
2θcdΣ[cd]
ab ,
θab
C = 1
2θcd ¯Σ[cd]
ab ,
(3.126)
where Σ and ¯Σ are the spinor and conjugate-spinor generators deﬁned in (3.101).
This picks out a single diagonal so(8) subalgebra in so(8) ⊕so(8) ⊕so(8), relying
on the fact that the Lie algebra elements transforming the vector aa, spinor ψa and
conjugate-spinor χa are all just 8 × 8 (real) antisymmetric matrices.
Similarly for the quaternions any derivation is generated by a commutator with
an imaginary parameter θ ∈Im(H), so
bAa = aθ −θa + αa + aβ,
bBψ∗= (ψθ −θψ −βψ + ψ(α −β))∗,
bCχ = χθ −θχ + αχ + χ(α −β).
(3.127)
Identifying
θ −α = θ+,
θ + β = θ−,
θ + α −β = θI
(3.128)
recovers the usual transformations of a, ψ and χ preserving a = χψ∗, as outlined in
the beginning of this section. A similar argument works for the complex numbers,
while the triality algebra of the reals is empty.
The triality algebras are so named because they each have a discrete symmetry
– called triality – isomorphic to the group S3 of permutations on three objects. For
An = H, O, the ﬁrst hint of these outer automorphisms4 is in the manifest symmetry
4Group automorphisms are linear mappings A of a group G onto itself such that the multiplication
rule is preserved: A(g1g2) = A(g1)A(g2), g1, g2 ∈G. Outer automorphisms are those that are
non-trivial in the sense that A(g) ̸= hgh−1 for any h ∈G. The same concept applies also at
the Lie algebra level.
67

of the su(2) ⊕su(2) ⊕su(2) and so(8) Dynkin diagrams in Fig. 3.2. Furthermore,
for any An the relationship a = χψ∗is invariant under the following representation
of S3:
 
a

χ∗
a

(3.129)
since these permutations simply result in six equivalent versions of the same relation
a = (χ∗)∗ψ∗,
ψ = a∗(χ∗)∗,
χ∗= ψ∗a∗
⇔
a∗= ψχ∗,
ψ∗= χ∗a,
χ = aψ.
(3.130)
Note that the cyclic permutations involve a, ψ and χ∗(rather than a, ψ and χ)
and that odd permutations must be accompanied by conjugating all three of these
division algebra elements.
Figure 3.2.: The Dynkin diagrams for the Lie algebras so(8) (left) and su(2)⊕su(2)⊕su(2) (right).
Clearly the three representations a, ψ and χ∗of tri(An) are isomorphic, since their
transformations
δa = bda + αa + aβ,
δψ = bdψ −βψ + ψ(α −β),
δχ∗= bdχ∗−(α −β)χ∗−χ∗α,
(3.131)
each involve a derivation, a left-multiplication by an element of Im(An) and a right-
multiplication by an element of Im(An). Thus exchanging the arbitrary parameters
α →−β,
β →α −β
⇒
α −β →−α,
(3.132)
68

results in
δa = bda −βa + a(α −β),
δψ = bdψ −(α −β)ψ −ψα,
δχ∗= bdχ∗+ αχ∗+ χ∗β,
(3.133)
so that from this perspective the vector can be seen as a spinor, while the spinor
looks like a conjugate-spinor and the conjugate-spinor like a vector. The exchange
of parameters (3.132) simply corresponds to the order-two permutation
ϑ :=
 
a
ψ
χ∗
χ∗
a
ψ
!
,
(3.134)
from (3.129). The other permutations in (3.129) can be obtained by similar param-
eter redeﬁnitions, resulting in the full S3 group of outer automorphisms. Explicitly,
letting
α →α,
β →α −β
⇒
α −β →β
(3.135)
results in the order-one odd permutation
ϱ :=
 
a
ψ
χ∗
χ
ψ∗
a∗
!
(3.136)
and the six elements of S3 are then {1, ϑ, ϑ2, ϱ, ϱϑ, ϱϑ2}.
As an aside, when constructing the exceptional groups it will be useful to deﬁne the
action of the particular elements ϑ and ϱ above in terms of the triality transformation
triple ( bA, bB, bC) in (3.122). The transformations (3.131) can be written
δa = bAa,
δψ∗= bBψ∗,
δχ = bCχ,
(3.137)
whereas the ϑ-permuted transformations (3.133) are
δa = ( bBa∗)∗,
δψ∗= bCψ∗,
δχ = ( bAχ∗)∗.
(3.138)
Thus the action of ϑ is equivalent to
ϑ : ( bA, bB, bC) 7→( bB⋆, bC, bA⋆),
(3.139)
where the ⋆of an operator is deﬁned as
ˆO⋆x := ( ˆOx∗)∗,
ˆO ∈so(n),
x ∈A.
(3.140)
69

By similar logic, one may also easily derive that the action of ϱ is equivalent to
ϱ : ( bA, bB, bC) 7→( bC, bB⋆, bA).
(3.141)
Both ϑ and ϱ will be put to use in Chapter 5.
The triality algebras ﬁnd utility in supergravity mainly through their relationship
with the exceptional groups and the magic square. Most importantly, the discrete
triality symmetry associated with the octonions is one of the fundamental ingre-
dients that allows the exceptional groups F4, E6, E7 and E8 to exist, as will be
shown in Chapter 5. The triality algebras are also the symmetries of N = 1 super
Yang-Mills theories (on-shell) in D = 3, 4, 6, 10. The various Lie algebras associated
with the division algebras that have appeared so far are summarised in Table 3.2.

The ‘extra’ algebras
ex(An) := tri(An) ⊖so(n) are the subalgebras of tri(An) that commute with so(n)
(for An = H, O there are of course three ways to embed the so(n) into tri(An), but
they are equivalent up to discrete triality transformations).
3.4. Division Algebras and Simple Lie Algebras
Above and beyond the action of the norm-preserving and triality algebras on R, C, H
and O, the division algebras have a close relationship with all simple Lie groups and
their Lie algebras. Consider the Lie group A(N, A) consisting of N × N ‘unitary’
matrices with entries in A = R, C, H:
A(N, A) :=

X ∈A[N]
 X†X = XX† = 1
	
,
(3.142)
where A[N] denotes the set of N × N matrices with entries in A and x† is the
conjugate-transpose (xT)∗. Its Lie algebra is made up of N × N anti-Hermitian
70

matrices with entries in A:
a(N, A) :=

x ∈A[N]
 x† = −x
	
,
(3.143)
The Lie brackets are taken using ordinary matrix commutation, [x, y] = xy −yx,
and despite the non-commutativity of the quaternions, the commutators satisfy the
required properties: bilinearity, antisymmetry and the Jacobi identity. In fact, for
the three diﬀerent division algebras R, C, H, this deﬁnition encompasses all of the
classical (compact) Lie algebras [47]
a(N, R) ∼= so(N),
a(N, C) ∼= u(N),
a(N, H) ∼= sp(N).
(3.144)
Aside from these inﬁnite classical families, there are only ﬁve other simple Lie al-
gebras in existence (up to diﬀerent real forms): those of the exceptional groups G2,
F4, E6, E7 and E8. The ﬁrst of these G2 was introduced earlier as the automor-
phism group of O, so one might guess that the other four exceptional groups are
also somehow related to the octonions. Indeed this turns out to be the case; just
as the octonions themselves hold an exceptional status as the largest and only non-
associative division algebra, their existence gives rise to the ﬁve exceptional groups.
These will be introduced in Chapter 5.
3.5. Complex and Quaternionic Structures
An important concept for understanding the symmetries of super Yang-Mills theories
and the magic pyramid of supergravities is the idea of a complex structure, and its
generalisation to a quaternionic structure.
A complex structure deﬁnes an embedding of CN into R2N, where N is any natural
number. This deﬁnes a corresponding embedding of C[N] into R[2N]. Consider a
vector v ∈R2N. Writing v = (x, y), with x, y ∈RN, one can identify x and y with
the real and imaginary parts of a complex vector x + iy ∈CN. Multiplying v by the
real 2N × 2N matrix
E :=
 
0
−1
1
0
!
∈R[2N],
(3.145)
which clearly satisﬁes E2 = −1, is equivalent to multiplying x + iy by i:
(x + iy) →i(x + iy) = −y + ix
⇔
v →Ev =
 
0
−1
1
0
!  
x
y
!
=
 
−y
x
!
.
(3.146)
71

For an arbitrary real 2N × 2N matrix M ∈R[2N] acting on R2N to behave like a
complex N × N matrix acting on CN, it must commute with the complex structure
matrix E. This is the purely real version of the statement that any complex matrix
commutes with multiplication by i. A quick calculation shows that if M commutes
with E then it must be of the form
M =
 
A
−B
B
A
!
,
A, B ∈R[N].
(3.147)
In this case, acting on v with M is equivalent to acting on x + iy with the matrix
A + iB ∈C[N]
(x + iy) →(A + iB)(x + iy) = (Ax −By) + i(Bx + Ay)
⇔
v →Mv =
 
A
−B
B
A
!  
x
y
!
=
 
Ax −By
Bx + Ay
!
.
(3.148)
Thus in general there is an algebra isomorphism
C[N] ∼=
n
M ∈R[2N]
[M, E] = 0, E2 = −1
o
.
(3.149)
In particular, for the Lie algebra of real antisymmetric 2N × 2N matrices so(2N),
this restricts to
u(N) ∼=
n
u ∈so(2N)
[u, E] = 0, E2 = −1, E ∈so(2N)
o
,
(3.150)
where the commuting u(1) part of u(N) ∼= su(N)⊕u(1) is generated by the complex
structure E itself.
It is straightforward to generalise this notion to that of a quaternionic structure,
which embeds H[N] into R[4N]. This is simply a pair of 4N ×4N complex structures
E1 and E2 that anti-commute with one another:
E2
1 = E2
2 = −1,
E1E2 = −E2E1 =: E3.
(3.151)
The three matrices E1, E2 and E3 then mimic the algebra of the quaternionic basis
elements i, j and k, and it is easy to prove that there is an algebra isomorphism
H[N] ∼=
n
M ∈R[4N]
[M, E1] = [M, E2] = 0
o
.
(3.152)
This time the requirement that M commutes with E1 and E2 (and hence also E3) is
the real version of the statement that left- and right-multiplication in H commute;
72

E1, E2 and E3 represent right-multiplication of a quaternionic vector in HN by i, j
and k, which commutes with left-multiplying the vector by a quaternionic matrix5.
Similarly to the complex case, for the Lie algebra of real antisymmetric 4N × 4N
matrices so(4N), the isomorphism (3.152) restricts to
sp(N) ∼=
n
u ∈so(4N)
[u, E1] = [u, E2] = 0, E1, E2 ∈so(4N)
o
.
(3.153)
The three quaternionic structure matrices E1, E2 and E3 themselves generate a copy
of sp(1) that commutes with the sp(N) above, corresponding to right-multiplication
by an imaginary quaternion.
There is no such straightforward generalisation to an ‘octonionic structure’, since
ordinary associative matrix multiplication can only represent the associative division
algebras.
5Note that E1, E2 and E3 may alternatively correspond to left-multiplication if the quaternionic
matrix is thought of as quaternionic-multiplying on the right, e.g. if the matrix

4. Super Yang-Mills, Division
Algebras and Triality
Over the years the relationship between supersymmetry and the division algebras
has been a recurring theme. See, for example, [24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 48]. In particular,
owing to the Lie algebra isomorphism
so(1, 1 + n) ∼= sl(2, An),
n = dim An = 1, 2, 4, 8,
(4.1)
the normed division algebras An = R, C, H, O provide a natural framework for de-
scribing relativistic physics in D = n + 2 = 3, 4, 6 and 10 spacetime dimensions,
which will be introduced in Section 4.1. Furthermore, the classical Green-Schwarz
superstring and N = 1 super Yang-Mills (SYM) theories of a single vector and
spinor can exist only in these dimensions [15]. In Section 4.2 this division-algebraic
language is used to give a uniﬁed formulation of these N = 1 SYM theories. A
version using division-algebraic auxiliary ﬁelds is also given so that the supersym-
metry algebra closes oﬀ-shell1 in D = 3, 4, 6, while for D = 10 the failure to close is
explicitly demonstrated to be a result of the non-associativity of the octonions, as
hinted at in [49].
Finally in Section 4.3 these theories are dimensionally reduced to give a uni-
ﬁed division-algebraic description of SYM theories with (D = 3, N = 1, 2, 4, 8),
(D = 4, N = 1, 2, 4), (D = 5, N = 1, 2), (D = 6, (N+N−) = (1, 0), (1, 1)) and
(D = 10, 9, 8, 7, N = 1). In particular the maximally supersymmetric theories in
each dimension, descended from D = 10, are formulated over the octonions and
thus the failure of the supersymmetry algebra to close in these cases is attributed
to the non-associativity of O. Consistent truncation to theories with fewer super-
symmetries then corresponds simply to ﬁnding H, C and R subalgebras of O. There
is a single ‘master Lagrangian’ for all of these theories with a single uniﬁed set of
supersymmetry transformation rules.
1Recall from Chapter 2 that the {Q, ¯Q} anti-commutator only ‘closes’ to produce a translation
after the fermionic equation of motion /Dλ = 0 has been applied, i.e. on-shell. Using unphysical
auxiliary ﬁelds the algebra can be made to close oﬀ-shell.
74

The important role of triality algebras as the symmetries of the on-shell degrees
of freedom of N = 1 SYM theories will also be discussed in Section 4.3. By deﬁning
a new algebra int in terms of the usual triality algebras, the on-shell symmetries for
super Yang-Mills with any (D, N) as above are summarised in a single formula.
4.1. Spacetime Fields in D = n + 2
The isomorphism (4.1) holds for the same reasoning commonly used in D = 4 for
so(1, 3) ∼= sl(2, C). In dimension D = n + 2 with n = 1, 2, 4, 8, a vector Xµ in
Minkowski spacetime can be represented by the components:
Xµ = (X0, X1, . . . , Xn, Xn+1) =: (t, Xa+1, z),
a = 0, 1, . . . , (n −1).
(4.2)
However, the vector can just as well be parametrised by X ∈h2(An), where h2(An)
is the set of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices [24, 50, 51, 48, 31] with entries in the division
algebra An:
X =
 
t + z
x∗
x
t −z
!
where t, z ∈R and x = Xa+1ea ∈An.
(4.3)
Then the determinant of the matrix is the Minkowski metric for D-dimensional
spacetime:
−det X = −t2 + z2 + |x|2.
(4.4)
The group of determinant-preserving transformations SL(2, An) must then be equiv-
alent to the group of Lorentz transformations, although care is needed to deﬁne el-
ements of SL(2, An) and its Lie algebra, due to the general non-commutativity and
non-associativity of An.
In D = 4 the Pauli matrices {¯σµ} are used as a basis for Hermitian matrices,
so that X = Xµ¯σµ.
This suggests a generalised set of Pauli matrices for µ =
0, 1, · · · , (n + 1). The straightforward generalisation of the usual Pauli matrices to
all four normed division algebras is the linearly-independent basis [24, 51, 29]
¯σµ = σµ = (+1, σa+1, σn+1),
or
σµ = ¯σµ = (−1, σa+1, σn+1),
(4.5)
where
σa+1 :=
 
0
e∗
a
ea
0
!
,
σn+1 :=
 
1
0
0
−1
!
.
(4.6)
75

The notation is chosen so that in D = 4 (where n = 2 and A2 = C) the matrices
reduce to the usual Pauli basis:
σ1 =
 
0
e∗
0
e0
0
!
=
 
0
1
1
0

,
σ2 =

e∗

e1
0
!
=:
 
0
−i
i
0
!
,
σ3 =
 
1
0
0
−1
!
. (4.7)
It is easy to check that the generalised Pauli matrices satisfy
σµ¯σν + σν¯σµ = 2ηµν1,
¯σµσν + ¯σνσµ = 2ηµν1.
(4.8)
This means they can be used to generate Lorentz transformations.
To see this,
consider a vector ﬁeld Aµ transforming under an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation
as
δAµ = λµ
νAν,
(4.9)
with λµρηρν = λµν = −λνµ. The vector may be contracted with the Pauli matrices
σµ or ¯σµ to give Hermitian matrices
A = Aµσµ =
 
−A0 + An+1
Aa+1e∗
a
Aa+1ea
−A0 −An+1
!
,
¯A = Aµ¯σµ =
 
+A0 + An+1
Aa+1e∗
a
Aa+1ea
+A0 −An+1
!
= A −(Tr A)1.
(4.10)
Then A transforms under Lorentz transformations as
δA = 1
4λµν
σµ(¯σνA) −A(¯σµσν)

.
(4.11)
Of course the positioning of the brackets above is only important for the octonions.
To see that equations (4.9) and (4.11) are equivalent, one may add and subtract a
term in (4.11):
δA = 1
4λµν  σµ(¯σνA) −A(¯σµσν) + σµ( ¯Aσν) −σµ( ¯Aσν)

= 1
4λµν  σµ(¯σνA + ¯Aσν) −(A¯σµ + σµ ¯A)σν

,
(4.12)
where the second line follows from alternativity. Then since
σµ ¯A + A¯σµ = Aν(σµ¯σν + σν¯σµ) = 2ηµνAν1,
¯σµA + ¯Aσµ = Aν(¯σµσν + ¯σνσµ) = 2ηµνAν1.
(4.13)
76

it follows that
δA = 1
2λµν (σµAν −σνAµ)
= σµλµ
νAν,
(4.14)
and hence by the linear independence of the sigma matrices one recovers (4.9). A
parallel argument also leads to
δ ¯A = 1
4λµν
¯σµ(σν ¯A) −¯A(σµ¯σν)

.
(4.15)
Note the similarity with the familiar SL(2, C) formalism using the Pauli matrices.
For the spinor representations, consider constructing gamma matrices in D = n+2
modeled on the Weyl basis (2.23) using the generalised Pauli matrices:
γµ =
 
0
σµ
¯σµ
0
!
,
µ = 0, · · · , (n + 1).
(4.16)
Left-multiplication by these matrices generates the Cliﬀord algebra
γµ(γνζ) + γν(γµζ) = 2ηµνζ
∀
ζ ∈(An)4,
(4.17)
and thus multiplying any 4-component ‘column-vector’ ζ valued in An by γµ has the
eﬀect of multiplying ζ’s 4n real components by an ordinary real 4n×4n gamma ma-
trix. This means that ζ may be seen as a Dirac spinor, and the spinor representation
of Spin(1, n + 1) will be given inﬁnitesimally by
δζ = 1
4λµνγµ(γνζ).
(4.18)
However, this representation is reducible; writing ζ = (Ψ, X) where Ψ, X ∈(An)2
are 2-component spinors,
δζ = δ
 
Ψ
X
!
=
 
1
4λµνσµ(¯σνΨ)
1
4λµν¯σµ(σνX)
!
.
(4.19)
Thus Ψ and X transform respectively as the irreducible left-handed spinor and
right-handed spinor representations of Spin(1, n + 1):
δΨ = 1
4λµνσµ(¯σνΨ),
δX = 1
4λµν¯σµ(σνX).
(4.20)
Again, the bracket positioning only matters in the octonionic case.
Making the
77

incorrect choice (σ[µ¯σν])Ψ, one ﬁnds that the octonionic matrices σ[µ¯σν] have only
31 independent components, rather than the required 45 = dim[SO(1, 9)].
The
14 missing generators are precisely those of G2, the automorphism group of the
octonions; this G2 subgroup is thus encoded in the non-associativity of the octonions.
Note that in D = 3, the 2 × 2 matrices
Γµ := σµε with ε :=
 
0 −1
1
0
!
(4.21)
already satisfy the Cliﬀord algebra
ΓµΓν + ΓνΓµ = 2ηµν1,
(4.22)
so using the two sets of matrices σµ and ¯σµ is not actually necessary, i.e. the spinor
and conjugate-spinor representations are isomorphic. However, it is convenient to
work with the sigmas for consistency with D = 4, 6, 10.
The framework presented above oﬀers a nice picture of spinors in D = 3, 4, 6, 10;
in each case the minimal spinor is just a 2-component An-valued column [31]:
• An = R: Ψ is a Majorana spinor in D = 3
• An = C: Ψ, X are left- and right-handed Weyl spinors2 in D = 4
• An = H: Ψ, X are left- and right-handed Symplectic-Weyl spinors in D = 6
• An = O: Ψ, X are left- and right-handed Majorana-Weyl spinors in D = 10.
Finally, before moving on to describe super Yang-Mills theories it will be useful
to deﬁne octonionic operators:
ˆσµν = 1
2
h
σµ(¯σν·) −σν(¯σµ·)
i
,
ˆ¯σµν = 1
2
h
¯σµ(σν·) −¯σν(σµ·)
i
,
(4.23)
where the dots represent slots for left- and right-handed spinors, respectively (con-
tinuing with the convention from the previous chapter that octonionic operators are
written with hats). This means that 1
2 ˆσµν and 1
2 ˆ¯σµν are generators of Spin(1, n + 1)
2The left- and right-handed spinors in D = 4 are related by complex conjugation, i.e. if Ψ is a
left-handed spinor then ˜Ψ := εΨ∗(with ε given above) transforms like a right-handed spinor.
This is not true in D = 6 and D = 10 due to non-commutativity. Thus the ‘dotted’ and
‘un-dotted’ spinor index notation is not useful in the general case.
78

and necessarily satisfy the Lorentz algebra
1
4[ˆσµν, ˆσρσ] = 1
2(ησµˆσρν + ηνσˆσµρ −ηρµˆσσν −ηνρˆσµσ),
1
4[ˆ¯σµν, ˆ¯σρσ] = 1
2(ησµˆ¯σρν + ηνσˆ¯σµρ −ηρµˆ¯σσν −ηνρˆ¯σµσ).
(4.24)
These can then be used to represent spacetime 2-forms such as a ﬁeld strength Fµν:
ˆF := 1
2Fµνˆσµν,
ˆ¯F := 1
2Fµνˆ¯σµν,
(4.25)
so that ˆF and ˆ¯F transform under commutation using the Lorentz algbra (4.24):
δ ˆF = 1
4λµν[ ˆF, ˆσµν],
δ ˆ¯F = 1
4λµν[ ˆ¯F, ˆ¯σµν].
(4.26)
For the other division algebras 2-forms can be written similarly, but the positioning
of the brackets is no longer important and the hats can be dropped.
4.2. Super Yang-Mills Theories in D = n + 2
4.2.1. N = 1 Lagrangian and Transformation Rules
Writing a spinor kinetic term in D = n + 2 will require a real, Lorentz-scalar spinor
bilinear. For commuting spinors this is given by
Re(Ψ†X) := 1
2(Ψ†X + (Ψ†X)†) = 1
2(Ψ†X + X †Ψ),
(4.27)
where Ψ is a left-handed spinor, X is a right-handed spinor and the dagger denotes
the conjugate-transpose. It is simple to verify that this is Lorentz-invariant using
the transformations (4.20). Writing Ψ = Ψaea and X = Xaea in terms of their
division-algebraic components this becomes
1
2(ΨT
aXb e∗
aeb + X T
b Ψa e∗
bea) = 1
2ΨT
aXb(e∗
aeb + e∗
bea) = ΨT
aXa,
(4.28)
which is clearly a real number. However, the ﬁrst equality here relies on the compo-
nents Ψa and Xb being ordinary commuting real numbers; for physical spinor ﬁelds,
the components Ψa and Xb are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers and the scalar
product above must be replaced by
Re(iΨ†X) = 1
2(iΨ†X + (iΨ†X)†) = i
2(Ψ†X −X †Ψ),
(4.29)
79

where the complex unit i in the above equation is independent of (and commutes
with) the division algebra An – the † operation is deﬁned to conjugate the factor of
i as well as the elements of An. Note that for anti-commuting spinors
Re(iΨ†X) = −Re(iX †Ψ).
(4.30)
The Lagrangian for a left-handed spinor Ψ is then obtained by applying (4.29) to Ψ
and the right-handed spinor ¯σµ∂µΨ:
−Re(iΨ†¯σµ∂µΨ) = −i
2Ψ†(¯σµ∂µΨ) −i
2(Ψ†¯σµ)∂µΨ + total derivative,
(4.31)
where the association brackets on the left-hand side have been omitted since the
associator is pure-imaginary:
Re(xyz) := Re((xy)z) = Re(x(yz)),
∀x, y, z ∈An.
(4.32)
The overall sign in (4.31) ensures energy-positivity and agreement with the usual
D = 4 expression −iΨ†¯σµ∂µΨ.
The action for (n + 2)-dimensional N = 1 SYM with gauge group G over the
division algebra An is then
S =
Z
dn+2x
 −1
4F A
µνF Aµν −Re(iΨ†A¯σµDµΨA)

Ψ ∈A2

(4.33)
where A = 0, · · · , dim[G] and the covariant derivative and ﬁeld strength are given
by the usual expressions
DµΨA = ∂µΨA + gfBC
AAB
µ ΨC,
F A
µν = ∂µAA
ν −∂νAA
µ + gfBC
AAB
µ AC
ν .
(4.34)
The supersymmetry transformations are
δAA
µ = Re(iΨA†¯σµϵ),
δΨA = 1
2 ˆF Aϵ.
(4.35)
For the associative division algebras An = R, C, H the action and transformation
rules are invariant under right-multiplication of the spinors by a unit-modulus divi-
sion algebra element u ∈An
ΨA →ΨA u,
ϵ →ϵ u,
u∗u = 1.
(4.36)
80

For An = C, H the unit u may be written as u = eθI with θI ∈Im(An), so that for
small θI
δΨ = Ψ θI,
δϵ = ϵ θI,
θI ∈Im(An),
An = C, H.
(4.37)
Thus there is an internal U(1) and Sp(1) ∼= SU(2) symmetry for An = C, H, re-
spectively. This is none other than the R-symmetry of N = 1 SYM in D = 4, 6.
Note the similarity with the triality algebras in Section 3.3 where there was an extra
algebra ex(An) = Ø, u(1), su(2), Ø for R, C, H, O, respectively.
An advantage of using division-algebraic spinors is that one may write the vector’s
transformation without sigma matrices simply by taking the outer product:
δAA = δAA
µσµ = i(ΨAϵ† −ϵΨ†A).
(4.38)
Using (4.10), reversing the trace gives this in terms of AA = Aµ¯σµ:
δ ¯AA = δAA
µ ¯σµ = i(ΨAϵ† −ϵΨ†A) −(trace)
= i(ΨAϵ† −ϵΨ†A) + i(ϵ†ΨA −Ψ†Aϵ)1,
(4.39)
where the trace term was computed as follows. Since i(ΨAϵ† −ϵΨ†A) is a Hermitian
matrix its trace is real:
Tr i(ΨAϵ† −ϵΨ†A) = Re Tr i(ΨAϵ† −ϵΨ†A).
(4.40)
Then by the cyclicity property of the real part of a trace,
Re Tr i(ΨAϵ† −ϵΨ†A) = −Re Tr i(ϵ†ΨA −Ψ†Aϵ) = −i(ϵ†ΨA −Ψ†Aϵ),
(4.41)
where the minus sign in the second equality follows from taking into account the
Grassmann nature of the spinors.
4.2.2. Proof of Supersymmetry
The following proof that the action (4.33) is supersymmetric follows the method
found in the literature [52, 31]. It turns out that the variation vanishes by virtue of
the alternativity of the division algebras. Varying the action gives
δS =
Z
dn+2x
 δAA
ν DµF Aµν −Re(igfBC
AΨ†Aδ ¯ABΨC + 2iΨ†A¯σµDµδΨA)

. (4.42)
Crucially, the ‘3Ψ’ term Re(igfBCAΨ†Aδ ¯ABΨC) vanishes. First deﬁne the trace-
reversed Hermitian outer product of any two anti-commuting spinors Ψ1 and Ψ2
81

by
Ψ1 · Ψ2 = i(Ψ1Ψ†
2 −Ψ2Ψ†
1) −(trace)

2 −Ψ2Ψ†
1) + i(Ψ†
2Ψ1 −Ψ†
1Ψ2)1
= Re(iΨ†
1¯σµΨ2)¯σµ.
(4.43)
Note that the trace −i(Ψ†
2Ψ1 −Ψ†
1Ψ2) is a real number. Then acting on a third
spinor Ψ3 and adding cyclic permutations gives zero
(Ψ1 · Ψ2)Ψ3 + (Ψ2 · Ψ3)Ψ1 + (Ψ3 · Ψ1)Ψ2 ≡0.
(4.44)
To see this, note that
(Ψ1 · Ψ2)Ψ3 = i(Ψ1Ψ†
2 −Ψ2Ψ†
1)Ψ3 + i(Ψ†
2Ψ1 −Ψ†
1Ψ2)Ψ3
= i(Ψ1Ψ†
2 −Ψ2Ψ†
1)Ψ3 + iΨ3(Ψ†
2Ψ1 −Ψ†
1Ψ2),
(4.45)
so that adding cyclic permutations (c.p.) just results in a sum of associators:
(Ψ1 · Ψ2)Ψ3 + c.p. = i

+[Ψ1, Ψ†
2, Ψ3] + [Ψ2, Ψ†
3, Ψ1] + [Ψ3, Ψ†

−[Ψ1, Ψ†
3, Ψ2] −[Ψ2, Ψ†
1, Ψ3] −[Ψ3, Ψ†
2, Ψ1]

.
(4.46)
The six associators then cancel in pairs by alternativity. For example,
[Ψ1, Ψ†
2, Ψ3] −[Ψ1, Ψ†
3, Ψ2] = Ψ1iΨT
2jΨ3k[ei, e∗
j, ek] −Ψ1iΨT
3jΨ2k[ei, e∗
j, ek]
= −Ψ1iΨT
2jΨ3k[ei, ej, ek] + Ψ1iΨT
3jΨ2k[ei, ej, ek]
= Ψ1iΨT
3jΨ2k ([ei, ek, ej] + [ei, ej, ek])
= 0.
(4.47)
With a little more work, using the variation (4.39), the 3Ψ term can be rewritten
gfBC
ARe
 iΨ†Aδ ¯ABΨC
= gfBC
ARe
 iϵ†(ΨC · ΨA)ΨB

(4.48)
but since ΨA · ΨB = −ΨB · ΨA, this is just

ARe
 iϵ† 
(ΨC · ΨA)ΨB + (ΨA · ΨB)ΨC + (ΨB · ΨC)ΨA

(4.49)
Thus the 3Ψ term is zero by virtue of the alternativity of the division algebras.
82

As for the remaining terms in δS, substituting in the variations of A and Ψ gives
δS =
Z
dn+2x

Re(iΨA†¯σνϵ)DµF Aµν −Re(iΨ†A¯σµDµ( ˆF Aϵ))

so by the Leibniz rule
δS =

νρ

,
(4.51)
where the ∂µϵ term has been retained (despite the fact ϵ is of course constant) since
this can be used to read oﬀthe supercurrent – see below. Then, invoking the identity
¯σµ(σ[ν(¯σρ]Ψ)) = ¯σ[µ(σν(¯σρ]Ψ)) + 2ηµ[ν(¯σρ]Ψ)
∀Ψ ∈(An)2,
(4.52)
and applying it to the second term results in
δS =

νρ] −1
2Re(iΨ†A¯σµ(σ[ν(¯σρ]∂µϵ))F A
νρ

.
(4.53)
The ﬁrst term then vanishes by the gauge Bianchi identity D[µF A
νρ] ≡0 and the
second (which contains the supercurrent) because ϵ is constant. The supercurrent
term can be rewritten (by taking the dagger and repeatedly applying (4.32)) as
−1
2Re(iΨ†A¯σµ(σ[ν(¯σρ]∂µϵ))F A
νρ = 1
2Re(i∂µϵ†¯σ[ρ(σν](¯σµΨA)))F A
νρ,
(4.54)
from which one may recover the supercurrent in this formalism,
J µ = ˆ¯F A(¯σµΨA),
(4.55)
and hence the supercharge
Q = −
Z
dn+1x ˆ¯F AΨA
(4.56)
(since ¯σ0 = −1). The supercharge is valued in (An)2 and hence has Q = 2n real
components.

4.2.3. Supersymmetry Algebra and Oﬀ-Shell Formulation
Taking commutators of the supersymmetry transformations given in equation (4.35)
results in
[δ1, δ2]AA
µ = Re(iϵ†
2¯σνϵ1)F A

[δ1, δ2]ΨA = Re(iϵ†

2, (¯σµDµΨA)] + 1
2ϵ1Im(iϵ†
2(¯σµDµΨA)) −(1 ↔2)

.
(4.57)
As usual, the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations is a gauge-covariant
translation, but the algebra fails to close by terms proportional to the fermionic
equation of motion ¯σµDµΨA = 0. The diﬀerence between the number of fermionic
and bosonic degrees of freedom is
2n −(n + 1) = n −1,
(4.58)
so if the algebra is to close oﬀ-shell, the counting suggests using an auxiliary Im(A)-
valued scalar ﬁeld DA = DA
i ei. This idea was explored in [53, 29, 54]. Add to the
action (4.33) the term
SD =
Z
dn+2x
  1
2DA∗DA
,
(4.59)
and modify the supersymmetry transformations to
δAA
µ = Re(iΨA†¯σµϵ),
δΨA = 1
2( ˆF Aϵ + ϵDA),
δDA = Im((iDµΨA†¯σµ)ϵ)
(4.60)
(note that Im(iz) = iRe(z) for some division algebra element z). It is straightforward
to check that the action S + SD is invariant under these new transformations. In
the D = 4, 6 cases DA ∈Im(An) appears in δΨA just like a local R-symmetry
transformation (4.37) with θI →DA, so the auxiliary ﬁelds must transform in the
adjoint of the R-symmetry group, i.e. the singlet for U(1) and the 3 for Sp(1).
However, in the D = 10 case multiplying the octonionic objects ϵ and DA in the
transformations actually breaks Lorentz symmetry. Consider attempting to Lorentz-
transform δΨA. Left- and right-multiplication do not commute in O, i.e. O is non-
associative, so the term ϵDA only transforms like a spinor if DA itself transforms
under Lorentz transformations.
The Lorentz group SO(1, 9) can be broken into
SO(1, 2) × SO(7), where the SO(1, 2) ∼= SL(2, R) is generated by real matrices and
the SO(7) is octonionic, generated by ˆσ(i+1)(j+1). The only way to make sense of the

ϵDA term is to break SO(1, 9) ⊃SO(1, 2) × G2 and allow DA to transform as the 7
of G2. In conclusion, in the D = 10 octonionic theory the imaginary auxiliary ﬁeld
is not a scalar at all but a G2 vector. It is interesting to consider the formalism
regardless.
The commutators of the supersymmetry transformations (4.60) are as follows:
[δ1, δ2]AA
µ = Re(iϵ†
2¯σνϵ1)F A
νµ −1

Thus the algebra is closed for the associative algebras R, C, H, corresponding to
D = 3, 4, 6, but fails to close by associators for D = 10 over O. Interestingly, in the
octonionic case all of these associators vanish if 7 of the 16 real components of the
supersymmetry parameters are set to zero by constraining one of the two octonionic
components of ϵ to be real:
ϵ =
 
ϵs
ϵc

→
 
Re(ϵs)

(4.62)
(the subscripts s and c are chosen to reﬂect the little group representations – see the
following section). This is in agreement with [53, 29], where an imaginary octonionic
auxiliary ﬁeld was used to close the algebra for 9 out of 16 supersymmetries.
4.3. Dimensional Reductions
4.3.1. Little Group Representations and Triality
Having established the Lagrangian and transformation rules for N = 1 super Yang-
Mills in D = 3, 4, 6, 10, it is interesting to move on to dimensional reduction. This
will result in every pure Yang-Mills theory with extended supersymmetry N ≥1 in
all dimensions 3 ≤D ≤10. As an example, consider dimensional reduction from
D = 10 to D = 6. The Lorentz group in D = 6 is SL(2, H), which is clearly a
subgroup of SL(2, O) acting on the H subalgebra of O. Using the Cayley-Dickson
doubling procedure described in Chapter 3 an octonion can be constructed as a pair
of quaternions, and thus reducing from D = 10 to D = 6 is a case of ‘Cayley-Dickson
halving’ to split O into a pair of H constituents. Similar arguments apply for each
other case, although to obtain SYM for D ̸= 3, 4, 6, 10 will require some additional
background on Cliﬀord algebras.
85

To perform these dimensional reductions it will be simpler to consider only the on-
shell degrees of freedom transforming under the little group SO(n)ST, but the process
may equally well be carried out using the full oﬀ-shell ﬁelds. The on-shell states
also have the advantage that they make the connection between super Yang-Mills
and triality manifest, and this is the focus of this subsection.
The little group is the subgroup of SO(1, 1 + n) generated by sums of Lie algebra
elements with parameters λ0µ = λn+1,µ = 0. For notational convenience deﬁne
θab := λa+1,b+1.
(4.63)
Then, writing the spinor Ψ’s two components as ψ, χ ∈An and setting λ0µ =
λn+1,µ = 0, Ψ transforms as
δΨ = 1
4λµνˆσµνΨ ⇒δ
 
ψ
χ
!

4θab
 
e∗
a(ebψ)
ea(e∗

!
.
(4.64)
These are just the transformations of the spinor ψ and conjugate-spinor χ repre-
sentations of SO(n) from Chapter 3. For a solution of the free momentum-space
equation of motion ¯σµpµΨ = 0 (with gauge indices suppressed) with momentum
pµ = (E, 0, · · · , 0, E), the form of the sigma matrices gives
pµ¯σµΨ = 2E

= 0,
(4.65)
i.e. χ = 0, so the on-shell fermionic content is just the single division algebra element
ψ.
Similarly, deﬁning a := Aa+1ea, with λ0µ = λn+1,µ = 0 the vector A transforms as:
δ
 
A0 + An+1
a∗

A0 −An+1

(4.66)
which gives the transformation of the vector a of SO(n)ST:
δa = 1
4θab
ea(e∗
ba) −a(e∗
aeb)

.
(4.67)
After applying the radiation gauge and imposing the vector’s equation of motion,
the bosonic content also amounts only to a single division algebra element a.
86

Then, writing the supersymmetry parameter as
ϵ =
 
ϵs
ϵc
!
,
(4.68)
where ϵs, ϵc ∈An transform respectively as the spinor and conjugate-spinor under
SO(n)ST, only supersymmetry transformations with parameter ϵs = 0 preserve the
solutions with pµ = (E, 0, · · · , 0, E). The supersymmetry transformations (4.35)
then reduce to
δa = −iϵcψ∗,
δψ = iE a∗ϵc.
(4.69)
These are of exactly the same form as the triality relations from equations (3.109),
which were preserved by the triality algebra tri(An). This means that the overall
symmetry algebra of the on-shell supersymmetry transformations (4.69) should be
tri(An), and this is precisely the combination of the spacetime little group’s Lie alge-
bra so(n)ST with the R-symmetry ex(An). In conclusion, the total on-shell symmetry
of super Yang-Mills in D = n + 2 is the triality algebra tri(An) ∼= so(n)ST ⊕ex(An),
whose triples T = ( bA, bB, bC) act on a, ψ, ϵ (dropping the subscript c on ϵ) via equation
(3.124):

(4.70)
where θab ∈so(n)ST and θI ∈ex(An). Expanding θab →θ0i, θij, the spacetime little
group part of the these transformations may be written
δa = bASTa = −1
2θ0i(eia + aei) −1

δϵ = bCSTϵ = −1

(4.71)
which it is useful to express as
δ(a, ψ∗, ϵ) = −1
2θ0i Ti(a, ψ∗, ϵ) −1
4θij TiTj(a, ψ∗, ϵ),
(4.72)
where
Ti = ( bAi, bBi, bCi) := (bLei + bRei, bRei, bLei) ∈tri(An)
(4.73)
and
T(x, y, z) := ( bAx, bBy, bCz)
(4.74)
87

for any T = ( bA, bB, bC) ∈tri(An) and (x, y, z) ∈3An. Better still, deﬁning Tab = −Tba
with T0i := −Ti and Tij := −T[iTj] the so(n)ST transformation becomes
δ(a, ψ∗, ϵ) = TST(a, ψ∗, ϵ) = 1
4θab Tab(a, ψ∗, ϵ).
(4.75)
Note that for n = 1 (i.e. D = 3) any sum of spacetime little group generators gives
TST = 0, corresponding to the trivial little group SO(1)ST ∼= 1. It will be convenient
in the later chapters to write the SO(n) generators Tab as follows:
Tab := (bSab, bReb bRe∗a −bRea bRe∗
b, bLeb bLe∗a −bLea bLe∗
b),
(4.76)
where
bSab x = ⟨ea|x⟩eb −⟨eb|x⟩ea, = −1

 ea(e∗
bx) + x(e∗
aeb)

,
(4.77)
(which appears in (4.67) as the vector transformation) and ˆL and ˆR denote left- and
right-multiplication.
The appearance of tri(An) raises the question of the role the discrete triality
symmetry S3 plays in these theories. Here the spinor ψ and conjugate spinor ϵ have
anti-commuting components and hence cannot be exchanged with the vector a as in
(3.129) (and of course it would make no sense to exchange the constant parameter ϵ
with the spacetime-dependent solutions ψ and a regardless), but group theoretically
the transformations of the three representations are on completely equal footing. For
example, in the quaternionic case the symmetry is tri(H) ∼= su(2)⊕su(2)⊕su(2), with
two of the su(2) parts being the spacetime symmetry algebra so(4) ∼= su(2) ⊕su(2)
and the third being the R-symmetry ex(H); the three representations transform as
δa = −θ+a + aθ−∼(2, 2, 1),
δψ = −θ−ψ + ψθI ∼(2, 1, 2),
δϵ = −θ+ϵ + ϵθI ∼(1, 2, 2),
(4.78)
so the three su(2)s act democratically.
The triality algebra formalism is also suited to describing the various Lie algebras
that emerge in dimensional reduction. First consider the bosonic sector. Group
theoretically, on-shell dimensional reduction from D = n + 2 to D = N + 2 (with
1 ≤N ≤n) amounts to restricting the little group so(n)ST so that it preserves
an RN subspace of An, corresponding to breaking the higher-dimensional vector
a′ ∈An into a lower-dimensional vector a ∈RN and scalars φ ∈Rn−N, where Rn−N
88

is the orthogonal complement of RN in An. Symbolically,
An = RN ⊕Rn−N,
a′ = a + φ = a
¯ae
¯a + φ¯ıe¯ı,
(4.79)
where the index a = 0, 1, · · · , (n −1) labelling the division-algebraic basis elements
has been split into
¯a = 0, 1, · · · , (N −1),
¯ı = N, (N + 1), · · · , (n −1),
(4.80)
so that span{e
¯a} = RN, while span{e¯ı} = Rn−N. This decomposition simply breaks
so(n)ST into the subalgebra
so(N)ST ⊕so(n −N) ⊆so(n)ST,
(4.81)
with equality only for the trivial case of no dimensional reduction: n = N. This
subalgebra is obtained by decomposing the so(n)ST parameters θab →θ¯a¯b, θ¯a¯ı, θ¯ı¯
and then setting θ¯a¯ı = 0, in order to preserve the decomposition in (4.79). The
parameters θ¯a¯b are those of the lower-dimensional spacetime little algebra so(N)ST,
which acts on the N-dimensional vector a and leaves the (n−N) scalars φ invariant;
the parameters θ¯ı¯are those of an internal so(n−N) symmetry, which acts on φ and
leaves a invariant. Explicitly, the transformation of the higher-dimensional vector
with θ¯a¯ı = 0 reduces to:
δa′ = 1

(4.82)
so that a transforms as a vector under so(N)ST, while φ transforms as a vector under
so(n −N).
Hence, taking into account the ex(An) symmetry, the total internal symmetry of
such a theory in D = N + 2 is given by
intN(An) :=

( bA, bB, bC) ∈tri(An)
 bA(RN) = 0, RN ⊆An
	
= so(n −N) ⊕ex(An).
(4.83)
89

while the total on-shell symmetry is
so(N)ST ⊕intN(An) ⊆tri(An)
(4.84)
(equal to tri(An) only for n = N). The extra internal symmetry algebra ex(An) living
in intN(An) acts only on the fermionic sector, whose ﬁeld content may be understood
using the theory of Cliﬀord algebras presented in the following subsection.
4.3.2. Cliﬀord Algebras
For a real vector space V with a bilinear inner product ⟨·|·⟩, the Cliﬀord algebra
Cl(V ) is the (associative) algebra of tensors T(V ) modulo the relation
vw + wv = −2⟨v|w⟩,
∀v, w ∈V.
(4.85)
In other words the product in the algebra Cl(V ) is just the ordinary tensor product,
subject to the rule that the symmetric product of two vectors gives their inner
product (multiplied by −2). When V = RN, equipped with its canonical Euclidean
inner product, Cl(V ) is usually denoted Cl(N). For an orthonormal basis {em} of
RN with m = 1, · · · , N, the deﬁning relation (4.85) becomes
emen + enem = −2δmn,
(4.86)
and so Cl(N) is the unital associative algebra consisting of linear combinations of
products of N distinct anti-commuting square roots of −1: the ‘generating’ basis
elements em. It is easy to see that the ﬁrst three Cliﬀord algebras of this type are
the associative division algebras3
Cl(0) ∼= R,
Cl(1) ∼= C,
Cl(2) ∼= H,
(4.87)
while O cannot be a Cliﬀord algebra, since it is non-associative. The fourth Cliﬀord
algebra is actually Cl(3) ∼= H ⊕H, which is isomorphic to O as a vector space, but
as an algebra consists of diagonal quaternionic matrices under associative matrix
multiplication. The ﬁrst eight Cliﬀord algebras are listed in Table 4.1 (as in the
previous chapter, A[N] denotes the set of N × N matrices with entries in A).
Remarkably, the continuation of Table 4.1 for higher values of N obeys the fol-
3Note that for H there are two independent anti-commuting square roots of −1, namely i and
j, while the third imaginary basis element k ≡ij is simply a product of the ﬁrst two; hence
Cl(2) = H.

Cl(N + 8) ∼= Cl(N) ⊗R[16],
(4.88)
i.e. the algebra Cl(N +8) is made up of 16×16 matrices with entries in Cl(N). Thus
every Cliﬀord algebra Cl(N) is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over the algebra DN,

where (for the cases N = 3, 7 mod 8) a matrix algebra ‘over’ a direct sum of two
division algebras is deﬁned to be the direct sum of the two corresponding matrix
algebras; for example,
Cl(7) = D7[8] = (R ⊕R)[8] := R[8] ⊕R[8].
(4.90)
91

Any Cliﬀord algebra Cl(N) hence has a unique irreducible representation (or two
irreducible representations in the cases with N = 3, 7 mod 8) – that is, the vector
space these matrices naturally act upon. This is called the space of pinors PN, listed
in Table 4.1. Like the Cliﬀord algebras that act upon them, the pinor representations
exhibit Bott periodicity: PN+8 ∼= PN ⊗R16.
The dimension of Cl(N) is 2N, since the whole Cliﬀord algebra has basis
{1,
em,
emen,
· · · ,
em1em2 · · · emN},
(4.91)
with
 N
r

basis elements at level r, i.e. elements of the form em1em2 · · · emr. Under
the involution em →−em, which corresponds to a space inversion of RN, the Cliﬀord
algebra splits into two eigenspaces of dimensions 2N−1, called the even part Cl0(N)
and the odd part Cl′
0(N):
Cl0(N) := {x ∈Cl(N)| x →+x for em →−em},
Cl′
0(N) := {x ∈Cl(N)| x →−x for em →−em}.
(4.92)
The even part clearly forms a closed subalgebra, consisting of sums of products of
even numbers of generators em. Splitting the N generators {em} into {e
¯m, eN} with
¯m = 1, · · · (N −1), it is easy to see that any element of Cl0(N) is a sum of products
of elements γ
¯m := e
¯meN, which satisfy
γ
¯mγ
¯n + γ

¯m = −2δ
¯m¯n,
(4.93)
and thus Cl0(N) is in fact a Cliﬀord algebra itself, isomorphic to Cl(N −1),
Cl0(N) ∼= Cl(N −1),
(4.94)
and hence may be represented by DN−1-valued matrices.
The group Spin(N) ⊂Cl0(N) consists of all elements of Cl(N) that are a product
of an even number of unit vectors in RN. The irreducible representations of Spin(N),
known of course as spinors, are then the irreducible representations of Cl0(N) ∼=
Cl(N −1). In other words, a spinor in N dimensions is a pinor in N −1 dimensions4,
PN−1 ∼= SN,
(4.95)
4The group Pin(N) consists of all elements of Cl(N) that are a product of unit vectors in RN,
and is the double cover of O(N), while its subgroup Spin(N) is the double cover of SO(N).
The irreducible representations of Pin(N), are the irreducible representations of Cl(N) – hence
the name pinors [1].
92

where SN is the space of spinors. It will be useful to deﬁne:
pN := dimR[PN],
sN := dimR[SN].
(4.96)
In the context of on-shell supersymmetric Yang-Mills multiplets, usually there
are N spinors ψI ∈SN, I = 1, 2 · · · , N, which may be packaged as a reducible
representation (SN)N of the Cliﬀord algebra Cl0(N). The action of the generators
em on these spinors is simply left matrix multiplication: emψI (where the em here are
DN−1-valued matrices acting on the DN−1-valued spinors ψI). The largest algebra of
linear transformations M J I of (SN)N that commutes with the action of the Cliﬀord
algebra Cl0(N) is the matrix algebra DN−1[N], which, because of the potential non-
commutativity of DN−1, acts via right matrix multiplication: ψJM J I. It will be
of vital importance in this chapter and in Chapter 6 to consider how this looks in
terms of real matrices acting on RNsN ∼= (SN)N.
If a real vector space V has dimension dim[V ] = NsN for some natural numbers
N and N, then of course there exists a set of (N −1) matrices Em ∈R[NsN]
satisfying
EmEn + EnEm = −2δmn1,
(4.97)
which generates a reducible representation of N copies of the 2N−1-dimensional
Cliﬀord algebra Cl(N). The Cliﬀord algebra generated by the Em acts on a real
vector v ∈V as if it were N spinors ψI valued in SN:
V ∼= RNpN ∼= (SN)N.
(4.98)
For such a real vector space V with dim[V ] = NsN, one ﬁnds that
DN−1[N] ∼=
n
M ∈R[NsN]
[M, Em] = 0
o
,
(4.99)
for Em ∈R[NsN] satisfying (4.97). In other words, just as stated above, the largest
algebra of linear transformations of V ∼= (SN)N that commutes with the action of
the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(N) is isomorphic to the matrix algebra DN−1[N], which takes
DN−1-linear combinations of the N diﬀerent spinors.
Equation (4.99) generalises equations (3.149) and (3.152) for complex and quater-
nionic structures in Section 3.5, since the complex numbers C = Cl(1) and quater-
nions H = Cl(2) are just Cliﬀord algebras; both the complex and quaternionic
structures are simply matrices that obey the deﬁning Cliﬀord algebra relation (4.86)
for Cl(1) and Cl(2), respectively. Just as for complex and quaternionic structures,
93

equation (4.99) restricts to
a(N, DN−1) ∼=
n
M ∈so(NsN)
[M, Em] = 0
o
,
(4.100)
where a(N, DN−1) is deﬁned in (3.143).
For Chapter 6 it will be useful to generalise this to DN−1[NL, NR], the set of
rectangular NL×NR matrices with entries in DN−1, which maps (SN)NL and (SN)NR
into one another. In this case one requires both a left and right set of Cliﬀord algebra
generators, Em ∈R[NLsN] and ˜Em ∈R[NRsN], each satisfying (4.97). Then one
ﬁnds that
DN−1[NL, NR] ∼=

(4.101)
Equation (4.100) has an obvious application in supersymmetry. The R-symmetry
group – that is, the group of automorphisms of the N-extended supersymmetry
algebra – is the group of norm-preserving5 linear transformations of the spinor su-
percharges, which must commute with the Cliﬀord algebra Cl0(D−2) ∼= Cl(D−3) ⊃
Spin(D −2) corresponding to the spacetime little group Spin(D −2). Thus the R-
symmetry for N supercharges in D dimensions has Lie algebra [43]
r(N, D) = a(N, D),
(4.102)
where D := DD−3 is the algebra associated with each spacetime dimension D, over
which Cl(D−3) may be formulated – see (4.89). The Cliﬀord algebras for dimensions
3 ≤D ≤10, along with their corresponding D algebras, spinor representations and
R-symmetry groups are presented in Table 4.2. Note that when D is a direct sum, i.e.
in D = 6, 10, there exist chiral spinors. In this case the number of supersymmetries
N becomes an ordered pair (N +, N −), where N + is the number of left-handed
chiral spinor supercharges and N −is that of the right-handed6. The R-symmetry
group preserves chirality in these dimensions, and so is given by so(N +) ⊕so(N −)
in D = 10 and sp(N +) ⊕sp(N −) in D = 6.
With the above machinery in hand, the question of dimensionally reducing on-
shell super Yang-Mills from D = n + 2 to D = N + 2 is fairly straightforward.
The higher-dimensional quantities (a′, ψ′∗, ϵ′) ∈3An transform under the lower-

6Thus, strictly speaking, what was called N = 1 super Yang-Mills in D = 6, 10 sometimes in this
chapter should have been called (N +, N −) = (1, 0).

Thus each of bB
¯i and bC
¯i determines an isomorphism,
An ∼= (SN)N,
(4.107)
where N = n/sN, just as in equation (4.98). In this way, the higher-dimensional
fermion ψ′ ∈An breaks into N lower-dimensional spinors valued in SN – and similar
for the supersymmetry parameter ϵ′ – so the lower-dimensional theory has N = n/sN
supersymmetries. For example, for D = N + 2 = 4 and N = 4, there is just one
95

Cliﬀord generator bB1 (or bC1), which generates Cl0(N) = Cl0(2) ∼= C, acting on the
reducible representation An = O. In this case bB1 ( bC1) acts as a complex structure
on O, allowing one to reinterpret ψ′ ∈O (ϵ′ ∈O) as N = 4 complex spinors: O ∼= C4
(note that S2 = C, so s2 = 2).
Table 4.3 shows how the fermion ﬁelds in each D = N + 2 ﬁt into the division
algebra An over which the theory may be written, and Appendix A.1 contains
explicit demonstrations of this. As outlined above, this is achieved via dimensional
reduction from D = n+2. The examples given are the maximal theories valued over
An = O and so are obtained from D = 10. The theories with fewer supersymmetries
can then be obtained simply by truncation to division subalgebras of O.

(4.109)
There is more structure in the internal symmetry algebra intN(An) than this might
at ﬁrst suggest. Speciﬁcally, intN(An) is a direct sum of Lie algebras, one of which
is sa(N, D), as expected from the R-symmetry (4.102). This can be seen as follows.
From (4.103) it is clear that [T, so(N)ST] = 0 if and only if [T, T
¯i] = 0 for every ¯i.
Writing T = ( bA, bB, bC), for the spinors this condition translates to
[ bB, bB
¯i] = 0,
[ bC, bC
¯i] = 0,
(4.110)
where bB, bC ∈so(n). This means the internal symmetry is generated by the subset of
so(n) matrices that commutes with the Cliﬀord algebra generators, which according
to (4.100) means that the internal symmetry contains a factor of sa(N, D). Indeed
one ﬁnds that for N > 1
intN(An) = sa(N, D) ⊕exN(An),
(4.111)
where exN(An) is a possible commuting u(1):
exN(An) := intN(An) ⊖sa(N, D) =



u(1),
(N, n) = (2, 2), (2, 4), (6, 8)
Ø,
otherwise.
(4.112)
For N = 2 (i.e. D = 4) these additional factors correspond to the inclusion of
the CPT conjugate. It is particularly convenient that the deﬁnition of intN(An)
is such that in D = 4 the internal symmetry works out to be the R-symmetry
u(1), u(2), su(4) for N = 1, 2, 4 super Yang-Mills; the missing u(1) in the CPT-self-
conjugate N = 4 theory is taken into account automatically:
intN(An) = a(N, D) ⊖δ4,Dδ4,Nu(1),
D = N + 2 > 3.
(4.113)
Also intriguing is the fact that the two equations (4.83) and (4.111) are compati-
ble with one another only because of the existence of the so-called ‘accidental’ Lie
97

algebra isomorphisms
so(2) ∼= u(1),
so(3) ∼= su(2) ∼= sp(1),
so(4) ∼= sp(1) ⊕sp(1),
so(5) ∼= sp(2),
so(6) ∼= su(4).
(4.114)
Moreover, these constitute all the low-dimensional (compact) Lie algebra isomor-
phisms, every one of which is relied upon for the consistency of equations (4.83) and
(4.111).

slot corresponds to the SYM theory in D = N + 2 dimensions with Q = 2n real
supercharge components. Note that every pure SYM theory is included in this table.
Table 4.4 shows the overall (spacetime plus internal) symmetry of each pure super
Yang-Mills in each dimension D = N + 2. In each dimension D > 3 the internal
symmetry intN(An) is just the R-symmetry. Contrastingly, in D = 3 the algebra
intN(An) coincides with the R-symmetry only for the N = 1, 2, 4 theories; the max-
imal N = 8 theory is an exceptional case. The R-symmetry for D = 3 (that is, the
automorphisms of the supersymmetry algebra) for a theory with N supersymmetries
98

in D = 3 is so(N), which simply rotates the N supercharges into one another in
the vector representation. For the maximal D = 3, N = 8 theory the R-symmetry
is then so(8) rather than the so(7) given in Table 4.4. The full R-symmetry so(8) is
only realised when the vector is dualised to a scalar, which can only be carried out
in the free Yang-Mills theory with coupling constant g = 0 (see the Lagrangian in
the next subsection)7.
4.3.3. The Master Lagrangian
Dimensionally reducing the minimally supersymmetric Lagrangian (4.33) from D =
n + 2 to D = N + 2 using the techniques described in the previous subsections
results in a ‘master Lagrangian’, whose input is the dimension D and the division
algebra An, and whose output is the Yang-Mills theory in D = N + 2 with N
supersymmetries (recall that n = NsN = Q/2). The higher-dimensional vector
A′ ∈h2(An) decomposes as

where the subscripts RN and Rn−N refer to the respective projections onto these
subspaces of An.
To obtain the conventional actions, one can always multiply out the division
algebra basis elements as appropriate to the theory of interest. For example, the
D = 4, N = 4 theory has An = A8 = O and SN = S2 = C, so the fermions form
an octonion, written to look like a four complex numbers – see equation (A.14) in
Appendix A.1.2. Multiplying out the basis elements eˆa returns the conventional

Since the master Lagrangian comes from dimensional reduction of the fundamental
N = 1 Lagrangians in D = 3, 4, 6, 10, it is guaranteed to be supersymmetric by
the proof given in the previous section. To close the supersymmetry algebra oﬀ-
shell it is clear that the appropriate auxiliary ﬁeld is valued in Im(An); otherwise,
the form of the terms in the supersymmetry transformations (4.60) is unchanged.
Interestingly, the transformations in the D = 3 octonionic case (N = 1, N = 8) are
Lorentz-covariant with symmetry SO(1, 2) × G2. However, this must be broken to
SO(1, 1) × G2 to close the algebra [29], since one must still impose the constraint of
equation (4.62).
4.4. Summary
This chapter gave a demonstration of how any super Yang-Mills theory in D = N +2
may be written using a pair of algebras: Cl(N −1) ∼= Cl0(N) and An. The internal
symmetry intN(An) is the subalgebra of tri(An) for which one element of the triality
triple ( bA, bB, bC) – say bA – annihilates the subspace RN ⊂An. Imaginary An-valued
auxiliary ﬁelds may be used to close the non-maximal supersymmetry algebra oﬀ-
shell, while the failure to close for maximally supersymmetric theories is attributed
directly to the non-associativity of the octonions.
Pure super Yang-Mills in D dimensions with N supersymmetries can always be
thought of as the descendant of a D = n + 2 theory with N = 1 – its ‘oxidation
endpoint’ – written over An with Q = 2n real supercharge components. However,
100

if one would rather not think in terms of dimensional reduction (or oxidation), then
the number of real supercharge components Q = 2n is suﬃcient to associate a SYM
theory in D dimensions with the n-dimensional division algebra An.
Of course the master Lagrangian (4.116) would be cumbersome to work with; the
key point of the dimensional reductions is to highlight how the triality algebra breaks
up into pieces in each of the dimensions, as this will be important for understanding
supergravity symmetries in the coming chapters. In D = 3 however the N = 1, 2, 4, 8
theories have a particularly simple form written over R, C, H, O, and these theories
will be used in the next chapter to construct a magic square of supergravities.
101

5. A Magic Square from
Yang-Mills Squared
The octonions provide an intuitive basis for deﬁning the ﬁve exceptional groups
G2, F4, E6, E7 and E8.
For example, the smallest of these G2 is the group of
automorphisms of O. Eﬀorts to understand the remaining exceptional groups geo-
metrically in terms of octonions resulted in the Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits magic
square [55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60] presented in Table 5.1. Each slot gives the Lie algebra
of the isometries of the ‘projective plane’1 over a tensor product of division algebras
AL ⊗AR, with exceptional groups appearing whenever one of the two algebras is
O. A detailed construction of the magic square will be given in Section 5.2.

In apparently completely diﬀerent developments, a popular thread in attempts
to understand the quantum theory of gravity is the idea of ‘gravity as the square
of Yang-Mills’.
The idea in its most basic form is that a symmetric tensor gµν
can be built from the symmetric tensor product of two vector ﬁelds Aµ and ˜Aµ as
gµν ∼A(µ ˜Aν) (or rather any symmetric tensor may be written as a sum of such tensor
products). It is easy to see that this can incorporate supersymmetry; tensoring a
minimal Yang-Mills multiplet {Aµ, λ} (in D = 4 say) with a vector ﬁeld ˜Aµ results
in a minimal supergravity multiplet {gµν, Ψµ} ∼{A(µ ˜Aν), λ ˜Aµ}.
This idea of tensoring Yang-Mills multiplets appears in many diﬀerent guises,
which often overlap: KLT relations in string theory [61], D = 10 Type IIA and
1Note that the manifolds associated with the (H ⊗O) and (O ⊗O) cases are not strictly speak-
ing projective spaces, but nevertheless constitute geometries which are often referred to as
projective planes.

IIB supergravity multiplets from D = 10 super Yang-Mills multiplets [15], asym-
metric orbifold constructions [62], gravity anomalies from gauge anomalies [63], (su-
per)gravity scattering amplitudes from those of (super) Yang-Mills [64, 65, 66] in
various dimensions and even classical general relativity solutions from classical gauge
theory solutions [67, 68]. While it would seem there is now a growing web of relations
connecting gravity to ‘gauge × gauge’, it is as yet not clear to what extent gravity
may really be regarded as the square of Yang-Mills. In an attempt to address this
question, Section 5.1 will contain some further discussion of what it means to tensor
Yang-Mills multiplets at the classical linearised level.
Bringing all of this together, the culmination of this chapter in Section 5.3 is
the following result: tensoring pairs of D = 3 SYM multiplets with NL = 1, 2, 4, 8
and NR = 1, 2, 4, 8 yields a magic square of D = 3 supergravity theories with
N = NL + NR = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, as presented in Table 5.6. For N > 8
the resulting multiplets are those of pure supergravity; for N ≤8 pure supergravity
is coupled to vector multiplets. In both cases the ﬁeld content is such that the
U-dualities exactly match the groups of the magic square, Table 5.3.
This will
be interpreted using the division algebra description of D = 3 Yang-Mills with
N = 1, 2, 4, 8 over R, C, H, O, as introduced in the previous chapter.
5.1. Gravity as the Square of Yang-Mills
In recent years gauge and gravitational scattering amplitudes have been subject
to something of a renaissance [69], resulting not only in dramatic computational
advances but also important conceptual insights.
One such development, strad-
dling both the technical and conceptual, is the colour-kinematic duality of gauge
amplitudes introduced by Bern, Carrasco and Johansson [64]. Exploiting this dual-
ity it has been shown that gravitational amplitudes may be reconstructed using a
double-copy of gauge amplitudes, suggesting a possible interpretation of perturba-
tive gravity as ‘the square of Yang-Mills’ [65, 70]. This perspective has proven itself
remarkably eﬀective, rendering possible previously intractable gravitational scatter-
ing amplitude calculations [71]; it is both conceptually suggestive and technically
advantageous. Yet, the idea of gravity as the square of Yang-Mills is not speciﬁc to
amplitudes, having appeared previously in a number of diﬀerent, but often related,
contexts [61, 15, 62, 63, 72, 67, 68].
These many-faceted relations have furthered our understanding of (super)gravity
itself.
For example, the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) color-kinematic duality
[64, 65] has facilitated the computation of higher-loop D = 4, N = 8 supergravity
103

amplitudes previously regarded as beyond reach. See, for example, [71] and the
references therein. This promises to answer the long-standing questions [73] of when
and how perturbative N = 8 supergravity diverges – if indeed it diverges at all [74].
In spite of these remarkable developments, it is still not entirely clear what pre-
cisely it means to say that gravity is the square of Yang-Mills.
This thesis will
address this question mainly at the group-theoretic level, where the idea is sim-
ply to take the symmetric tensor product of a pair of momentum-space Yang-Mills
vector ﬁelds Aµ(k) and ˜Aν(k) in order to construct a symmetric traceless matrix
hµν(k) = A(µ ˜Aν) −1
DAρ ˜Aρ ηµν, which could be interpreted as the momentum-space
graviton ﬁeld, i.e. the Fourier transform hµν(k) of a small deviation hµν(x) of the
metric gµν(x) from Minkowski space, gµν(x) ≃ηµν + hµν(x).
This can be generalised to supersymmetric theories. A pure N-extended super
Yang-Mills theory in D spacetime dimensions has ﬁeld content {Aµ, λI, φ¯ı}, where
the (deﬁning representation) R-symmetry index I labels the N fermions and ¯ı labels
the (Q/2 + 2 −D) scalars, with Q the total number of real supercharge components
(so for example N = 4 SYM in D = 4 has Q = 16 and hence contains 16/2+2−4 = 6
scalar ﬁelds). Temporarily ignoring gauge indices, tensoring a (momentum-space)
SYM multiplet {Aµ, λI, φ¯ı} with another { ˜Aµ, ˜λI′, ˜φ¯ı′} produces the ﬁeld content of
a supergravity theory:
⊗
˜Aν
˜λI′
˜φ¯ı′
Aµ
hµν + Bµν + ϕ

(5.1)
where the symbol ⊗denotes the tensor product of Lorentz representations, which
are carried out as follows. The vector-vector tensor product Aµ ˜Aν gives
hµν = A(µ ˜Aν) −1
DAρ ˜Aρ ηµν,
Bµν = A[µ ˜Aν],
ϕ = Aµ ˜Aµ,
(5.2)
while the fermion-vector tensor products Aµ˜λI′ and λI ˜Aµ give
ΨI
µ = 1

ΨI′
µ = 1
2γνγµAν˜λI′,
χI = 1
2γµλI ˜Aµ,
χI′ = 1
2γµAµ˜λI′.
(5.3)
104

The tensor product of any ﬁeld with the scalars is trivial, giving
A¯ı
µ = φ¯ı ˜Aµ,
A¯ı′
µ = Aµ ˜φ¯ı′,
χI¯ı′ = λI ˜φ¯ı′,
χI′¯ı = φ¯ı˜λI′,
(5.4)
and
ϕ¯ı¯ı′ = φ¯ı ˜φ¯ı′.
(5.5)
Finally, the fermion-fermion tensor product must be decomposed using Fierz expan-
sion, which gives a diﬀerent result in each dimension, depending on the symmetry
of the gamma matrices. In string theory parlance this is known as the Ramond-
Ramond sector. Although the particular set of Ramond-Ramond p-forms φII′
RR + · · ·
is dimension-dependent, there is always a set of NLNR scalar ﬁelds φII′
RR, which are
related to the Yang-Mills fermions as
i¯λIγµ˜λI′ = ∂µφII′
RR.
(5.6)
In general it is the (p + 1)-form ﬁeld strengths F of Ramond-Ramond p-forms that
are produced from the fermion-fermion products:
i¯λIγµ1···µp+1˜λI′ = Fµ1···µp+1.
(5.7)
This can be seen from dimensional analysis, which will be discussed below.
Since the Yang-Mills R-symmetry (fundamental representation) indices take val-
ues I = 1, · · · , NL and I′ = 1, · · · , NR, there are N = NL+NR gravitini ΨI
µ and ΨI′
µ
in the resulting Yang-Mills-squared multiplet. Indeed the ﬁeld content produced for
each D and NL, NR constitutes that of a supergravity theory with NL + NR super-
symmetries:
[NL SYM] ⊗[NR SYM] →[N = NL + NR Supergravity].
(5.8)
Attempting to interpret gravity as the ‘square of’ gauge theory, the tensor prod-
ucts above can be considered from one of two viewpoints. The ﬁrst and more con-
servative of these is that this is a purely (super-)group-theoretic dictionary, which
applies only to supermultiplets as representations of the super-Poincar´e group. The
second viewpoint is that equations (5.2)–(5.7) represent a genuine ansatz describing
gravity ﬁelds in terms of Yang-Mills ﬁelds at the linearised level. This is a fairly
new idea, explored in [75].
If equations (5.2)–(5.7) are to be taken seriously as a gravity-Yang-Mills dictio-
105

nary, the ﬁrst question is how the two (in general distinct) Yang-Mills gauge groups
GL and GR are to be accommodated. The Yang-Mills multiplets {AA
µ, λIA, φ¯ıA} and
{ ˜AA′
µ , ˜λI′A′, ˜φ¯ı′A′} carry adjoint indices A = 1, · · · , dim[GL] and A′ = 1, · · · , dim[GR],
which may be taken into account by introducing a ‘spectator’ scalar function ΦAA′(k)
valued in the bi-adjoint of GL × GR. The candidate graviton ﬁeld hµν may then be
written as

The appearance of this scalar ΦAA′ seems to be roughly consistent with the obser-
vation [76, 77, 78] that at tree-level the product of two SYM amplitudes (or, to be
precise, their integrands) produces a gravitational amplitude multiplied by an addi-
tional factor that happens to be precisely the appropriate amplitude for a bi-adjoint
scalar ﬁeld with a cubic Lagrangian. From this perspective the schematic relation
‘Yang-Mills × Yang-Mills = gravity’ is replaced by the even more peculiar statement
that ‘Yang-Mills × Yang-Mills = gravity × φ3,’ which turns out to lead to the BCJ
color-kinematic duality [77].
The relation ‘Yang-Mills × Yang-Mills = gravity × φ3’ refers of course to scat-
tering amplitudes calculated and multiplied in momentum space, and the gravity-
Yang-Mills dictionary presented above is also for ﬁelds in momentum space. The
Fourier transform of a product f(k)g(k) of two functions of momentum f(k) and
g(k) is a convolution in position space (f ⋆g)(x), deﬁned by
(f ⋆g)(x) =
Z
dDy f(y)g(x −y),
(5.10)
where f(x) and g(x) are the respective Fourier transforms of f(k) and g(k). The
position-space version of (5.9) is then

(5.11)
The equations (5.2)–(5.7) deﬁne a complete supergravity-Yang-Mills dictionary, pro-
vided that one adopts the convention that juxtaposition of position-space Yang-Mills
ﬁelds with and without tildes ∼denotes a convoluted contraction with the gauge-
bi-adjoint spectator scalar ΦAA′(x),
f(x)˜g(x) := (ΦAA′ ⋆f A ⋆˜gA′)(x),
∀f(x), ˜g(x),
(5.12)
while for momentum-space Yang-Mills ﬁelds juxtaposition denotes an ordinary prod-
uct contraction with ΦAA′(k). The physical meaning of such a description at the ﬁeld
theory level is somewhat mysterious, due to the non-local nature of convolutions.
106

A remarkable feature of this proposed gravity-Yang-Mills dictionary is that if the
two gauge supermultiplets are taken to describe linearised Yang-Mills theories then
their respective gauge transformations result in gravitational gauge transformations.
A gauge ﬁeld AA
µ of linearised Yang-Mills transforms as
δAA
µ(x) = ∂µσA(x) + f A
BCAB
µ (x)θC,
(5.13)
where the σA(x) are local gauge parameters and the θA are global parameters.
Transforming the two Yang-Mills ﬁelds in (5.11) by (5.13), while transforming the
spectator ﬁeld in the bi-adjoint as
δΦAA′ = −f C
ABΦCA′θB + −˜f C′
A′B′ΦAC′ ˜θB′
(5.14)
results in a linearised general coordinate transformation, or spin-2 gauge transfor-
mation,
δhµν = ∂µξν + ∂νξµ,
(5.15)
where, using the shorthand notation of (5.12),
ξµ := 1
2(σ ˜Aµ + Aµ˜σ).
(5.16)
This relies upon the following vital property of convolutions under a derivative:
∂µ(f ⋆g) = (∂µf) ⋆g = f ⋆(∂µg).
(5.17)
In fact, the local symmetries of linearised super Yang-Mills give rise via ‘squaring’
to all of the local symmetry transformations of the resulting linearised supergrav-
ities: spin-2 gauge transformations, local Lorentz transformations, gravitino gauge
transformations and p-form gauge transformations [75]. For example, the gravitini
ΨI
µ, ΨI′
µ constructed as in (5.3) transform under Yang-Mills gauge transformations
as
δΨI
µ = ∂µϵI,
δΨI′
µ = ∂µϵI′,
(5.18)
where
ϵI := λI˜σ,
ϵI′ := σ˜λI′,
(5.19)
which is exactly as required for gravitino gauge transformations (see (2.43)).
The dimensions of the gravitational ﬁelds on the respective left-hand sides of the
ans¨atze (5.2)–(5.7) must match those of the corresponding Yang-Mills expressions
on the right-hand sides. For example, the ﬁelds hµν, AA
µ and ˜AA′
µ each have mass
107

dimension
1
2(D −2), so the equation (5.11) is only consistent if ΦAA′ has mass
dimension −1
2(D −2). This is the exact negative of the dimension expected for
a scalar ﬁeld. That ΦAA′ has mass dimension −1
2(D −2) is also consistent with
the remaining equations in (5.2)–(5.7) (taking into account the notation deﬁned in
(5.12)), since all the fermions have mass dimension 1
2(D−1) and all the bosons have
1
2(D −2). One obvious possible explanation for the negative dimension of ΦAA′ is
that it could be related to a bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld φAA′ with canonical kinetic term
and cubic interaction term by
ΦAA′ = φAA′
φ2 ,
(5.20)
where φ2 = φAA′φAA′. Although it is admittedly speculative, (5.20) gives ΦAA′ the
correct dimension and is also superﬁcially consistent with the relations between spin
s scattering amplitudes M(s) of the kind discussed in the double-copy literature
[76, 77, 78], which take the form
M(2) = M(1)M −1(0)M(1),
M(3
2) = M(1
2)M −1(0)M(1).
(5.21)
The main focus of this and the following chapter is on the Yang-Mills origin of
the global symmetries of supergravities. Supergravities are characterized by non-
compact global symmetries G (these are the so-called U-dualities – see Section
2.8) with local compact subgroups H, for example G = E7(7) and H = SU(8)
for N = 8 supergravity in D = 4; whereas the initial Yang-Mills theories have
global R-symmetries, for example R = SU(4) for N = 4 in D = 4 (see [79] for an
approach linking SU(4) to SU(8) based on scattering amplitudes). In the follow-
ing section, the D = 3 super Yang-Mills theories from Chapter 4 will be tensored
with one another to reveal a magic square of D = 3 supergravity theories. Hence,
looking through the prism of ‘gravity = gauge × gauge’ uncovers novel structural
features of the symmetries in D = 3 supergravity. Understanding supergravity and
its symmetries is essential in the context of string/M-theory, since it constitutes
their low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory limit. In particular, supergravity has been
central in exposing the non-perturbative aspects of string theory. Here, symmetries,
especially U-duality, have played a crucial role – for example in constructing black
hole solutions – and this highlights their signiﬁcance.
Three-dimensional supergravity is rather special, since the metric and gravitino
carry no dynamical degrees of freedom, while a vector ﬁeld may be dualised – see
Section 2.8 – to a scalar. Thus the dynamical bosonic degrees of freedom are uniﬁed
as scalar ﬁelds of a G/H coset. This throws light on higher-dimensional theories
108

that produce D = 3 supergravities upon dimensional reduction, and this is very
much the case in the next chapter when the magic square will be generalised to
D = 3, 4, · · · , 9, 10 [80, 81]. Moreover, D = 3 is intrinsically interesting for a number
of reasons [82, 83, 84, 66], one important example being the surprising observation
that pure three-dimensional quantum gravity is actually solvable [85, 86].
5.2. Mathematical Interlude: The Magic Square
5.2.1. F4 and the Exceptional Jordan Algebra
After G2, the second smallest exceptional group is F4. It has triality intricately
built into its structure and is a useful a prototype for constructing the remaining
exceptional groups E6, E7 and E8 (and is a subgroup of each). Arguably the simplest
interpretation of F4 comes via its role as the automorphism group of the exceptional
Jordan algebra.
A Jordan algebra J with product ◦is a commutative but non-
associative algebra (over a ﬁeld) satisfying the Jordan identity
(X ◦Y ) ◦(X ◦X) = X ◦
 Y ◦(X ◦X)

,
X, Y ∈J.
(5.22)
Hermitian N × N matrices hN(A) with A = R, C, H and N ≥2 form a Jordan
algebra JN(A) under the product
H1 ◦H2 := 1
2(H1H2 + H2H1),
H1, H2 ∈hN(A).
(5.23)
It turns out that Hermitian 3 × 3 matrices h3(O) also form a Jordan algebra under
this product: the exceptional Jordan algebra J3(O). Simple counting shows that this
has dimension (3×1)+(3×8) = 27, since a matrix of h3(O) has three real elements
on its diagonal and three independent octonionic components on its oﬀ-diagonal.
Consider the automorphisms Aut(JN(An)) of the Jordan algebra JN(An) – see
Subsection 3.2.2 for the deﬁnition of automorphisms. It is clear that for the asso-
ciative division algebras, An = R, C, H, the Jordan product (5.23) is preserved by
the ‘unitary’ transformation
H →UHU †,
U †U = UU † = 1
(5.24)
for all H ∈JN(An). Writing U = eT, at the Lie algebra level (5.24) becomes
δH = [T, H],
T † = −T,
(5.25)
109

which is by deﬁnition a derivation of JN(An), since (5.24) is an automorphism.
In fact, any derivation of JN(An), An = R, C, H, may be written in the form
(5.25). The Lie algebra of such anti-Hermitian matrices T is a(N, An), as deﬁned
in (3.143), which is just so(N), u(N) and sp(N) for An = R, C, H, respectively.
However, it is not true that der(JN(An)) is just a(N, An), since there is a slight
subtlety involving the trace of such anti-Hermitian matrices. Any N × N matrix
M with entries in An = R, C, H may be decomposed into a traceless part M ′ and a
trace part proportional to the identity:
M = M ′ + 1
N Tr(M)1,
(5.26)
where
M ′ := M −1
N Tr(M)1.
(5.27)
Doing this for T ∈a(N, An) gives
T = T ′ + α1,
(5.28)
where α =
1
N Tr(T) is pure-imaginary, since T is anti-Hermitian. Equation (5.25)
then becomes
δH = [T ′, H] + [α, H].
(5.29)
For An = R, C the second term actually does not contribute – for R there is no
imaginary subspace, so α = 0, while C is commutative, so α ∈Im(C) commutes
with any H. Contrastingly, in the quaternionic case, since H is non-commutative,
the second term generates a derivation of H itself, which acts component-wise on
H. It then makes sense to deﬁne
sa(N, An) := a′(N, An) + der(An),
(5.30)
where a′(N, An) is the space of traceless anti-Hermitian matrices,
a′(N, An) :=

T ′ ∈A[N]
 T ′† = −T ′, Tr(T ′) = 0
	
,
(5.31)
in which case the algebra of derivations der(JN(An)) is just sa(N, An) for the three
smallest division algebras. The der(An) term in (5.30) corresponds to the α com-
mutator in (5.29), which is trivial for An = R, C, while der(H) = so(3). It is easy
to see that the algebra sa(N, An) is just so(N), su(N) and sp(N) for An = R, C, H,
respectively. It will be useful below to note that for these division algebras the
110

deﬁnition (5.30) could alternatively be replaced by
sa(N, An) := a′(N, An) + so(n −1),
(5.32)
since for An = R, C, H the derivations der(An) are the same as so(n −1) rotations
of the imaginary subspace (which are of course trivial for R, C).
In fact sa(N, An) can also be deﬁned analogously for An = O, N = 2, 3, but there
is a subtlety: for An = O the two deﬁnitions (5.30) and (5.32) are inequivalent,
since der(O) = g2, while rotations of the imaginary subspace form the larger group
so(7) ⊃g2.
For N = 3 the ﬁrst deﬁnition (5.30) works well for the octonions.
However, it turns out that for N = 2 only the second deﬁnition (5.32) gives a set
closed under the Lie bracket (taking repeated commutators of the set of matrices in
the ﬁrst deﬁnition just generates the remaining seven generators of so(7) −g2). As
a result, sa(N, O) is deﬁned (in this thesis) as
sa(N, O) :=



a′(2, O) + so(7),
N = 2,
a′(3, O) + der(O),
N = 3.
(5.33)
Then, by construction, for any Hermitian Jordan algebra JN(An) (where N is un-
derstood to be ≥2 for An = R, C, H and equal to 3 if An = O) the derivations are
given by
der(JN(An)) ∼= sa(N, An).
(5.34)
Although 2×2 octonionic Hermitian matrices h2(O) do not strictly form a Jordan
algebra, sa(2, An) still naturally acts on h2(An) for any division algebra An. Recall
that h2(An) is just the space of matrices of the form in (4.10) used to represent
(n + 2)-dimensional spacetime vectors in the previous chapter. In fact, sa(2, An) is
none other than so(n+1), the ‘spatial’ subalgebra of the Lorentz algebra sl(2, An) ∼=
so(1, n + 1) leaving the trace (or the ‘time’ component) of H ∈h2(An) invariant –
see equations (4.5) and (4.6). An inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation as in equation
(4.11) with parameters λµν = −λνµ may be split up into boosts λ0r, r = 1, · · · , (n +
1), and compact so(n + 1) rotations λrs. Then by (4.11) H ∈h2(An) transforms
under sl(2, An) as
δH = 1
4λµν σµ(¯σνH) −H(¯σµσν)

= 1
4λrs  σr(σsH) −H(σrσs)

+ 1
2λ0r σrH + Hσr

,
(5.35)
i.e. by combining an sa(2, An) ∼= so(n+1) rotation with parameters λrs and a boost
given by an anti-commutator with λ0rσr ∈h′
2(An). Incidentally, this highlights that
111

sl(2, An) ∼= sa(2, An) + h′
2(An), just as one might expect2. The compact part of the
transformation with λ0r = 0 may be rewritten as
δH = bOH + [T, H],
bO ∈so(n −1), T ∈a′(2, An),
(5.36)
demonstrating that so(n + 1) is indeed sa(2, An), as deﬁned in (5.32)3. Note that
the trace (time component) is invariant under this transformation – the trace part
commutes with any T, and, since it is real, is annihilated by any bO ∈so(n −1).
For N > 2 (restricted to N = 3 in the octonionic case), sa(N, An) as given in
(5.30) acts on H ∈hN(An) as
δH = bdH + [T, H],
bd ∈der(An),
T ∈a′(N, An).
(5.37)
Any H ∈hN(An) may be written as a sum of a traceless part and a real trace part
H = H′ + 1
N Tr(H)1,
(5.38)
and only the traceless part H′ transforms non-trivially under sa(N, An) – the trace
part commutes with any T, and, since it is real, is annihilated by any bd ∈der(An).
For N = 3, sa(3, An) is so(3), su(3) and sp(3) for R, C and H, respectively,
while sa(3, O) may be taken as the deﬁnition of f4, the Lie algebra of F4.
The
space of traceless anti-Hermitian 3 × 3 octonionic matrices a′(3, O) has dimension
(2×7)+(3×8) = 38, while der(O) = g2 has dimension 14, so by (5.30), the dimension
of F4 must be 38 + 14 = 52. The 26-dimensional space of Hermitian traceless 3 × 3
octonionic matrices h′
3(O) transforms irreducibly under F4 and deﬁnes its smallest
non-trivial representation, the 26.
It is illuminating to consider the Lie algebra f4 ∼= sa(3, O) in terms of its 2 × 2
subalgebra so(9) ∼= sa(2, O), which will emerge as follows. Consider the particular
diagonal matrix P ′
0 ∈h′
3(O) deﬁned as
P ′
0 := 1

(P ′
0 is just the traceless part of the matrix P0 := diag(1, 0, 0), which will be used
2In general for the associative division algebras sl(N, An) ∼= sa(N, An) + h′
N(An). For example
sl(N, R) is the algebra of all anti-symmetric and symmetric traceless N × N real matrices.

later in the chapter in Section 5.4). From (5.37), the subalgebra of sa(3, O) such
that δP ′

T =

0
0
t
!
,
(5.40)
where t is an anti-Hermitian (but not in general traceless) 2 × 2 matrix, i.e. an
element of a(2, O). To see how the transformation (5.37) with the block-diagonal
T of (5.40) acts upon a general H ∈h′
3(O), one may write it in terms of the lower
2 × 2 block subspace,
H =

4θrsσr(σsΨ) + ΨθI,
δA = 1
4θrs σr(σsA) −A(σrσs)

(5.43)
(and δ(Tr(A)) = 0). For An = O, these are just the Spin(9) transformations of
a spinor Ψ and vector A as obtained from (4.20) and (4.11), demonstrating the
decomposition
26 →1 + 9 + 16.
(5.44)
The adjoint of F4 itself decomposes as
52 →36 + 16,
(5.45)
so F4 can be seen as the group resulting from combining the adjoint of Spin(9) with
its spinor representation. This is the interpretation of F4 that will generalise to
include E6, E7 and E8.
In fact, for any division algebra one may consider breaking sa(3, An) into the
stabiliser of P ′
0. Since this is just derivations of An and 2×2 matrices t ∈sa(2, An) as
in (5.40), this subalgebra is just der(An)+a(2, An) ⊂sa(3, An). It is straightforward
to check that this gives so(2), su(2) ⊕u(1), sp(2) ⊕sp(1) and so(9) for R, C, H, O,
113

respectively4. In other words, in general these algebras are just the direct sum of
two pieces: so(n + 1) ∼= sa(2, An) and an extra u(1) for An = C and sp(1) for
An = H – precisely the same extra pieces that appear in the triality algebras:
ex(An) = Ø, u(1), sp(1), Ø for R, C, H, O (see Table 3.2). In each case one may view
sa(3, An) as the algebra resulting from combining sa(2, An)⊕ex(An) with its spinor
representation: (An)2.
5.2.2. The Reduced Magic Square
Just as the algebras sa(3, An) may be built up from so(n+1) subalgebras, the magic
square in Table 5.1 may be built up from Lie algebras of orthogonal groups acting
on tensor products of division algebras AL ⊗AR. The tensor product AL ⊗AR is
the algebra with basis elements ea˜ea′ = ˜ea′ea, where ea and ˜ea′ are those of AL and
AR, respectively, with a = 0, 1, · · · , (nL −1) and a′ = 0, 1, · · · , (nR −1). An element
of AL ⊗AR is a linear combination xaa′ea˜ea′, with xaa′ ∈R, and the multiplication
rule is simply inherited from those of AL and AR.
Consider the set of 2 × 2 matrices {σA}, A = 1, · · · , (nL + nR) deﬁned as
{σA} = {σa+1, σa′+1ε} :=
( 
0
e∗
a
ea
0
!
,
 
˜e∗
a′
0
0
−˜ea′
!)
.
(5.46)
Note that for the special case AR = R there is only one AR basis element ˜ea′ = 1 and
these matrices become the spatial Spin(nL + 1) Pauli matrices σr from the previous
subsection. Deﬁning ¯σA := σ†
A, it is easy to check that for any Ψ, X ∈(AL ⊗AR)2,
σA(¯σBΨ) + σB(¯σAΨ) = 2δABΨ,
¯σA(σBΨ) + ¯σB(σAΨ) = 2δABX.
(5.47)
Then, by the usual reasoning, this means that Ψ and X transform as left- and
right-handed Weyl spinors of so(nL + nR) as
δΨ = 1
4θABσA(¯σBΨ),
δX = 1
4θAB¯σA(σBX),
(5.48)
where θAB = −θBA are arbitrary parameters. Writing Ψ = (Ψ1, Ψ2) with Ψ1, Ψ2 ∈
4In the octonionic case note that so(7) ∼= der(O) + Im(O) so that a(2, O) + der(O) becomes
a′(2, O) + so(7), which is just so(9) ∼= sa(2, O).

(5.49)
and similar for X. The ﬁrst two terms are just the spinor transformations of so(nL)
and so(nR) from (3.103), which demonstrates the decomposition
so(nL + nR) ∼= so(nL) ⊕so(nR) + AL ⊗AR.
(5.50)
However, in general Ψ and X are natural irreducible representations of a larger
algebra,
L2(AL, AR) := so(nL + nR) ⊕ex(AL) ⊕ex(AR),
(5.51)
rather than just so(nL + nR), since when AL, AR = C, H the transformations (5.48)
commute with (right-)multiplication of the spinors Ψ and X by imaginary division
algebra elements θI ∈Im(AL) and ˜θI ∈Im(AR):
δΨ = 1
4θABσA(¯σBΨ) + ΨθI + Ψ˜θI,
δX = 1
4θAB¯σA(σBX) + XθI + X ˜θI.
(5.52)
This generates an extra u(1) when one of the two division algebras is C and and extra
sp(1) when one of the algebras is H – see Table 5.2. This is of course reminiscent of
the triality algebras in Chapters 3 and 4, and indeed (5.50) means that L2(AL, AR)
may be decomposed into
L2(AL, AR) ∼= so(nL) ⊕ex(AL) ⊕so(nR) ⊕ex(AR) + AL ⊗AR
∼= tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) + AL ⊗AR.
(5.53)
The array of Lie algebras given by L2(AL, AR) is called the reduced magic square and
is presented in Table 5.2. For the magic square of supergravities these Lie algebras
will be shown to be those of the maximal compact subgroups H of the non-compact
U-duality groups G. Note that L2(AL, R) gives the algebras satisfying δP ′
0 = 0 from
the previous subsection.

5.2.3. The Magic Square Construction
Equation (5.45) demonstrated that F4 is the group resulting from combining the
adjoint 36 of Spin(9) with additional generators transforming as its spinor repre-
sentation 16. This unusual result can be seen as a consequence of Spin(8) triality.
Decomposing F4 into Spin(9) and then further into Spin(8) this becomes clear:
52 →36 + 16
→28 + 8v + 8s + 8c.
(5.54)
Thus the action of F4 on its adjoint rotates the three representations 8v, 8s and 8c
into one another, which is a possibility granted by the discrete triality symmetry of
tri(O) = so(8). In more octonionic language (5.54) becomes
f4 ∼= tri(O) + 3O.
(5.55)
The commutators of this Lie algebra can be calculated fairly straightforwardly by
acting successively on h3(O) using (5.37). First, write the Jordan algebra element
H ∈h3(O) as
H =

xv, xs, xc ∈O,

(5.57)
Temporarily setting xv, xs, xc = 0, one ﬁnds using (5.37) that α, β and the derivation
bd combine just such that the three octonionic matrix elements a, ψ, χ of H transform
116

by none other than the standard so(8) triality transformations in (3.124):
δH = bdH + [T, H] =

(5.58)
with ( bA, bB, bC) ∈tri(O) deﬁned in (3.124) (and bB⋆ψ := ( bBψ∗)∗).
This is how
tri(O) ⊂f4 acts on H ∈h3(O). The [tri(O), tri(O)] commutators are then given
by the natural commutators of so(8). Now reinstating (xv, x∗
s, xc) ∈3O and setting
( bA, bB, bC) = 0 gives δH equal to
[T, H] =

δψ = (h1 −h2)xs + a∗xc −x∗

δχ = (h3 −h1)xc + xvψ + axs,
(5.60)
which manifestly makes use of the triality relations (3.109) – this shows that these
transformations are covariant under so(8). Now, to shorten the notation for the
[3O, 3O] commutators write
(xv, x∗

(the conjugation on the so(8) spinor xs here is just for convenience; it corresponds to
the fact that under so(8) it is the octonionic conjugate of the spinor that transforms
with the operator bB – see equations (3.124)). Then applying the transformations
(5.60) twice one ﬁnds that
[(0, 0, xc), (0, x∗
s, 0)] = (xcx∗
s, 0, 0),
[(xv, 0, 0), (0, 0, xc)] = (0, x∗
vxc, 0),
[(0, x∗
s, 0), (xv, 0, 0)] = (0, 0, xvxs),
(5.62)
117

which again uses the triality relations (3.109). Next, applying (5.60) twice for two
matrices of the same type shows that
[(xv, 0, 0), (yv, 0, 0)] = Txv,yv,
[(0, x∗
s, 0), (0, y∗
s, 0)] = ϑ2Txs,ys,
[(0, 0, xc), (0, 0, yc)] = ϑTxc,yc,
(5.63)
where ϑ is the order-three Lie algebra automorphism
ϑ : ( bA, bB, bC) 7→( bB⋆, bC, bA⋆),
(5.64)
introduced in Section 3.3, and Tx,y ∈tri(O) is deﬁned by
Tx,y := (bSx,y, bRy bRx∗−bRx bRy∗, bLybLx∗−bLxbLy∗),
(5.65)
where
bSx,y z = ⟨x|z⟩y −⟨y|z⟩x,
bLx y = xy,
bRx y = yx.
(5.66)
This can also be written in terms of the so(8) generators Tab = −Tba used in (4.75)
and given in (4.76):
Tx,y := xayb Tab.
(5.67)
Finally, acting on (5.59) with the transformations of (5.58) and invoking the deﬁning
triality relations (3.114), the [tri(O), 3O] commutators are just given by the natural
action of tri(O) on 3O:
h
( bA, bB, bC), (xv, x∗
s, xc)
i
= ( bAxv, bBx∗
s, bCxc).
(5.68)
This completes the speciﬁcation of the commutators of f4 ∼= tri(O) + 3O. In fact,
the entire discussion in this subsection also works for any other division algebra An
since
sa(3, An) ∼= tri(An) + 3An,
(5.69)
with the commutators given as above. This can also be seen as adjoining the sub-
algebra L2(An, R) = so(n + 1) ⊕ex(An) with its spinor representation.
By analogy with this, making use of the triality principle also allows the Lie
algebra L2(AL, AR) = tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) + AL ⊗AR to be adjoined to its spinor
representation Ψ ∈(AL ⊗AR)2 in order to construct a much bigger algebra [87]:
118

the magic square algebra,
L3(AL, AR) = L2(AL, AR) + (AL ⊗AR)2,
(5.70)
which may be written as
L3(AL, AR) = tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) + 3(AL ⊗AR).
(5.71)
The commutators are deﬁned as follows. First of all, tri(AL) and tri(AR) are Lie
subalgebras. For elements TL = ( bAL, bBL, bCL) ∈tri(AL) and elements5
(Xv, X∗
s, Xc) = (xv ˜xv, x∗
s ˜x∗
s, xc ˜xc) ∈3(AL ⊗AR),
the commutators are given by the natural action of tri(AL),
[TL, (Xv, X∗
s, Xc)] = ( bALXv, bBLX∗
s, bCLXc).
(5.72)
Similarly for TR = ( bAR, bBR, bCR) ∈tri(AR),
[TR, (Xv, X∗
s, Xc)] = ( bARXv, bBRX∗
s, bCRXc).
(5.73)
The commutators between the three copies of AL ⊗AR are as follows:
[(0, 0, xs ˜xs), (0, x∗
c ˜x∗
c, 0)] = ζ
 (xcx∗
s)(˜xc˜x∗

c, 0), (xv ˜xv, 0, 0)] =
 0, 0, (x∗
vxc)(˜x∗
v˜xc)

,
(5.74)
where ζ = ±1 is a constant to be chosen, whose two possible values result in diﬀerent
real forms of L3(AL, AR); selecting ζ = 1 gives the original magic square of compact
real forms in Table 5.1, whereas selecting ζ = −1 gives the Lorentzian magic square
L1,2(AL, AR) [88] of non-compact real forms given in Table 5.3.
Finally, for two elements belonging to the same (AL ⊗AR) summand in (5.71)
the commutator is deﬁned using the natural map
Λ2(AL ⊗AR)i →Λ2(AL) ⊕Λ2(AR) →tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR),
(5.75)
where Λ2(A) for any algebra A denotes antisymmetric linear maps on A. The ﬁrst
5Although a typical element X ∈AL ⊗AR does not factorise into a single tensor product x˜x with
x ∈AL and ˜x ∈AR, it will simplify the notation in this section to write the commutators only
for such factorisable elements. Since a general X ∈AL ⊗AR may always be written as a sum
of such elements, it is easy to ﬁnd the general commutators from those given in this section.

inside tri(AL,R). More explicitly,

xs,ys.
(5.76)
With these commutators the magic square formula (5.71) describes the Lie alge-
bras of the groups presented in Table 5.1 and Table 5.3. This construction ﬁnally
reveals e6, e7 and e8 as the analogues of f4 for octonionic tensor product algebras
C ⊗O, H ⊗O and O ⊗O. By counting dim[tri(AL)] + dim[tri(AR)] + 3nLnR one
ﬁnds that these algebras have dimensions 78, 133 and 248, respectively.
The ζ = −1 case, L1,2(AL, AR), gives the magic square algebra relevent to in-
terpreting D = 3 supergravity as the square of Yang-Mills. It is straightforward to
check the signatures (real forms) appearing in Table 5.3 as follows. A non-compact
real form gnc of a complex semi-simple Lie algebra gC admits a symmetric decom-
position gnc = h + p,
[h, h] ⊆h,
[h, p] ⊆p,
[p, p] ⊆h,
(5.77)
where h is the maximal compact subalgebra. If a compact real form gc shares with
some non-compact real form gnc a common subalgebra, gnc = h + p and gc = h + p′,
and the brackets in [h, p] are the same as those in [h, p′], but equivalent brackets in
[p, p] and [p′, p′] diﬀer by a sign, then h is the maximal compact subalgebra of gnc.
This observation is suﬃcient to conﬁrm that the ζ = −1 construction yields the
real forms in Table 5.3 and that L2(AL, AR) in each case is the maximal compact
subalgebra – see Table 5.2.

The subscripts in parentheses on the exceptional groups are the numbers of non-compact

which is why the number in brackets on the subscript is 128 −120 = 8.

2γµν = 1
2γ[µγν] are the generators
of the Lorentz algebra sl(2, R) ∼= so(1, 2) and the trace on the third line is over the
suppressed spinor indices.
The Lagrangian (5.78) and transformation rules (5.79) exhibit a symmetry known
in the division-algebraic literature as the ‘intermediate algebra’ [87, 89],
int1(AN) :=

( bA, bB, bC) ∈tri(AN)
 bA1 = 0
	 ∼= so(N −1) ⊕ex(AN),
(5.80)
which is int1(AN) = Ø, so(2), so(4), so(7) for AN = R, C, H, O, respectively. The
condition bA1 = 0 in (5.80) corresponds to the fact that in the bosonic sector the
symmetry leaves the gauge ﬁeld invariant, while the so(N −1) piece transforms the
Im(AN)-valued scalar ﬁeld in the fundamental representation:

µ = 0,
δφA = −1

(5.81)
where θij = −θji ∈so(N −1) and θI ∈ex(AN). The fermions and supersymmetry
6Comparing to the ‘master Lagrangian’ (4.116), the gamma matrices γµ here can be obtained as
γµ = −ε¯σµ, with the ¯σµ matrices deﬁned in (4.5) and (4.6).

parameters transform under this symmetry as:
δλA = −1
4θijei(ejλA) + λAθI,
δϵ = −1
4θijei(ejϵ) + ϵθI.
(5.82)
Also, note that int1(AN) can also be written as int1(AN) ∼= der(AN) + Im(AN).
The form of the ﬁrst term in the λA supersymmetry transformation highlights the
vector’s status as the ‘missing’ real part of the Im(AN)-valued scalar ﬁeld. Indeed,
in the free g = 0 theory one may dualise the vector Aµ to a scalar φ0 to obtain a
full AN-valued scalar ﬁeld φA →φA
0 + φA

In this case the following Lagrangian gives equations of motion and Bianchi identities
equivalent to those of (5.78) with g = 0,
L(AN) = −1
2∂µφA∗∂µφA −i¯λAγµ∂µλA,
(5.84)
where φ and λ each take values in AN. The supersymmetry transformations become:
δφA = i Tr ϵ¯λA,
δλA = −1
2∂µφA∗γµϵ.
(5.85)
Equations (5.84) and (5.85) enjoy a global internal symmetry whose Lie algebra
is tri(AN) ∼= Ø, u(1) ⊕u(1), su(2) ⊕su(2) ⊕su(2), so(8) for AN = R, C, H, O,

(5.86)
This sum of the R-symmetry so(N) and the extra algebras ex(AN) is inherited from
the D = 4, 6, 10 minimally supersymmetric theories, which dimensionally reduce to
give N = 2, 4, 8 in D = 3. See Table 5.4 for a clariﬁcation of the various D = 3
symmetry algebras.
After applying the equations of motion and ﬁxing the gauge of Aµ, the g = 0
Yang-Mills theory and its dualised counterpart are equivalent. For a single plane
wave solution to the momentum-space equations of motion with momentum pµ =
(E, 0, E), the gauge ﬁeld can be written as Aµ = (0, A1, 0) (after choosing the
radiation gauge), in which case (5.83) has only one non-zero component, equivalent

to the relation A1 = φ0. Hence the single dynamical degree of freedom carried by
Aµ is of course the exact same degree of freedom carried by the corresponding dual
scalar φ0.
The fermionic equation of motion with pµ = (E, 0, E) has the same form as (4.65),
which removes one of the AN-valued components of the two-component spinor. Thus
the overall on-shell degrees of freedom for the D = 3 free theory are

ψA ∈AN
(5.87)
(whether the vector is dualised or not). These transform under supersymmetry as
δφ = −iϵψ∗,
δψ = iE φ∗ϵ,
ϵ ∈AN,
(5.88)
where ϵ has anti-commuting components ϵa (as does ψ). It is convenient to take
advantage of triality and redeﬁne the parameters θab, θI such that under tri(AN):
δφ = 1

(5.89)
with respect to the so(N) generated by the new θab, it is the supersymmetry param-
eter ϵ that transforms as a vector, while ψ∗is a spinor and φ is a conjugate-spinor
(this is the triality transformation ϱ deﬁned at the end of Section 3.3). Hence θab
corresponds to the so(N) R-symmetry, which rotates the N supercharges or N
supersymmetry parameters into one another in the vector representation, while θI
generates the additional internal global symmetry ex(AN).
Taking an ‘un-dualised’ left SYM multiplet {Aµ ∈Re(AL), φ ∈Im(AL), λ ∈AL}
and tensoring with a right multiplet { ˜Aµ ∈Re(AR), ˜φ ∈Im(AR), ˜λ ∈AR}, as

described in Section 5.1, results in the ﬁeld content of a supergravity theory valued

Dynamically speaking, the R-valued graviton and (AL ⊕AR)-valued gravitino carry
no degrees of freedom, while the 2(AL ⊗AR)-valued scalar ϕ and Majorana spinor
χ each have 2(dim AL × dim AR) = 2NLNR degrees of freedom. The fact that there
are dim[AL ⊕AR] = NL + NR real gravitinos shows that there are N = NL + NR
supersymmetries.
The dynamical degrees of freedom of the supergravity theories are contained in
the doublets ϕ, χ ∈2(AL ⊗AR). Such doublets were demonstrated in Subsection
5.2.2 to be the irreducible representation spaces of the reduced magic square algebra
L2(AL, AR) ∼= so(NL + NR) ⊕ex(AL) ⊕ex(AR)

.
non-compact U-duality group, which acts non-linearly on the scalars, and H is the
maximal compact subgroup of G. The largest linearly realised global symmetry of
these theories is H, so one should expect its Lie algebra h to be L2(AL, AR), and this
indeed turns out to be the case. All the ﬁelds in (5.90) carry linear representations
of H: the graviton hµν is a singlet; Ψµ ∈AL ⊕AR transforms as the vector of the
supergravity R-symmetry so(NL + NR) ⊆L2(AL, AR) and is inert under ex(AL) ⊕
ex(AR); and ϕ and χ transform as the spinor and conjugate-spinor of so(NL + NR)
and by right-multiplication under ex(AL)⊕ex(AR), as shown in (5.92). For example,
in the maximal case of AL, AR = O, these representations are the 1, 16, 128 and
128′ of so(16).
The full non-linear U-duality groups G are ﬁxed by the ﬁeld content and H sym-
metries, as described in the literature [83, 84]. The groups are, of course, those
with Lie algebras L1,2(AL, AR), as presented in the magic square in Table 5.3. The
D = 3 magic square theories are summarised in Table 5.6. The N > 8 supergrav-
ities in D = 3 are unique, all ﬁelds belonging to the gravity multiplet, while those
with N ≤8 may be coupled to k additional matter multiplets [83, 84]. The real
beauty is that tensoring left and right SYM multiplets yields the ﬁeld content of
N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 supergravity with k = 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4: just the right matter content
to produce the U-duality groups appearing in Table 5.3.
The compact symmetries h = L2(AL, AR) can be traced directly back to Yang-
Mills origins.

diagonal rotations of the form

(5.97)
Including the action of these oﬀ-diagonal matrices, the total algebra of linear trans-
formations is given by tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) + AL ⊗AR, i.e. the reduced magic square
algebra L2(AL, AR), as required – compare the above with equations (5.49) and
(5.52). The analogous reasoning also works for χ.
It is interesting to note that the oﬀ-diagonal transformations of (5.97) take Yang-
Mills fermions into Yang-Mills bosons, and vice versa, but are bosonic generators in
the supergravity theory. It is tempting to guess that left-multiplication by (5.97) is
related to the action of the operator Q ⊗˜Q, where Q, ˜Q are the respective super-
symmetry generators of the left and right Yang-Mills theories, and indeed this is the
case. Consider the variation of ϕ under the simultaneous supersymmetry variation
of the left and right theories,
δLδRϕ =

Taking into account the anti-commutativity of the components of ˜ϵ and ψ∗, this may
be written as

Hence all of the compact symmetries h = L2(AL, AR) come from those of the original
Yang-Mills theories.
To further understand the non-linear U-duality groups G in terms of Yang-Mills-
squared will require a brief introduction to division-algebraic projective spaces, since
it turns out that the symmetric spaces G/H, which the scalars parameterise, are in
fact projective planes deﬁned over AL ⊗AR. This is given in the following section.
5.4. Division-Algebraic Projective Planes
Real projective space RPN−1 is the space of undirected lines through the origin in
RN. Each line passes through a unique pair of antipodal points v and −v on the
unit sphere SN−1 and hence RPN−1 is the quotient of SN−1 by the antipodal map,
i.e. the points v and −v ∈SN−1 are identiﬁed:
RPN−1 ∼= SN−1/Z2.
(5.101)
with Z2 = {+1, −1}.
This can easily be generalised to C and H, deﬁning APN−1 for A = R, C, H as
APN−1 ∼=

v ∈AN  v†v = 1
	
/ ∼,
(5.102)
with the equivalence relation ∼deﬁned by v1 ∼v2 ⇔v1 = v2u where u ∈A has
unit modulus: u∗u = 1. In other words APN−1 is the quotient of the unit sphere in
AN by the unit sphere in A:
APN−1 ∼= SNn−1/Sn−1,
(5.103)
where A = An. In the real n = 1 case the unit ‘sphere’ is S0 ∼= Z2 ∼= {+1, −1}.
127

The unit sphere in AN comes with an induced metric
ds2 = dv†dv
(5.104)
whose isometry group G is inherited from the natural action of N × N unitary
matrices U ∈A(N, A) on AN: v →Uv. This metric and its isometries are then
passed onto APN−1, so
G = Isom(APN−1) ∼= A(N, A).
(5.105)
The isometry group G acts transitively on the unit sphere and hence also on APN−1.
Thus APN−1 is a homogeneous space and may be identiﬁed with the coset G/H,
where H is the subgroup of G that ﬁxes any given point, called the isotropy group.
To elaborate on this, any unit vector v ∈AN can be written gvv0 where v0 is some
reference vector, say
v0 =




1
0...
0



,
(5.106)
and gv is a transformation in G. Hence one may parameterise points of APN−1 by
the particular gv required to reach them from v0. However, there is a redundancy in
this description in that v0 is invariant under a subgroup H, meaning these transfor-
mations should be excluded from the parameterisation. Thus as a manifold APN−1
is diﬀeomorphic to G/H.
The group H ﬁxing a point may be seen by considering transformations that leave
the reference vector v0 above invariant. Clearly it is invariant under multiplication
by block-diagonal elements of G of the form
 
1
0
0
h
!
,
(5.107)
where h is (N −1) × (N −1) and hence an element of A(N −1, A). In APN−1 the
vector v0 gets identiﬁed with v0u, so left-multiplication of v0 by
 
u
0
0
±1
!
,
(5.108)
which in this case is equivalent to right-multiplication by u, also leaves the corre-
sponding point of APN−1 invariant. Thus (ignoring subtleties involving orientation-
128

reversing isometries in the real case)
RPN−1 ∼=
SO(N)
SO(N −1) × O(1),
CPN−1 ∼=
U(N)
U(N −1) × U(1)
∼=
SU(N)
SU(N −1) × U(1),
HPN−1 ∼=
Sp(N)
Sp(N −1) × Sp(1).
(5.109)
Having seen that all of the classical compact groups appear as isometries of pro-
jective spaces over R, C, H, it is obvious to guess that the exceptional groups are
isometries of projective spaces over the octonions. Up to one or two subtleties this
idea turns out to be correct. The deﬁnition above does not generalise to O due to
non-associativity, but there is an equivalent deﬁnition that will work for OP1 and
OP2. Consider the matrix
P := vv†,
v ∈AN,
v†v = 1,
(5.110)
for A = R, C, H. This is clearly a projector (P 2 = P) projecting onto the line
deﬁned by v. It is manifestly Hermitian and has unit trace:
Tr(P) = Re Tr(P) = Re Tr(vv†) = v†v = 1,
(5.111)
where the cyclicity property of the real trace was used in the penultimate equality.
Evidently P is invariant under right-multiplication of v by a unit element u ∈A,
v →vu
⇒
P →P,
(5.112)
so v and vu map to the same P. Moreover, any Hermitian rank-1 projector P may
be written as in (5.110) for some v, meaning there is an isomorphism
APN−1 ∼=

P ∈hN(A)
 P 2 = P, Tr(P) = 1
	
.
(5.113)
This may also be taken as the deﬁnition of APN−1, including in the octonionic case
for N = 2, 3. In fact for all four division algebras P may be written as vv† with
v ∈AN satisfying v†v = 1, but in the N = 3 octonionic case there is an additional
constraint that the associator between the three components of v must vanish, i.e.
v =

x
y
z

,
with [x, y, z] = 0.
(5.114)
129

This ensures that the components of P belong to an associative subalgebra of O,
and hence P squares to itself:
P 2 = (vv†)(vv†) = v(v†v)v† = P.
(5.115)
The N = 3 case gives the projective plane AP2, which is of particular interest
since its isometry group has Lie algebra sa(3, A), i.e. the ﬁrst row (or column) of the
compact magic square Table 5.1. The isotropy group is the subgroup that preserves
a reference projector, say
P0 := v0v†
0 =

1
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0

.
(5.116)
This matrix can be written as a sum of its traceless part P ′
0 and trace part,
P0 = (P0 −1
31) + 1
31 =: P ′
0 + 1
31,
(5.117)
with P ′
0 given as in (5.39). Hence, by the discussion in Subsection 5.2.1 the isotropy
groups must have Lie algebras sa(2, A) ⊕ex(A), which agrees with (5.109) for A =
R, C, H; for A = O this implies that
OP2 ∼=
F4
Spin(9).
(5.118)
This manifold is sometimes referred to as the Cayley plane.
Next it is natural to suppose that there exist projective planes
(AL ⊗AR)P2 ∼= L3(AL, AR)
L2(AL, AR),
(5.119)
where L3(AL, AR) is the group resulting from exponentiation of the Lie algebra
L3(AL, AR) and similar for L2(AL, AR) with Lie algebra L2(AL, AR). At ﬁrst sight
this appears to work, since (AL ⊗AR)P2 should have tangent space (AL ⊗AR)2 =
2(AL ⊗AR), which is exactly the Lie-algebra subspace L3(AL, AR) −L2(AL, AR).
However, in general these manifolds (5.119) are not strictly speaking projective
spaces because the tensor product AL ⊗AR is in general not a division algebra, and
hence has zero divisors. One must settle then for taking (AL ⊗AR)P2 to be deﬁned
by equation (5.119) [1, 57, 90]. For more detailed and elegant treatments of magic
square projective geometry see [91, 1, 90, 92] and the references therein.
For the magic square of supergravities the scalars parametrise the symmetric
130

spaces G/H, where G = L1,2(AL, AR) is the U-duality group with Lie algebra
L1,2(AL, AR) and H = L2(AL, AR) is its maximal compact subgroup with Lie alge-
bra L2(AL, AR). Thus, the scalar ﬁelds may be regarded as points in non-compact
Lorentzian division-algebraic ‘projective planes’7
(AL ⊗AR)eP2 ∼= L1,2(AL, AR)
L2(AL, AR) .
(5.120)
Taking AR = R, i.e.
NR = 1, the scalar manifolds can be understood using
Lorentzian Jordan algebras [1, 88]:
h1,2(A) := {H ∈A[3]
 H = ηH†η},
(5.121)
where η = diag(−1, 1, 1).
Then the non-compact Lorentzian plane is just the
Lorentzian analogue of (5.113):
AeP2 ∼=

P ∈h1,2(A)
 P 2 = P, Tr(P) = 1
	
.
(5.122)
Rank-1 projectors P of this form may always be written as
P = −vv†η,
(5.123)
where v ∈A3 is a ‘time-like’ unit vector, v†ηv = −1, whose three components asso-
ciate, as in (5.114). The metric on this space is then inherited from the Lorentzian
metric η on A3:
ds2 = −dv†ηdv = 1
2 Tr(dPdP).
(5.124)
Thus the N = NL + 1 = 2, 3, 5, 9 supergravities resulting from Yang-Mills theories
with NR = 1 have a scalar sector Lagrangian given by
L = 1
4
√−g Tr(∂µP ∂µP),
(5.125)
with
P ∈ALeP2 ∼= G/H =

AL = H

AL = O.
(5.126)
7For example RP2 ∼= SO(3)/ (SO(2) × O(1)) vs. ReP2 ∼= SL(2, R)/ (SO(2) × O(1)).
131

In order to see the form of the Lagrangian (5.125) in terms of individual scalar
ﬁelds (of which there are 2NL in total), one may take the coset representative V ∈
G/H in more conventional language and then write it as an AL-valued 3 × 3 matrix
in the representation of SA(3, AL) described in Subsection 5.2.1. Then simply write
v = V†v0
(5.127)
with v0 deﬁned in (5.106). Then deﬁning P as in (5.123) gives an explicit Lagrangian.
For example, the AL = AR = R case has scalar coset SO(1, 2)/(SO(2)×O(1)), which
is equivalent to the SL(2, R)/ O(2) sigma model presented in equations (2.78)–(2.82).
The coset representative V as deﬁned in (2.78) becomes
V =



cosh ϕ1 + 1
2eϕ1(ϕ2)2
eϕ1ϕ2
sinh ϕ1 −1
2eϕ1(ϕ2)2

sinh ϕ1 + 1
2eϕ1(ϕ2)2
eϕ1ϕ2
cosh ϕ1 + 1
2eϕ1(ϕ2)2



(5.128)
in the deﬁning 3 × 3 representation of SO(1, 2). Then
v = VTv0 =



cosh ϕ1 + 1
2eϕ1(ϕ2)2
eϕ1ϕ2
sinh ϕ1 −1
2eϕ1(ϕ2)2



(5.129)
(with † →T since V has real entries), which leads to the Lagrangian
L = 1
4
√−g Tr(∂µP ∂µP) = √−g(−1
2∂µϕ1∂µϕ1 −1
2e2ϕ1∂µϕ2∂µϕ2),
(5.130)
in agreement with equation (2.80).
The Lagrangian (5.125) is an elegant formulation of the scalar sigma model for
NR = 1, but unfortunately it does not easily generalise to include NR > 1, by the
lack of a projective interpretation of the manifolds (AL ⊗AR)eP2 deﬁned in (5.120).
Such a version of the supergravity Lagrangian is desirable, since writing the theory
over AL ⊗AR makes manifest its Yang-Mills-squared origins.
5.5. Summary
In this chapter the idea of gravity as the square of gauge theory was combined with
the division-algebraic formulation of Yang-Mills to uncover a magic square of D = 3
supergravities. Each theory is obtained by tensoring an AL-valued SYM multiplet
with an AR-valued SYM multiplet and has a U-duality group G whose Lie algebra
132

is the magic square algebra L1,2(AL, AR). This U-duality acts non-linearly on the
scalar sector, which describes a sigma model whose target space is the Lorentzian
‘projective plane’ (AL ⊗AR)eP2.
The next step is to lift this process into higher dimensions, generalising to all cases
in the range 3 ≤D ≤10. Since there are fewer and fewer available super Yang-Mills
theories to ‘square’ as D increases, this results in a magic pyramid of supergravity
theories, whose base in D = 3 is the magic square. This is the subject of Chapter 6.
133

6. A Magic Pyramid of
Supergravities
Having established in the previous chapter that taking tensor products of D = 3
super Yang-Mills multiplets leads to a magic square of supergravities, it makes sense
to generalise this construction to higher dimensions. The goal of this chapter is to
give a uniﬁed presentation of the ﬁeld content and global symmetries of ‘SYM-
squared’ supergravities in the range 3 ≤D ≤10.
In terms of Lorentz representations, the ﬁeld content of a general SYM-squared
supergravity theory is presented in Section 5.1, or in further detail in Table A.1 and
Table A.2 in the Appendix. For each D, NL and NR this ﬁeld content is suﬃcient
to determine the U-duality groups G of the resulting supergravities, as well as their
maximal compact subgroups H. There are two possibilities:
1. If one of the Yang-Mills theories has maximal supersymmetry then the tensor
product results in the unique gravity multiplet with N = NL + NR supersym-
metries, whose U-duality group in each case is familiar from the literature [42].
For example, in D = 4, tensoring NL = 4 SYM and NR = 2 SYM results in
the unique N = 6 supergravity theory with G = SO⋆(12) and H = U(6).
2. If neither SYM theory is maximal then the tensor product gives a supergravity
with N = NL + NR, consisting of the gravity multiplet coupled to additional
matter multiplets.
Again, the U-dualities of such theories are well-known.
For example, in D = 4, tensoring NL = 2 SYM and NR = 2 SYM results in
N = 4 supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets1 [93] with G = SO(6, 2)×
SL(2, R) and H = SO(6) × SO(2)2 ∼U(4) × U(1).
The resulting G and H groups are given in Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2, as well as
Tables 6.3–6.6.
Just as the magic square was described by a single Lie-algebraic formula, one
may deﬁne a magic pyramid formula, which takes as its arguments three algebras:
1In general, N = 4 supergravity coupled to n vector multiplets has G = SO(6, n) × SL(2, R) and
H = SO(6) × SO(n) × SO(2). The factor SO(6) × SO(2) ∼U(4) is the R-symmetry, while the
factor SO(n) rotates the n vector multiplets into one another [93].

division algebras AL and AR, and the Cliﬀord algebra Cl0(N), 1 ≤N ≤nL, nR,
where N = D −2 and nL = dim[AL] and nR = dim[AR].
Each SYM-squared
supergravity’s U-duality group G then has Lie algebra g given by the magic pyramid
formula, and a maximal compact subalgebra h given by a corresponding reduced
magic pyramid algebra.
Section 6.1 contains a brief summary of one of the main the results of Chapter 4:
how a general pure SYM theory may be written over a division algebra An. Then,
Section 6.2 describes how this gives (AL ⊗AR)-valued SYM-squared supergravities.
Finally, Section 6.3 presents the mathematical deﬁnition of the magic pyramid alge-
bra, and a demonstration of how it describes the Lie algebras of the groups presented
in Figure 6.1, 6.2 and Tables 6.3–6.6 in terms of the symmetries of the original super
Yang-Mills theories.
6.1. Division-Algebraic Super Yang-Mills
Every pure super Yang-Mills theory can be obtained by dimensional reduction of
the minimally supersymmetric D = 3, 4, 6, 10 theories presented in Chapter 4, whose
on-shell symmetries are given by the triality algebras tri(An). There it was demon-
strated that a super Yang-Mills theory in D = N + 2 dimensions with N supersym-
metries has ﬁeld content {Aµ, φ¯ı, λI}, or on-shell {a, φ¯ı, ψI}, where:
• ψI ∈SN, with I = 1, · · · , N, are the N fermions, each valued in SN, i.e. the
space of spinors of Cl0(N). These can be packaged as an element f of the
division algebra An ∼= (SN)N, where n = NsN with sN := dim[SN];
• a ∈RN is the on-shell gauge ﬁeld, which may be embedded in a subspace
RN ⊆An;
• φ¯ı are the (n−N) scalar ﬁelds, which may be embedded in a subspace Rn−N ⊆
An, complementary to that of the vector a.
Hence, the on-shell content may be organised into a bosonic sector b and a fermionic
sector f, each of which takes values in An:
b = a + φ = a
¯ae
¯a + φ¯ıe¯ı ∈An,
f ∈An ∼= (SN)N
(6.1)
137

where, for the bosons, the usual index a = 0, 1, · · · , (n −1) labelling the division-
algebraic basis elements is decomposed as
¯a = 0, 1, · · · , (N −1),
¯ı = N, (N + 1), · · · , (n −1),
(6.2)
so that span{e
¯a} = RN ⊆An, while span{e¯ı} = Rn−N ⊂An. For solutions of the
free Fourier-space equations of motion with momentum pµ = (E, 0 · · · , 0, E), the
on-shell supersymmetry transformations are
δb = −iϵf ∗,
δf = iE b∗ϵ,
b, f, ϵ ∈An,
(6.3)
where the components fa and ϵa are Grassmann numbers. The overall symmetry is
so(N)ST ⊕intN(An) ⊆tri(An) – the spacetime little group algebra so(N)ST plus the
internal symmetry intN(An). The spacetime part so(N)ST acts on the three diﬀerent
representations b, f, ϵ via equation (4.103):
δ(b, f ∗, ϵ) = TST(b, f ∗, ϵ) = 1
4θ¯a¯b T
¯a¯b(b, f ∗, ϵ),
(6.4)
where θab ∈so(N)ST, while intN(An) ∼= so(n −N) ⊕ex(An) acts as
δ(b, f ∗, ϵ) = TINT(b, f ∗, ϵ) = 1
4θ¯ı¯T¯ı¯(b, f ∗, ϵ) + TEX(b, f ∗, ϵ),
(6.5)
where
TEX = (0, −bLθI, bRθI) ∈tri(An),
θI ∈ex(An).
(6.6)
It is convenient to deﬁne a new algebra symN(An), made up of those elements of
tri(An) that commute with its so(N)ST subalgebra:
symN(An) :=
n
T ∈tri(An) −so(N)ST
[T, so(N)ST] = 0
o
.
(6.7)
For N > 1 this is clearly just the same as the algebra intN(An), but for N = 1
the algebra so(N)ST is empty, so (6.7) enforces no condition on tri(An) and thus
sym1(An) = tri(An). Hence
symN(An) ∼=



tri(An),
N = 1,
intN(An),
N > 1.
(6.8)
Thus the subtle diﬀerence between the algebras symN(An) and intN(An) is that
symN(An) gives the symmetries of the dualised (i.e. zero coupling constant, g = 0)
138

Yang-Mills theory in D = N + 2 = 3 dimensions: tri(An). In contrast, intN(An)
gives the symmetries of the original ‘un-dualised’ theory with the usual ﬁeld content
{a ∈Re(An), φ ∈Im(An), ψ ∈An}.

Table 6.1.: The internal symmetry algebras of pure super Yang-Mills on-shell: symN(An). Each
slot corresponds to the SYM theory in D = N + 2 dimensions with Q = 2n real
supercharge components.
The N = 1 row describes the symmetries of the D = 3
theory when the Yang-Mills gauge ﬁeld has been dualised to a scalar – compare this to
Table 4.4.
To take account of this dualisation in D = 3, it is useful to give an alternative
deﬁnition of the space of scalars SN
n ⊆An as the space of solutions φ to
δ(φ, 0, 0) = TST(φ, 0, 0) = 0,
φ ∈An,
(6.9)
i.e. SN
n := ker[ bAST], where TST = ( bAST, bBST, bCST). This is just the obvious statement
that scalars are invariant under spacetime rotations. Thus TST naturally decomposes
139

An into two subspaces:
An = VN ⊕SN

(6.10)
where VN is the orthogonal complement of SN
n in An. For D = 3 (N = 1) the
spacetime little group is so(1)ST ∼= Ø and hence TST = 0. This means that every
φ ∈An trivially satisﬁes (6.9), and hence S1
n = An. For D > 3 (N > 1) the space
of scalars SN
n just corresponds to the internal dimensions, Rn−N ∼= span{e¯ı}. In
summary then,
VN ∼=

N = 1,
RN, N > 1,
SN
n ∼=



An,
N = 1,
Rn−N, N > 1,
(6.11)
and the bosonic content becomes
b = a + φ ∈An,
a ∈VN,
φ ∈SN
n ,
(6.12)
where a is the vector and φ contains the scalar ﬁelds.
Just as the magic square was constructed from the triality algebras, which were the
internal symmetries of super Yang-Mills theories, the magic pyramid is constructed
from the algebras symN(An). This explicitly involves the spaces VN and SN
n , as well
as the algebra D, over which Cl0(N) is deﬁned.
6.2. The Supergravity Pyramid
Tensoring an on-shell super Yang-Mills multiplet {b ∈AL, f ∈AL} with another
{˜b ∈AR, ˜f ∈AR} generates a supergravity multiplet, valued in AL ⊗AR. Each
multiplet has global symmetry algebra
so(N)ST ⊕symN(AL,R).
(6.13)
With respect to so(N)ST the tensor products are so(N)ST-modules, while with re-
spect to symN(AL) and symN(AR) they are symN(AL)⊕symN(AR)-modules. Prac-
tically speaking, the tensoring of on-shell ﬁelds can be organised just as in D = 3
(see the previous chapter); the total supergravity content can be arranged into a
bosonic doublet and a fermionic doublet,

The ﬁeld content – in terms of irreducible so(N)ST representations – contained within

For example, the b˜b (i.e. NS-NS) sector is

Note that the p-form ﬁelds of the Ramond-Ramond sector 1

dependent. By virtue of working on-shell all p-forms in the following discussion will
eﬀectively always be dualised to the lowest possible rank consistent with their little
group representations. Thus for example, in terms of Lorentz reps, Bµν →φ, Aµ in
D = 4, 5, respectively. This ensures U-duality is manifest.
The detailed form of these tensor products for D > 3 are summarised in Table A.1
and Table A.2 in the Appendix, where for a given little group representation the
symN(AL) ⊕symN(AR) representations have been collected into the appropriate
representation of h, the maximal compact subalgebra of the U-duality g. For ex-
ample, consider the square of the D = 5, N = 2 super Yang-Mills multiplet, whose
141

global symmetry algebra is so(3)ST ⊕sym3(O) = so(3)ST ⊕sp(2),

(6.17)
On gathering the spacetime little group representations in (6.17), the (generally
reducible) sym3(O) ⊕sym3(O) = sp(2) ⊕sp(2) representations they carry may be
combined into irreducible h = sp(4) representations, as illustrated by the following
decomposition under sp(4) ⊃sp(2) ⊕sp(2):
gµν :
(5; 1) →(5; 1, 1),
Ψµ :
(4; 8) →(4; 4, 1) + (4; 1, 4),
Aµ : (3; 27) →(3; 1, 1) + (3; 5, 1) + (3; 1, 5) + (3; 4, 4),
λ : (2; 48) →(2; 4, 1) + (2; 1, 4) + (2; 4, 5) + (2; 5, 4),
φ : (1; 42) →(1; 1, 1) + (1; 4, 4) + (1; 5, 5).
(6.18)
The algebras g(NL + NR, D) and h(NL + NR, D) may always be decomposed into
symN(AL)⊕symN(AR) and a direct sum of irreducible representations built up from
pieces relating to the left and right Yang-Mills theories. The precise form of these
representations can be obtained as follows. The spacetime little group so(N)ST acts
on the bosonic doublet according to (6.4):

(6.20)
As seen in the previous chapter, these doublets are irreducible representations of
the reduced magic square algebra L2(AL, AR), but in general this algebra does not
commute with the so(N)ST transformations given above. Thus the largest internal
linearly-acting symmetry compatible with the spacetime symmetry is the subalgebra
of L2(AL, AR) that commutes with so(N)ST. Since any element TST ∈so(N)ST may
be written as TST = 1

symmetries. The largest symmetry algebra is that commuting with T
¯i. This will be
described in detail in the following section.
6.3. The Magic Pyramid Algebra
This section is dedicated to giving a mathematical deﬁnition of the magic pyra-
mid algebra PN
1,2(AL, AR). Consider T L
¯i
∈tri(AL) and T R
¯i
∈tri(AR), with ¯i =
1, · · · , (N −1) as usual, satisfying
(T L
¯i T L
¯
j + T L
¯
j T L
¯i )(0, x, y) = −2δ
¯i
¯
j(0, x, y),
∀x, y ∈AL
(6.21)
and similar for T R
¯i ∈tri(AR), with 1 ≤N ≤nL, nR, where nL = dim[AL] and nR =
dim[AR]. This gives a representation of the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(N −1) ∼= Cl0(N) on
each of AL and AR, and up to signs and conjugations determines
T L
¯i = ( bAL
¯i , bBL
¯i , bCL
¯i ) = (bLe
¯i + bRe
¯i, bRe
¯i, bLe
¯i),
T R
¯i = ( bAR
¯i , bBR
¯i , bCR
¯i ) = (bL˜e
¯i + bR˜e
¯i, bR˜e
¯i, bL˜e
¯i).
(6.22)
Then, deﬁning
T
¯i := T L
¯i + T R
¯i ∈tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR),
(6.23)
and deﬁning so(N)ST as the algebra generated by the T
¯i and their commutators
[T
¯i, T
¯
j], the pyramid algebra is given by
PN
1,2(AL, AR) :=
n
x ∈L1,2(AL, AR) −so(N)ST
[x, so(N)ST] = 0
o
,
(6.24)
where
L1,2(AL, AR) := tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) + 3(AL ⊗AR)
(6.25)
is the magic square algebra, with commutators given as in Chapter 5.
Just as
L1,2(AL, AR) has the reduced magic square algebra L2(AL, AR) as its maximal com-
pact subalgebra, that of the pyramid algebra is called the reduced magic pyramid
algebra PN
2 (AL, AR):
PN
2 (AL, AR) :=
n
x ∈L2(AL, AR) −so(N)ST
[x, so(N)ST] = 0
o
.
(6.26)
Any generator in L1,2(AL, AR) – or its subalgebra L2(AL, AR) – commutes with
so(N)ST if and only if it commutes with every T
¯i.
To examine the structure of the pyramid algebra in more detail, the terms in
the Lie-algebraic formula (6.25) can treated individually; in each case the subspace
143

that commutes with T
¯i may be speciﬁed. By deﬁnition, the part of tri(AL,R) that
commutes with T L,R
¯i
is the algebra symN(AL,R). Therefore
[symN(AL,R), T
¯i] = 0,
(6.27)
since [tri(AL), tri(AR)] = 0. As well as the sym subalgebras that commute with T
¯i =
T L
¯i + T R
¯i , the subspace tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) also contains the orthogonal combination
u
¯i := T L
¯i −T R
¯i ,
(6.28)
but this only commutes with T
¯i in the special case N = 2, where there is just one
T1 and one u1, each of which generates a u(1). This corresponds to the fact that
Cl0(2) ∼= C is the only non-trivial commutative Cliﬀord algebra. Overall then, the
condition that each generator must commute with T
¯i reduces tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) to
the subalgebra
symN(AL) ⊕symN(AR) ⊕δN,2u(1).
(6.29)
Next, consider the terms
3(AL ⊗AR) = (AL ⊗AR)v + (AL ⊗AR)s + (AL ⊗AR)c,
(6.30)
where the subscripts refer to elements of 3(AL ⊗AR) as follows:
(Xv, X∗
s, Xc) ∈3(AL ⊗AR).
(6.31)
Then, since the commutators of
TL = ( bAL, bBL, bCL) ∈tri(AL),
TR = ( bAR, bBR, bCR) ∈tri(AR)
(6.32)
and elements of 3(AL ⊗AR) are given by the natural action of tri(AL) ⊕tri(AR) on
3(AL ⊗AR),
[TL, (Xv, X∗
s, Xc)] = ( bALXv, bBLX∗
s, bCLXc),
[TR, (Xv, X∗
s, Xc)] = ( bARXv, bBRX∗
s, bCRXc),
(6.33)
it follows that the condition
[T
¯i, (Xv, X∗
s, Xc)] = 0
(6.34)
144

is equivalent to
( bAL
¯i + bAR
¯i )Xv = 0,
( bBL
¯i + bBR
¯i )X∗
s = 0,
( bCL
¯i + bCR
¯i )Xc = 0.
(6.35)
Written out in full, these conditions are very simple; respectively, they become
(e
¯i + ˜e
¯i)Xv + Xv(e
¯i + ˜e
¯i) = 0,
X∗
s(e
¯i + ˜e
¯i) = 0,
(e
¯i + ˜e
¯i)Xc = 0.
(6.36)
The solution for the X∗
s and Xc conditions is rather simple, due to the Cliﬀord
algebra relations (6.21).
For concreteness, consider the Xc equation ﬁrst.
The
Cliﬀord algebra Cl(N −1) ∼= Cl0(N) is associated with an algebra D via equation
(4.89), as well as an irreducible spinor representation SN with (real) dimension sN.
The representation of Cl0(N) on the division algebra AL,R generated by bCL,R
¯i
is in
general reducible with
AL ∼= (SN)NL,
AR ∼= (SN)NR,
(6.37)
where NL,R := nL/sN. With this in mind, by equation (4.101) the subspace of the
tensor product AL ⊗AR satisfying ( bCL
¯i + bCR
¯i )Xc = 0 is isomorphic as a vector space
to DN[NL, NR] (the linear operators bCL
¯i and −bCR
¯i correspond to the generators Em
and ˜Em in (4.101)). The same is clearly true for ( bBL
¯i + bBR
¯i )X∗
s = 0, since bBL
¯i and
bBR
¯i also give representations of the Cliﬀord algebra on AL and AR, respectively.
For the condition ( bAL
¯i + bAR
¯i )Xv = 0, decompose
AL = VN
L ⊕SN
L ,
AR = VN
R ⊕SN
R,
(6.38)
where SN
L := ker[ bAL
¯i ] = ker[ bAL
ST], SN
R := ker[ bAR
¯i ] = ker[ bAR
ST] and VN
L , VN
R are their
respective orthogonal complements in AL, AR. Note that VN
L ∼= VN
R . Then the
tensor product algebra decomposes into four pieces:
(AL ⊗AR)v = (VN
L ⊕SN
L ) ⊗(VN
R ⊕SN
R)
∼= (VN
L ⊗VN
R ) ⊕(SN
L ⊗SN
R) ⊕(VN
L ⊗SN
R) ⊕(SN
L ⊗VN
R ).
(6.39)
Examining these four subspaces, ﬁrst it is clear that Xv ∈VN
L ⊗SN
R can never
satisfy (6.36), since in this case by deﬁnition ( bAL
¯i + bAR
¯i )Xv = bAL
¯i Xv ̸= 0, and similar
for Xv ∈SN
L ⊗VN
R . The entire subspace SN
L ⊗SN
R trivially satisﬁes the condition
(6.36). This leaves only VN
L ⊗VN
R , whose elements are of the form X
¯a¯b e
¯a˜e
¯b and may
145

be decomposed into a traceless symmetric part, a trace part and an antisymmetric
part:
X
¯a¯b e
¯a˜e
¯b ≡

(X(¯a¯b) −1
v Tr(X)δ
¯a¯b) + 1
v Tr(X)δ
¯a¯b + X[¯a¯b]

e
¯a˜e
¯b,
(6.40)
where v := dim[VN
L ] = dim[VN
R ]. It is easy to check that the trace part satisﬁes
(6.36), since
( bAL
¯i + bAR
¯i )e
¯a˜e
¯a = (e
¯i + ˜e
¯i)e
¯a˜e
¯a + e
¯a˜e
¯a(e
¯i + ˜e
¯i) = 0.
(6.41)
The other terms do not in general satisfy (6.36), except for the antisymmetric part
in the special case of N = 2, since there
X[¯a¯b] ≡X[01]ε
¯a¯b,
(6.42)
where ε
¯a¯b is the 2 × 2 antisymmetric symbol with ε
¯0¯1 = 1, which gives an invariant
as follows:
( bAL
¯i + bAR
¯i )ε
¯a¯be
¯a˜e
¯b = (e
¯i + ˜e
¯i)ε
¯a¯be
¯a˜e
¯b + ε
¯a¯be
¯a˜e
¯b(e
¯i + ˜e
¯i) = 0.
(6.43)
Thus the general solution to ( bAL
¯i + bAR
¯i )Xv = 0 is of the form
Xv = Φ¯ı¯ı′ e¯ı˜e¯ı′ + φ e
¯a˜e
¯a + δN,2 ϕ ε
¯a¯be
¯a˜e
¯b,
(6.44)
belonging to the following subspace of AL ⊗AR:
SN
L ⊗SN
R ⊕Tr(VN
L ⊗VN
R ) ⊕δN,2Pf(VN
L ∧VN
R ) ∼= SN
L ⊗SN
R ⊕R ⊕δN,2R,
(6.45)
where Pf denotes the Pfaﬃan, which is linear only for N = 2 (note that V2
L,R ∼= R2).
Of course, this subspace corresponds precisely to the set of NS-NS scalars from
the tensor product b˜b – see equations (6.15) and (6.40) – since these are just the
components of b˜b invariant under spacetime rotations, i.e. (AL
¯a¯b + AR
¯a¯b)b˜b = 0, which
is equivalent to (AL
¯i +AR
¯i )b˜b = 0. Note that the δN,2R term corresponds to the extra
scalar coming from dualisation of the NS-NS 2-form B in D = 4 (N = 2).
Putting all of this together, ﬁrst the reduced magic pyramid algebra is
PN
2 (AL, AR) = symN(AL) ⊕symN(AR) + δN,2u(1) + D[NL, NR],
(6.46)
with D[NL, NR] ⊆(AL ⊗AR)c, which is the maximal compact subalgebra of
PN
1,2(AL, AR) = PN
2 (AL, AR) + D[NL, NR] + SN
L ⊗SN
R + R + δN,2R,
(6.47)
146

with D[NL, NR] ⊆(AL ⊗AR)s and SN
L ⊗SN
R + R + δN,2R ⊆(AL ⊗AR)v. The
commutators for these algebras are simply inherited from those of the magic square
algebras.
Of course, by construction, for each SYM-squared supergravity in D = N + 2
dimensions the U-duality group G and its maximal compact subalgebra H have Lie
algebras
g(NL + NR, D) = PN
1,2(AL, AR),
h(NL + NR, D) = PN
2 (AL, AR).
(6.48)
Of particular interest in the supergravity theories are the scalar ﬁelds, which pa-
rameterise the coset G/H. The tangent space at a point in G/H can be identiﬁed
with the vector space g −h. From (6.47) this is given by
g −h = PN
1,2 −PN
2 = D[NL, NR] + SN
L ⊗SN
R + R + δN,2R.
(6.49)
This makes sense as the space of scalar ﬁelds, since this is the space of solutions ϕ
to δB = 0 where δ here represents the inﬁnitesimal spacetime little group transfor-
mation given in (6.19). As described in the previous section, δB = 0 if and only
if

Ef ∗˜f ∗

(6.50)
which gives precisely the ﬁrst two equations in (6.36).
Then, by the arguments
above, the space of solutions to the f ∗˜f ∗equation is isomorphic to D[NL, NR] and
represents the R-R scalars, while that of the b˜b equation is SN
L ⊗SN
R + R + δN,2R and
represents the NS-NS scalars – see Table 6.2.
6.4. Compact Pyramid Symmetries
The reduced pyramid algebra has more structure than is immediately obvious;
PN
2 (AL, AR) must always consist of two mutually commuting subalgebras: one is
isomorphic to sa(NL + NR, D) and the other is an extra piece pN(AL, AR), to be
deﬁned below. This can be seen by rewriting equation (4.111) in terms of symN(AL)
and symN(AR):
symN(AL) = sa(NL, D) ⊕exN(AL),
symN(AR) = sa(NR, D) ⊕exN(AR),
(6.51)
147

where exN(AL) is a possible u(1) or sp(1) that commutes with sa(NL, D):
exN(AL) := symN(AL) ⊖sa(NL, D) =

ex(AL),
N = 1
u(1),
(N, nL) = (2, 2), (2, 4), (6, 8)
Ø,
otherwise,
(6.52)
and similar for ex(AR). Then
PN
2 = symN(AL) ⊕symN(AR) ⊕δN,2u(1) + D[NL, NR]
= sa(NL, D) ⊕sa(NR, D) ⊕δN,2u(1) + D[NL, NR] ⊕exN(AL) ⊕exN(AR)
= sa(NL + NR, D) ⊕pN(AL, AR),
(6.53)
where
pN(AL, AR) := PN
2 ⊖sa(NL + NR, D) =



exN(AL) ⊕exN(AR), N ̸= 6
u(1),
N = 6.
(6.54)
Th logic for the ﬁnal equality in (6.53) is as follows. Any element X = −X† of
a(NL + NR, D) may be decomposed as
X =
 
XL
M
−M †
XR
!
,
(6.55)
where XL ∈a(NL, D), XR ∈a(NR, D), and M ∈D[NL, NR]. Hence
a(NL + NR, D) ∼= a(NL, D) ⊕a(NR, D) + D[NL, NR],
(6.56)
which restricts to
sa(NL + NR, D) ∼= sa(NL, D) ⊕sa(NR, D) ⊕δD,Cu(1) + D[NL, NR],
(6.57)
from which equation (6.53) follows2. It is then easy to see that the groups H of
the pyramid diagram in Figure 6.2 correspond to those predicted by the reduced
pyramid algebra construction.
Equation (6.53) is in agreement with the R-symmetry for (NL+NR)-extended su-
2Some care is needed when dealing with the D = 4 commuting ex2(AL,R) pieces. In general the
u(1) absorbed into sa(NL + NR, C) = su(NL + NR) is a linear combination of that contributed
by the δN,2u(1) term and an element of ex2(AL) ⊕ex2(AR). Hence the ﬁnal commuting u(1)
algebras that sit in p2(AL, AR) are also given by orthogonal linear combinations.

persymmetry3 (here meaning speciﬁcally the automorphisms of the supersymmetry
algebra), which in general has Lie algebra
r(NL + NR, D) = a(NL + NR, D).
(6.58)
Each term in the reduced pyramid formula (6.46), and hence the algebra h of
compact U-duality symmetries of SYM-squared supergravities may be traced back
to Yang-Mills:
• Of course symN(AL) and symN(AR) are the internal symmetries of super Yang-
Mills – triality algebras in D = 3 and R-symmetries in D > 3.
• Just as in D = 3, the term D[NL, NR] corresponds to the tensor product of the
left and right supersymmetry generators: Q⊗˜Q. Performing a supersymmetry
transformation (6.3) on both the left and right Yang-Mills ﬁelds gives

(6.60)
but only the components that commute with the so(N)ST transformations
(6.19) and (6.20) can contribute to h. This condition is equivalent to
( bCL

¯i )ϵ˜ϵ = (e
¯i + ˜e
¯i)ϵ˜ϵ = 0,
(6.61)
which is equivalent to the condition in (4.101), giving D[NL, NR].
• Finally, the δN,2u(1) term can be understood as a consequence of the little
group so(N)ST being both commutative and non-trivial only for N = 2. In
this case, any element of so(2)ST acting on the triple of Yang-Mills quantities
(b, f ∗, ϵ) may be written as
TST = 1

As a concrete example consider D = 4, N = 8 supergravity with h = su(8),

has internal symmetry sym2(O) = su(4). Decomposing h = P2

(6.46) (note that the u(1) here corresponds to the δN,2u(1) term, which contributes
since D = 4 ⇔N = 2).
6.5. Non-Compact Pyramid Symmetries
The maximal supergravities populating the ‘spine’ of the magic pyramids in Fig-
ure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 are of course those familiar from dimensionally reducing
D = 11 supergravity, whose U-duality groups Ed(d) (where d = 11 −D) are listed
in Table 2.2. For example, consider once again the maximal D = 4, N = 8 theory
with g = P2
1,2(O, O) = e7(7). In terms of its maximal compact subalgebra h = su(8),
the adjoint of e7(7) decomposes as
133 →63 + 70.
(6.64)
The non-compact generators transforming as the 70 of su(8), which correspond
to the 70 scalar ﬁelds, can then be decomposed in terms of the SYM symmetries
sym2(O) ⊕sym2(O) ⊕u(1) = su(4) ⊕su(4) ⊕u(1) ⊂su(8):

formula (6.47), with C[4, 4] as the R-R sector and S2

Here the non-maximal supergravity U-dualities can be obtained by

• For AR = C, i.e. NR = 1, the compact algebra h is
h = su(N) ⊕ex2(AL) ⊕u(1),
(6.66)
with N = NL + 1. Since there are no scalars in the right Yang-Mills, S2
R = Ø,
the non-compact part g −h becomes

(6.67)
which gives overall4

• Then for AR = H, i.e. NR = 2, the compact algebra h is once again given by
(6.66), but this time with N = NL + 2. In this case g always contains
so⋆(2N) ∼= su(N) ⊕u(1) + Λ2(CN).
(6.69)
For example, for NL = 1, the non-compact part becomes g−h = C3 ∼= Λ2(C3),
while the compact part is h = su(3) ⊕u(1) ⊕u(1), and so the U-duality group
is
g = so⋆(6) ⊕u(1).
(6.70)
Similar logic for NL = 2, 4 gives the remaining U-dualities of D = 4 displayed
in Table 6.3 and Figure 6.1 (note the isomorphisms so⋆(6) ∼= su(3, 1) and
so⋆(8) ∼= so(6, 2)).
These theories were previously obtained in [72] by consistently truncating to the
untwisted sector of the low-energy eﬀective ﬁeld theory of Type II superstrings on
factorised orbifolds, revealing their double-copy structure. The magic D = 4, N = 2
supergravities were also discussed in this context. In particular, the quaternionic
theory originates from a non-factorisable Z2-orbifold compactiﬁcation [72].

g −h = H[NL, 1] + S3

g −h = H + R + R ∼= h′

is plotted again in Figure 6.3 using various isomorphisms to emphasise its overall

This follows the same pattern as the D = 5 layer, only with N + and
N −treated separately due to chirality, giving
g ⊇sl(N +, H) ⊕sl(N −, H),
(6.77)
with equality for N = (N +, N −) = (2, 1), (1, 2), while if neither Yang-Mills is the
maximal (1, 1) theory then
g ∼= sl(N +, H) ⊕sl(N −, H) ⊕R.
(6.78)
Note that in D = 6 when tensoring two minimally-supersymmetric Yang-Mills mul-
tiplets, one may take the two multiplets to have either the same chirality or opposite
chirality:
[(1, 0)L
SYM] × [(1, 0)R
SYM] = [(2, 0)SUGRA + (2, 0)TENSOR],
[(1, 0)L
SYM] × [(0, 1)R
SYM] = [(1, 1)SUGRA],
(6.79)
leading to respective U-dualities given by (6.78):
sl(2, H) ⊕R ∼= so(5, 1) ⊕R,
sl(1, H) ⊕sl(1, H) ⊕R ∼= sp(1) ⊕sp(1) ⊕R.
(6.80)
The details of the above tensorings are given in section A.2. See also [94]. The
chiral theory [(2, 0)SUGRA + (2, 0)TENSOR] is anomalous since the unique anomaly-free
supergravity [95] with N = (2, 0) consists of one (2, 0)SUGRA multiplet coupled to 21
(2, 0)TENSOR multiplets as obtained by compactifying D = 10 Type IIB supergravity
on a K3.
The non-chiral [(1, 1)SUGRA] theory was chosen for Table 6.5 and Fig-
ure 6.1. Note that the chiral (1, 2)SUGRA is also anomalous and adding the required
compensating matter extends the theory to (2, 2)SUGRA [96].
Although they are not considered directly here, it should be noted that the magic
D = 6, N = (1, 0) supergravities (which come coupled to 2, 3, 5, 9 tensor multiplets
and 2, 4, 8, 16 vector multiplets, respectively, as well as hyper multiplets) are closely
related to the magic square and constitute the parent theories of the magic D =
5, 4, 3 supergavities. See [33] and the references therein.

For Type IIB the compact part becomes h = so(2), while g −h = R + R, which
overall yields
g = so(2) + R + R ∼= sl(2, R),
(6.84)
as required; the NS-NS scalar and R-R scalar belong to an SL(2, R)/ SO(2) coset
model. For Type IIA the compact subalgebra h is empty, while the non-compact
part g −h = g = R, corresponding to the single NS-NS scalar. By convention Type
IIA appears in Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2, but one could equally well place Type IIB
at the summit of the pyramid.
6.6. Summary
The goal of this chapter was to obtain the ﬁeld content and global symmetries of
each supergravity obtained from tensoring extended SYM multiplets in D = N + 2
5The D = 7, 8, 9 layers have been skipped since they introduce no new considerations. The ﬁeld
content in these cases may be found in Table A.1 of the Appendix.

spacetime dimensions, with 1 ≤N ≤8. The division-algebraic formalism introduced
throughout this thesis is particularly well-suited to ﬁnding and describing these
global symmetries in a uniﬁed manner.
As demonstrated in Chapter 4, any pure Yang-Mills theory may be formulated
with a single Lagrangian and single set of transformation rules, but with space-
time ﬁelds valued in the division algebra An, where n is half the number of real
supercharges Q. This perspective reveals the role of the triality algebras; each SYM
theory has internal symmetry (or R-symmetry) given by the algebra symN(An),
which is deﬁned in (6.7) directly in terms of tri(An).
Tensoring left/right SYM multiplets valued in the division algebras AL and AR
then naturally leads to NL+NR supergravity multiplets with spacetime ﬁelds valued
in AL ⊗AR. For D = 1 + 2 this yields a set of supergravities with U-duality groups
given by the magic square of Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits. For D = N + 2 > 3,
identifying a common spacetime Cliﬀord algebra Cl0(N) truncates the magic square
to 3 × 3, 2 × 2, and 1 × 1 arrays of subalgebras, corresponding precisely to the
U-dualities obtained by tensoring SYM multiplets in each dimension. Together the
ascending squares constitute a magic pyramid of algebras deﬁned by the magic
pyramid formula (6.24), or equivalently (6.47). The exceptional octonionic row and
column of each level is constrained by supersymmetry to give the unique supergravity
multiplet. On the other hand, the interior 3 × 3, 2 × 2 and 1 × 1 squares can and
do admit matter couplings. These additional matter multiplets are just as required
to give the U-dualities predicted by the pyramid formula. Interestingly, in these
cases the degrees of freedom are split evenly between the graviton multiplet and the
matter multiplets, the number of which is determined by the rule6 k = min(NL, NR).
The magic pyramid supergravity theories are rather non-generic. Not only are
they, in a sense, deﬁned by the magic pyramid formula, they are of course generated
by tensoring the division-algebraic SYM multiplets. It would therefore be interesting
to explore whether they collectively possess other special properties, particularly as
quantum theories, which can be traced back to their magic square origins.
For
example, in the maximal [NL = 4 SYM] × [NR = 4 SYM] case it has been shown
that N = 8 supergravity is four-loop ﬁnite [71], a result which cannot be attributed
to supersymmetry alone. While N = 8 is expected to have the best possible UV
behaviour, as suggested by its connection to N = 4 SYM, it could still be that the
remaining magic square supergravities share some structural features due to their
common ‘gauge × gauge’ origin and closely related global symmetries.
6Thanks to Andrew Thomson for pointing out this rule. Note the subtlety in D = 6 that one
must treat N + and N −separately. Hence, for example, [(1, 0)] × [(0, 1)] has k = 0.
157

One might also seek extensions of the magic pyramid construction which could
account for more generic supergravities.
The magic supergravities of Gunaydin,
Sierre and Townsend [25, 26], for example, might be described by an extension of
the present construction incorporating matter multiplets.
There are also some brief remarks to be made on the geometrical interpretation of
the magic pyramid. As observed in [84] (for the exceptional cases) and described in
Chapter 4, the D = 3 Freudenthal magic square can be regarded as the isometries
of the Lorentzian projective planes (AL ⊗AR)˜P2. In essence the pyramid algebra
describes the isometries of special submanifolds of these spaces. In D = N + 2 > 3,
the action of the Cliﬀord algebra Cl0(N) ⊃Spin(N)ST associated with the spacetime
little group Spin(N)ST breaks the group Spin(nL + nR) that acts (in the spinor
representation) on the tangent space (AL ⊗AR)2 at each point on the projective
plane down to SA(NL+NR, D), where D is the algebra over which Cl0(N) is naturally
deﬁned. This singles out a particular submanifold of (AL ⊗AR)˜P2 for each N, and
the isometries of this submanifold yield the magic pyramid.
Finally, note that to call (AL ⊗AR)˜P2 a projective plane is being rather heuristic;
the H ⊗O and O ⊗O cases do not obey the axioms of projective geometry. Unlike
R ⊗O, the tensor products H ⊗O and O ⊗O are not division algebras, prevent-
ing a direct projective construction. Furthermore, unlike C ⊗O, Hermitian 3 × 3
matrices over H ⊗O or O ⊗O do not form a simple Jordan algebra, so the usual
identiﬁcation of points (lines) with trace 1 (2) projection operators cannot be made
[1]. Nonetheless, they are in fact geometric spaces, generalising projective spaces,
known as ‘buildings’, on which the U-dualities act as isometries. Buildings were
originally introduced by Jacques Tits to provide a geometric approach to simple Lie
groups, in particular the exceptional cases, but have since had far reaching implica-
tions. See, for example, [97, 98] and the references therein. Of course, it has long
been known that increasing supersymmetry restricts the spaces on which the scalar
ﬁelds may live, as comprehensively demonstrated for D = 3 in [84]. Evidently these
restrictions lead to the concept of buildings in supergravity. It may be of interest to
examine whether this relationship between buildings and supersymmetry has some
useful implications.

7. An Octonionic Formulation of
D = 11 Supergravity
Throughout the preceding chapters, a recurring theme has been the connection
between the octonions and maximal supersymmetry.
However, it is fair to say
that the full signiﬁcance of the octonions in string theory remains puzzling.
In
this chapter, in an attempt to approach this problem from a new perspective, the
Lagrangian and transformation rules of D = 11 supergravity are presented written
over the octonions.
The method relies on the fact that a D = 11 spinor with 32 components may be
packaged as a 4-component octonionic column vector [32, 99, 100]. Dimensionally
reducing to D = 4 and D = 3, where the U-duality groups are E7(7) and E8(8),
respectively, the coupling of the 7 or 8 dilatons to the other scalar ﬁelds in the theory
is parameterised by the sets of E7(7) or E8(8) root vectors [101, 102]. The octonionic
nature of the ﬁelds in the Lagrangian suggests a new perspective in which these root
vectors, or ‘dilaton vectors’, are unit-norm octavian integers [40] – the octonionic
analogues of the integers. This involves a novel use of the dual Fano plane, which is
obtained by interchanging points and lines on the Fano plane.
7.1. Spinors and Division Algebras in D = 4, 5, 7, 11
The description of the Lorentz group and its representations in terms of division
algebras An in Chapter 3 can be ‘boosted up’ by a dimension, from D = n + 2
to D = n + 3, where n = 1, 2, 4, 8. First consider constructing gamma matrices in
D = n + 2 modeled on the Weyl basis (2.23) using the generalised Pauli matrices:
γµ =
 
0
σµ
¯σµ
0
!
,
µ = 0, · · · , (n + 1).
(7.1)
These matrices clearly satisfy the Cliﬀord algebra
γµ(γνλ) + γν(γµλ) = 2ηµνλ
∀
λ ∈A4,
(7.2)
159

while each of them anti-commutes with the matrix
γ∗=
 
1
0
0
−1
!
.
(7.3)
Thus the set of n + 3 matrices {γM} := {γµ, γ∗} with M = 0, 1, . . . , (n + 2) satisﬁes
the Cliﬀord algebra for D = n + 3:
γM(γNλ) + γN(γMλ) = 2ηMNλ
∀
λ ∈A4.
(7.4)
The particular case of interest for this chapter is D = 8 + 3 = 11. A Majorana
spinor in D = 11 has 32 components, usually represented as a real column vector.
Alternatively, viewing R32 as a tensor product R4 ⊗R8 ∼= R4 ⊗O ∼= O4, the spinor
becomes a 4-component octonionic column vector

with a = 0, 1, · · · , 7. To see how these are related to a more familiar real 32 × 32
set one can simply take their ‘matrix elements’:

βeb⟩= (γµ)α
β⟨ea|eb⟩= (γµ)α

where γ(5) is deﬁned by

Thus, writing the gamma matrices over the octonions corresponds to an 11 = 4 + 7
split,
SO(1, 10) ⊃SO(1, 3) × SO(7),
(7.9)
with the seven imaginary octonions playing the role of the SO(7) gamma matrices
and the four real γµ, µ = 0, 1, 9, 10, playing the role of the (‘really real’ Majorana)
SO(1,3) gamma matrices. An obvious appeal of the octonionic parameterisation is
that this natural split associates the seven extra dimensions of M-theory with the
seven imaginary octonionic basis elements.
By equation (7.7), left-multiplying λ ∈O4 by the octonionic matrix γM corre-
sponds to multiplying λ’s 32 real components by an ordinary real 32 × 32 gamma
matrix. By successive composition it is clear then that the action of the rank r
Cliﬀord algebra element on λ can be written
γ[M1
γM2 . . . (γMr−1(γMr]λ)) . . .

.
(7.10)
The positioning of the brackets ﬁxes any ambiguities due to non-associativity. For
example, an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation of a spinor λ is
δλ = 1
4ωMNγM(γNλ),
(7.11)
where ωMN = −ωNM.
Deﬁne the operator ˆγM, whose action is left-multiplication by γM, so that the
rank r Cliﬀord algebra element becomes the operator
ˆγM1M2...Mr ≡ˆγ[M1ˆγM2 . . . ˆγMr],
(7.12)
where the operators ˆγM must be composed as
ˆγMˆγNλ = γM(γNλ) ̸= (γMγN)λ.
(7.13)
This ensures that the action of ˆγ[M1M2...Mr] on a spinor is given by (7.10), as required.
To construct the supergravity Lagrangian and transformation rules in this lan-
guage will require real spinor bilinears. These are built using the charge conjugation
matrix Cαβ (which is numerically equal to γ0 but with a diﬀerent index structure):
Cαβ =
 
0

.
(7.14)
161

By deﬁnition this matrix satisﬁes
C(γM)†C = γM
⇔
(γM)†C = −CγM,
(7.15)
where the dagger denotes transposition and octonionic conjugation. Let us deﬁne
¯λ := λ†C.
(7.16)
If λ1 and λ2 are octonionic spinors whose real components are anti-commuting Grass-
mann numbers, then the quantity
Re(i¯λ1λ2) = 1

(7.17)
is Lorentz-invariant. Note that the dagger operation is deﬁned here such that it also
complex-conjugates the factor of i. This accounts for the anti-commuting spinor
components. A general spinor bilinear may then be formed as follows:
Re(i¯λ1ˆγM1M2...Mrλ2),
(7.18)
which as usual will transform as an r-index antisymmetric tensor under Lorentz
transformations.
7.2. An Octonionic Formulation of the M-Theory
Algebra
The fact that a D = 11 spinor with 32 components may be packaged as a 4-
component octonionic column vector [32, 99] prompts the question of how to write
the algebra of D = 11 supergravity (or ‘M-algebra’) using octonionic supercharges
Q. This was explored in [99] where the problem was highlighted that the apparently
natural choice of octonionic matrices could not provide enough degrees of freedom
to account for all of M-theory’s brane charges1.
Another fundamental question that arises when writing the {Q, Q} algebra in this
way is whether or not the usual anti-commutator is really the appropriate object
to study, given that the supercharges are both fermionic and written over a non-
commutative and non-associative algebra O.
1Brane charges are the generalisation of the central charges introduced in Chapter 2 – extra
terms appearing on the right-hand side of the supersymmetry algebra. These terms contain
information about the brane solutions arising in the theory.
162

In this chapter the above problems are tackled by introducing a novel outer prod-
uct, which takes a pair of elements belonging to a division algebra A and returns a
real linear operator on A, expressed using multiplication in A. This product enables
one to easily rewrite any expression involving n×n matrices and n-dimensional vec-
tors in terms of multiplication in the n-dimensional division algebra A. The problem
of the octonionic M-algebra is solved using this product, which allows one to obtain
the correct {Q, Q} bracket.
7.2.1. A New Outer Product
It is interesting to see what other linear operations on Rn look like when written
in terms of the division-algebraic multiplication rule. This was explored in [103],
but a diﬀerent approach will be taken here. Consider the following general problem.
Given some linear operator on Rn expressed as an n × n matrix Mab, one should be
able to ﬁnd a division-algebraic multiplication operator ˆ
M on the division algebra
A such that ˆ
M has the eﬀect of multiplying the components of x = xaea ∈A by
Mab:
ˆ
Mx ≡eaMabxb.
(7.19)
An explicit form for this operator can be found using the inner product (3.26). First
one simply rewrites
Mab = Mcd⟨ea|ec⟩⟨eb|ed⟩
= 1
2Mcd

ea|ec(e∗
deb) + ec(e∗
bed)

.
(7.20)
Now it is clear that the operator
ˆ
M ≡1
2Mcd

ec

 (·)∗ed

(7.21)
(where a dot represents a slot for an octonion) has matrix elements
⟨ea| ˆ
Meb⟩= Mab.
(7.22)
Thus the outer product for division algebra elements may be expressed in terms of
their multiplication rule, deﬁning:
× : A

A →End(A)
(7.23)
ea

eb 7→ea × eb ≡1

With the new product comes the power to rewrite any expression involving n × n
matrices and n-dimensional vectors in terms of multiplication in the n-dimensional
division algebra A.
It is useful to note various equivalent ways of writing the outer product above:
ea × eb = 1

and similarly for the other four possibilities above.
7.2.2. The Octonionic M-Algebra
The anti-commutator of two supercharges in the D = 11 supergravity theory is
conventionally written as the ‘M-algebra’ [104]
{Q¯α, Q¯β} =(γMC)¯α¯βPM + (γMNC)¯α¯βZMN
+ (γMNPQRC)¯α¯βZMNPQR,
(7.26)
where ¯α, ¯β = 1, . . . , 32, PM is the generator of translations and ZMN and ZMNPQR
are the brane charges. The charge conjugation matrix C¯α¯β serves to lower an index
on each of the gamma matrices.
The left-hand side is a symmetric 32 × 32 matrix with 528 components, while
the terms on the right-hand side consist of the rank 1, 2 and 5 Cliﬀord algebra
elements, which form a basis for such symmetric matrices. In terms of SO(1, 10)
representations:
(32 × 32)Sym = 11 + 55 + 462.
(7.27)
The goal is to write this algebra in terms of 4×4 octonionic matrices. However, the
space of octonionic 4 × 4 matrices is of dimension 16 × 8 = 128, and hence naively
does not carry nearly enough degrees of freedom to write (7.26).
The solution to this problem is to use the octonionic Cliﬀord algebra operators
164

ˆγ[M1M2...Mr] deﬁned in the previous section. These operators (including all ranks r)
span a space of dimension 32 × 32 = 1024. In other words, their octonionic matrix
elements are
⟨ea|ˆγM
α
βeb⟩= γM
αa
βb,
α, β = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(7.28)
and treating αa as a composite spinor index ¯α = 1, . . . , 32, the set of {γM ¯α
¯β}
generates the usual real Cliﬀord algebra as in (7.26).
The octonionic matrix elements of the charge conjugation matrix are trivially
Cαaβb = ⟨ea|Cαβeb⟩= Cαβδab,
(7.29)
which can be identiﬁed with the 32 × 32 matrix:
C¯α¯β = Cαaβb = Cαβδab.
(7.30)
Armed with these tools, the right-hand side can then be written over O simply
by replacing ¯α →α and putting hats on the gammas:
(ˆγMC)αβPM + (ˆγMNC)αβZMN
+ (ˆγMNPQRC)αβZMNPQR.
(7.31)
With the identiﬁcation ¯α = αa the left-hand side of (7.26) can also be written in
terms of the composite indices:
{Q¯α, Q¯β} = {Qαa, Qβb}.
(7.32)
Now, the expression (7.31) is an octonionic operator with matrix elements as on the
right-hand side of (7.26), so on the left there must be an octonionic operator
\
{Qα, Qβ}
(7.33)
with matrix elements given by (7.32). The required operator is obtained simply by
contracting (7.32) with the outer product ea × eb deﬁned in (7.23):
\
{Qα, Qβ} ≡{Qαa, Qβb}ea × eb.
(7.34)
The octonionic formulation of the M-algebra is then
\
{Qα, Qβ} =(ˆγMC)αβPM + (ˆγMNC)αβZMN
+ (ˆγMNPQRC)αβZMNPQR.
(7.35)
165

Using the ﬁrst two versions of the outer product given in (7.24), the left-hand side
can be written as
\
{Qα, Qβ} =

(7.36)
The ﬁrst two terms look similar to the more intuitive anti-commutator {Qα, Q∗
β},
explored in [99], but to reproduce the full M-algebra requires all four terms above.
7.3. The Octonionic D = 11 Supergravity
Lagrangian
With the tools described above it is not diﬃcult to rewrite the Lagrangian and
transformation rules of D = 11 supergravity over the octonions. Starting from the
conventional Lagrangian, all one must do is exchange any 32-component real spinors
with their 4-component octonionic counterparts, and exchange any bilinears with
those described above. This gives the following Lagrangian:

7.4. Interlude: The Kirmse and Octavian Integers
The results in the remainder of this chapter will require a brief discussion of octo-
nionic number theory. By analogy with the usual set of integers Z ⊂R, an octo-
nionic integer system I should be an 8-dimensional lattice embedded in O, which is
(preferably) closed under multiplication using the rule inherited from O. The most
obvious example is of course to take octonions whose components are all integers:
I = {x = xaea ∈O | xa ∈Z}.
(7.42)
However, as shown in [105], for a richer number theory one may ask that an analogue
of the unique prime factorisation theorem to hold in I.
For the ordinary set of
integers Z this theorem says that each integer is a product of positive or negative
primes in a way that is unique up to order and sign change. For an analogue of
this theorem to hold in I, it must be ‘well-packed’ [105]; that is, the following two
conditions must hold:
1. no element of O has distance ≥1 from the nearest lattice point of I,
2. the distance between any lattice point and any other lattice point is ≥1,
where the distances are evaluated using the norm in O – see equation (3.24).
One set of octonions that satisﬁes these two conditions is the so-called Kirmse
integers K. These can be described as follows. An octonion x can always be written
as
x = (x0 + xiei + xjej + xkek) + (xi′ei′ + xj′ej′ + xk′ek′ + xl′el′)
(7.43)
(no summation),
where ijk ∈L is a line of the Fano plane and hence i′j′k′l′ ∈Q is the comple-
mentary quadrangle.
An octonion x, written in this way, is a Kirmse integer if
167

{all of x0, xi, xj, xk are integers or all of x0, xi, xj, xk are half-integers} and {all of
xi′, xj′, xk′, xl′ are integers or all of xi′, xj′, xk′, xl′ are half-integers}. As well as being
well-packed, the Kirmse integers form the densest possible lattice in 8 dimensions.
If a ball with radius 1
2 is inserted around each lattice point in R8, then every ball
touches 240 others. In fact, this is none other than the root lattice of the largest
exceptional group E8.
Of particular importance to this paper are the 240 unit Kirmse integers – elements
of K with unit norm – given by:
± 1, ±ei,
1
2(±1 ± ei ± ej ± ek) with ijk ∈L,
1
2(±ei ± ej ± ek ± el) with ijkl ∈Q.
(7.44)
The set of Kirmse integers orthogonal to any particular basis element ea forms a
copy of the root lattice of E7. In particular, the set orthogonal to e0 = 1 is just the
pure-imaginary Kirmse integers, whose 126 unit elements are
± ei and
1
2(±ei ± ej ± ek ± el) with ijkl ∈Q.
(7.45)
This discussion of the Kirmse integers has so far overlooked the vital question of
whether or not they are closed under multiplication. Kirmse himself once stated
that they were. However, it is easy to ﬁnd a counter-example:
1
2(1 + e1 + e2 + e4)1
2(1 + e2 + e3 + e5) = 1
2(e2 + e4 + e5 + e7) /∈K.
(7.46)
Hence K is not closed under octonionic multiplication, a result sometimes referred
to as Kirmse’s mistake [105]. The mistake can be rectiﬁed by the following unusual
trick. For every Kirmse integer x = xaea ∈K exchange the coeﬃcient x0 with any
one of the seven xi. The resulting lattice K′ is just a reﬂection of the Kirmse lattice,
and so is well-packed. However, in this case it is closed under multiplication. In
the literature, K′ has been referred to as the set of octavian integers or the integral
Cayley numbers. They will be used in maximal supergravity theories in the following
section.
168

7.5. Integral Octonions in D = 3, 4 Maximal
Supergravity
7.5.1. D = 4, N = 8 Supergravity
Next, consider dimensional reduction to D = 4, yielding N = 8 supergravity. Drop-
ping the dependence of the ﬁelds on the seven coordinates associated with the seven
imaginary basis octonions (as in equation (7.6)) produces the following bosonic con-
tent:
gMN
→
gµν, ⃗φ, Ai
µ, Ai
j (with i < j),
AMNP
→
Aµνρ, Aµνi, Aµij, Aijk,
(7.47)
where i, j, k run over the seven internal dimensions, while µ, ν, ρ run over the ex-
tended four, and ⃗φ denotes the seven dilatons written as a seven-component vector.
Note that the scalar ﬁelds descended from gMN have not been written here so as to
be covariant with respect to the SO(7) (or GL(7, R)) symmetry associated with the
internal dimensions; instead the dilatonic and axionic scalars have been separated
as ⃗φ and Aij (‘axionic’ in this context means those that are descended from the
oﬀ-diagonal components of the metric).
Denoting (p+1)-form ﬁeld strengths of p-form potentials with superscripts (p+1),
the Lagrangian for the bosonic sector is then:

(7.48)
where the precise deﬁnitions of the ﬁeld strengths and their ‘transgression terms’
are given in [106, 102] and LFFA denotes the terms descended from the topological
term in the eleven dimensional Lagrangian. Note that in the bosonic sector all the
ﬁelds are real, since the octonions have so far only been used in the description of
the fermions. The constant ‘dilaton vectors’ ⃗a, ⃗ai, ⃗aij, ⃗aijk, ⃗bi and ⃗bij parameterise
the non-canonical coupling of the seven dilatons ⃗φ to the other bosonic ﬁelds. For
169

the various potentials, they are given by:
3-potential:
⃗a = −⃗g,
2-potentials:
⃗ai = ⃗fi −⃗g,
1-potentials:
⃗aij = ⃗fi + ⃗fj −⃗g,
⃗bi = −⃗fi,
0-potentials:
⃗aijk = ⃗fi + ⃗fj + ⃗fk −⃗g,
⃗bij = −⃗fi + ⃗fj,
(7.49)
where the vectors ⃗g and ⃗fi are given below. Here they are listed for D extended
dimensions (temporarily letting i, j = 1, 2 · · · , (11 −D) for the next few equations)
so that the expressions may be used later on for D = 3:
⃗fi = 1
2(0, . . . , 0

⃗g · ⃗fi =
3
2(D −2),
⃗fi · ⃗fj = δij
2 +
1
2(D −2).
(7.51)
Returning to D = 4, ⃗g and the seven ⃗fi are then used to build up all of the dilaton
vectors. In particular, ⃗aijk, ⃗bij and −⃗ai, the vectors parameterising the coupling of
the dilatons to the 63 axions, are the positive roots of the U-duality group E7(7)
(where we dualise the seven 2-forms Aµνi to scalars, whose dilaton vectors are −⃗ai).
The dilaton vectors ⃗aij and ⃗bi make up the positive weights of the 56 of E7(7), under
which the 2-form ﬁeld strengths and their duals transform.
Since there is a dilaton for each internal dimension, and the seven internal dimen-
sions are associated with the seven imaginary octonions via (7.6), it makes sense to
consider the seven dilatons ⃗φ themselves to be components of an imaginary octonion
φiei. In this case, the dilaton vectors should also be viewed as a particular set of
imaginary octonions in order to make sense of the scalar products that appear in the
exponential couplings in (7.37). This perspective has some interesting consequences.
Consider the replacement ⃗fi →fi ∈Im(O), where
f1 = 1
2(e1 + e2 + e4),
f2 = 1
2(e2 + e3 + e5),
· · · ,
f7 = 1
2(e7 + e1 + e3),
(7.52)
i.e. fi = 1
2(ei + ej + ek), with ijk ∈L. This amounts only to a change of basis in
170

the space of dilaton vectors. The reason for this particular choice will become clear
shortly. Summing all the fi gives
g = 1
3
X
i
fi = 1
2(e1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + e5 + e6 + e7),
(7.53)
and using the inner product deﬁned in (3.26), one can check that
⟨g|g⟩= 7
4,
⟨g|fi⟩= 3
4,
⟨fi|fj⟩= δij
2 + 1
4,
(7.54)
as required when D = 4.
Now, using (7.49) the various dilaton vectors can be computed in this octonionic
parameterisation. However, before doing so, it will be useful to introduce the concept
of the dual Fano plane. In general, a projective plane P exhibits a duality between
its points and lines, whose roles may be interchanged to obtain a new space eP ∼= P.
For every statement relating points and lines on P there is a dual statement relating
lines and points on eP. For example, just as two points on a projective plane lie on
a unique line, two lines on the plane meet at a unique point. Since the (unoriented)
Fano plane is the projective plane over the ﬁeld Z2, one may interchange the roles
of its points and lines to obtain a dual plane – see Fig. 7.1.
Figure 7.1.: The dual Fano plane eF obtained by interchanging the roles of points and lines on the
original Fano plane. Relabelling the triples 124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713 →1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 gives the plane on the right. Unlike in Fig. 3.1 there are no orientations
given for the lines of the dual Fano plane since it is not used for multiplication.
In practice it makes sense to relabel the lines 124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713
simply as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively, which leads to the plane on the right in Fig.
7.1, whose lines are given by the set eL = {157, 261, 372, 413, 524, 635, 746}. This
relabelling is deliberately chosen so as to match up with (7.52).
Now it is a simple exercise to compute the E7(7) root dilaton vectors, starting with
those whose expressions are simplest. Since a line in eL corresponds to a point in the
171

original Fano plane F, one should expect aijk with ijk ∈eL to correspond in some
way to a point in F. This is indeed the case, since
a157 = e1,
a261 = e2,
a372 = e3,
a413 = e4,
a524 = e5,
a635 = e6,
a746 = e7.
(7.55)
Next consider the octonions −ai, whose labels correspond to points on the dual Fano
plane eF and hence to lines on F. Indeed, one ﬁnds that
−a1 = 1
2(e3+e5+e6+e7),
−a2 = 1
2(e4+e6+e7+e1),
−a3 = 1
2(e5+e7+e1+e2),
−a4 = 1
2(e6+e1+e2+e3),
−a5 = 1
2(e7+e2+e3+e4),
−a6 = 1
2(e1+e3+e4+e5),
−a7 = 1
2(e2+e4+e5+e6),
(7.56)
which matches up with the seven quadrangles complimentary to the seven corre-
sponding lines of F. Computing the rest of the vectors, aijk (ijk /∈eL) and bij (see
Appendix), the whole set populates the unit imaginary Kirmse integers:
± ei and
1
2(±ei ± ej ± ek ± el) with ijkl ∈Q.
(7.57)
Note that the vectors aij and bi corresponding to the 1-form gauge potentials all
have the form
1
2(±ei ± ej ± ek) with ijk ∈L,
(7.58)
which are the weights of the 56 representation, under which the corresponding 2-
form ﬁeld strengths are rotated into their electromagnetic duals.
Putting all of this together means that (after dualisation) the bosonic N = 8

where the sums run over all the vectors listed in Table A.4 in the Appendix, which
correspond to the points, lines and quadrangles of the Fano plane with every possible
± sign combination. As alluded to above, this new parameterisation makes manifest
the relationship between the bosonic ﬁelds and the structure of the Fano plane.
Before moving on to D = 3, there is a useful Fano-plane-based trick for restricting
the roots of E7(7) to those of its maximal compact subgroup SU(8). The adjoint of
172

E7(7) decomposes into SU(8) as:
133 →63 + 70,
(7.60)
so one expects the 126 roots of E7(7) to split into two sets: a set consisting of the
56 roots of SU(8) and the remaining 70 vectors corresponding to the weights of the
70 representation. The trick is ﬁrst to choose a line of the Fano plane – say 124.
As shown in [107], one may then discard the unit Kirmse integers ±e1, ±e2 and
±e4, as well as those associated with the corresponding quadrangle – in this case
1
2(±e3±e5±e6±e7). Take the remaining quadrangles and wherever e1, e2 and e4
appear ﬁx their relative signs according to the following rule: choosing another point
– say e7 – the signs are the same if e7 appears in the quadrangle and diﬀerent if it
does not. This is shown explicitly in Table 7.1.

7.5.2. D = 3 , N = 16 Supergravity
Dimensionally reducing to D = 3 means there are eight internal dimensions, which
are labelled a = 0, 1, . . . , 7. As a result, there are eight dilatons ⃗φ, which are now
written as an octonion φaea. Accordingly, the eight vectors ⃗fa, each of which has
eight entries, become eight octonions:
⃗fa →fa ∈O, with the following chosen
parameterisation
f0 = 1,
fi = 1
2(1 + ei + ej + ek),
ijk ∈L,
(7.61)
where i = 1, · · · , 7 as usual. The total sum is then
g = 1
2(3 + e1 + e2 + e3 + e4 + e5 + e6 + e7),
(7.62)
173

so that the inner products are
⟨g|g⟩= 4,
⟨g|fa⟩= 3
2,
⟨fa|fb⟩= δab
2 + 1
2,
(7.63)
consistent with (7.51) for D = 3.
In D = 3 the 2-form potentials carry no degrees of freedom and the 1-form poten-
tials may be dualised to scalars. Since the metric contains no dynamical degrees of
freedom, all the bosonic degrees of freedom of the theory are carried by the resulting
128 scalars, whose dilaton vectors are −⃗aab, ⃗aabc, −⃗ba and ⃗bab. These make up the
positive roots of the U-duality group of the theory, E8(8).
Again, due to the labelling system chosen in (7.61), one should expect the aabc
with abc ∈eL to correspond in some way to the points of the Fano plane F. This is
indeed the case:
a157 = e1,
a261 = e2,
a372 = e3,
a413 = e4,
a524 = e5,
a635 = e6,
a746 = e7.
(7.64)
Similarly, the ba correspond to points on eF and hence to lines on F: ba = −fa. The
a0i also reﬂect this simple correspondence:
−a01 = 1
2(e3+e5+e6+e7),
−a02 = 1
2(e4+e6+e7+e1),
−a03 = 1
2(e5+e7+e1+e2),
−a04 = 1
2(e6+e1+e2+e3),
−a05 = 1
2(e7+e2+e3+e4),
−a06 = 1
2(e1+e3+e4+e5),
−a07 = 1
2(e2+e4+e5+e6),
(7.65)
as well as the b0i:
b01 = 1
2(−1+e1+e2+e4),
b02 = 1
2(−1+e2+e3+e5),
b03 = 1
2(−1+e3+e4+e6),
b04 = 1
2(−1+e4+e5+e7),
b05 = 1
2(−1+e5+e6+e1),
b06 = 1
2(−1+e6+e7+e2),
b07 = 1
2(−1+e7+e1+e3).
(7.66)
Computing all positive and negative roots (see Appendix) recovers the whole set of
240 unit Kirmse integers, the roots of E8(8):
± 1,
± ei,
1
2(±1 ± ei ± ej ± ek) with ijk ∈L,
1
2(±ei ± ej ± ek ± el) with ijkl ∈Q.
(7.67)
Just as in D = 4 above, in D = 3 one can also write the dualised N = 16 bosonic
174

(7.68)
where in this case the sums run over the vectors listed in Table A.5.
The parameterisation of the vectors ⃗fa in equation (7.61) was chosen because this
leads to dilaton vectors that are easily recognisable as Kirmse integers (since the
Kirmse integers take their structure from the lines and quadrangles of the Fano
plane). However, it would be just as easy to parameterise so as to arrive at the
octavian integers, which are closed under multiplication. In other words, in the
manner above, the dilaton vectors of D = 3, N = 16 supergravity curiously may be
equipped with a multiplication rule, under which they form a closed algebra.
7.6. Summary
The contents of this chapter demonstrate that eleven-dimensional supergravity may
be formulated over the octonions. The octonions are simply used in an alternative
formulation of the usual Cliﬀord algebra for the fermionic sector.
However, the
octonionic parameterisation leads to a new perspective in the bosonic sector upon
dimensional reduction to the maximal supergravity theories in D = 4 and D = 3.
In the D = 4 case one may write the seven coordinates of the internal dimensions
as an imaginary octonion, leading to an interpretation of the seven dilatons as an
imaginary octonion. Upon reduction to D = 3, the 240 dilaton vectors may be
considered as the 240 unit octavian integers, and thus they form an algebra that is
closed under multiplication. This is an interesting result in its own right, although
what it can be used for – or indeed whether it is useful at all – is so far a mystery.
To speculate, the algebra might have some utility in working with D = 3 black hole
solutions, in which dilaton vectors sometimes appear explicitly. However, for now
this is something of an ‘answer without a question’.

8. Concluding Remarks
This thesis has explored and clariﬁed in several contexts the close connection between
division algebras and supersymmetry, as well as exploiting this relationship to clas-
sify and understand the symmetries of various supersymmetric theories. Chapter
4 began with the formulation of D = 3, 4, 6, 10 minimally supersymmetric Yang-
Mills theories over R, C, H, O, which was generalised via dimensional reduction to
a uniﬁed division-algebraic formalism describing all Yang-Mills theories with ex-
tended supersymmetry. Here the role of triality algebras in such theories was made
manifest.
In particular, in D = 3 this formalism gave N = 1, 2, 4, 8 super Yang-Mills over
R, C, H, O, and in Chapter 5 this was combined with the notion of ‘gravity as the
square of gauge theory’ to discover a magic square of supergravities. Speciﬁcally,
tensoring a Yang-Mills multiplet valued over the division algebra AL with another
valued over AR results in a supergravity whose U-duality is given by the magic
square algebra of Freudenthal-Rosenfeld-Tits: L1,2(AL, AR). This result presents a
novel insight into the symmetries of D = 3 supergravity, and hence also into higher-
dimensional theories related to those of D = 3 by means of dimensional reduction.
In Chapter 6 the work of Chapters 4 and 5 was combined; tensoring division-
algebraic Yang-Mills multiplets with extended supersymmetry in all spacetime di-
mensions in the range 3 ≤D ≤10 gives a pyramid of supergravity theories with
the magic square at the base in D = 3 and Type II at the apex in D = 10.
The U-dualities of these supergravities are described by the magic pyramid algebra
PN
1,2(AL, AR), a natural subalgebra of L1,2(AL, AR) deﬁned in terms of the Cliﬀord
algebra Cl0(N) that acts on spinors of the spacetime little group Spin(N), where
N = D −2. This provides a succinct summary of the U-dualities of all supergrav-
ities whose ﬁeld content may be factorised into the tensor product of two super
Yang-Mills multiplets.
Finally, Chapter 7 laid the foundations for an octonionic formulation of eleven-
dimensional supergravity, intended to shed some light on the ‘hidden’ exceptional
symmetries E6(6), E7(7) and E8(8) that appear after dimensional reduction down to
D = 5, 4, 3. This leads to a surprising role for the octavian integers, as well as to
176

lower-dimensional Lagrangians written explicitly in terms of the Fano plane, further
exposing the octonionic anatomy of maximal supergravity.
Throughout the above chapters the octonions resurface time after time in associa-
tion with maximal supersymmetry, and thus also in the context of string theory and
M-theory. Although the full signiﬁcance of the octonions in these theories remains
something of an enigma, it seems that their near-overarching function in such con-
texts is to make Spin(8) triality manifest. Mathematically speaking, the existence
of this triality implies the existence of the octonions, and vice versa [1]; one cannot
be found without the other. Since Spin(8) triality is an essential ingredient in the
very construction of the superstring [39, 16], the octonions are unavoidably built-into
string theory from the outset1. Hence we ﬁnd an exceptional division algebra under-
pinning an exceptional theory of physics, whose symmetries are frequently described
by exceptional groups. The essence common to these three exceptional structures is
their special feature of allowing the rotation of vector/tensor-like degrees of freedom
into spinor degrees of freedom – they all leave room for ‘Boson-Fermion confusion’
[108, 109].
How far this interconnection between octonions and strings can be pushed in order
to more deeply understand the latter is still not clear, but I hope that at the very
least that this thesis provides some useful tools to this end.
1Incidentally, this would make a good retort to anybody suggesting that the octonions are to be
regarded as something of an obscurity or as a red herring – or are ‘not to be let out of the
attic’. At worst, the octonions simply oﬀer an alternative way of treating Spin(8) such that
triality is always manifest.

A. Appendix
A.1. Division-Algebraic Spinor Decomposition
A.1.1. From D = 10 to D = 7, 6, 5: O ∼= H2 ∼= H ⊕H
In dimensions D = N + 2 = 7, 6, 5, the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(N −1) ∼= Cl0(N) is
isomorphic to a matrix algebra over the quaternions H, so it will be useful to write
an octonion as a pair of quaternions. To see how this works, consider a general
octonion x = xaea ∈O, a = 0, 1, . . . , 7, and choose a line of the Fano plane, say 124.
Then H ∼= span{e0, e1, e2, e4}, so write
x = x0 + x1e1 + x2e2 + x3e3 + x4e4 + x5e5 + x6e6 + x7e7
= (x0 + x1e1 + x2e2 + x4e4) + e3(x3 −x7e1 −x5e2 + x6e4),
(A.1)
where e3 has been selected to factorise the terms corresponding to the quadrangle
3567 complementary to the line 124. The octonion x now has the form of a pair of
quaternions, with e3 singled out as the imaginary unit separating the two of them:
O ∼= H ⊕e3H (of course any of the quadrangle’s basis elements could have been
chosen in place of e3, and any line of the Fano plane to begin with).
To write (A.1) compactly, deﬁne the indices
ˆa = 0, 1, 2, 4
and
ˆı = 1, 2, 4,
ˇa = 3, 5, 6, 7
and
ˇı = 5, 6, 7,
(A.2)
so that ‘Fano line indices’ with hats correspond to spacetime directions and ‘Fano
quadrangle indices’ with inverted hats correspond to internal directions. Then (A.1)
becomes
x = xˆaeˆa + xˇaeˇa = (xˆa + e3Γ3
ˆaˇaxˇa)eˆa,
(A.3)
where Γ3
ˇaˆa refers to the 3ˇaˆa-components of the structure constants Γa
bc.
In terms of the H subalgebra spanned by eˆa and its complement H∁∼= e3H spanned
by eˇa, the multiplication rule can be summarised as follows.
• The H subalgebra is closed: eˆaeˆb = Γˆa
ˆbˆceˆc;
178

• Multiplying two elements of H∁returns an element of H: eˇaeˇb = Γˇa
ˇbˆceˆc;
• Multiplying an element of H and an element of H∁returns an element of H∁:
eˆaeˇb = Γˆa
ˇbˇceˇc and eˇaeˆb = Γˇa
ˆbˇceˇc.
An element of H∁may be mapped to a unique element of H and vice versa by
factorising out e3:
e3eˆa = Γ3
ˆaˇbeˇb
⇔
eˆa = −e3Γ3
ˆaˇbeˇb,
e3eˇa = Γ3
ˇaˆbeˆb
⇔
eˇa = −e3Γ3
ˇaˆbeˆb,
(A.4)
where the second two relations come from multiplying the ﬁrst two by e3 on the left
and invoking alternativity.
Using this, the octonionic D = 10 spinor can be rewritten as a pair of quaternions,
ψ′ = ψ + e3χ = ψˆaeˆa + e3(χˆaeˆa),
(A.5)
where ψˆa = ψ′
ˆa and χˆa = Γ3
ˆaˇaψ′
ˇa, while the vector becomes
a′ = a + φ = a
¯ae
¯a + φ¯ıe¯ı,
(A.6)
where the indices ¯a and ¯ı are deﬁned in (6.2). The dimensional reduction is carried
out by dropping the dependence of the ﬁelds on the coordinates associated with the
¯ı indices.
Looking at the action of the Cliﬀord algebra on ψ′ in each dimension:
• In D = 7 the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(4) ∼= Cl0(5) may be generated by left-
multiplication by the set of imaginary basis elements {e
¯i} = {e1, e2, e3, e4} =
{eˆı, e3}. Multiplying by eˆı gives
eˆı(ψ + e3χ) = (eˆıψ) + e3(−eˆıχ)
⇔
 
eˆı
0
0
−eˆı
!

(A.7)
while multiplying by e3 gives
e3(ψ + e3χ) = −χ + e3ψ
⇔
 
0
−1

0
!  
ψ
χ

,
(A.8)
which exactly matches the generators of Cl(4) ∼= H[2] given in Table 4.1, with
(ψ + e3χ) ∈O reinterpreted as (ψ, χ) ∈H2 ∼= S5. This means there is just one
resulting spinor in D = 7, so N = 1.
179

• In D = 6 the set {e
¯i} = {eˆı} generates Cl(3) ∼= H ⊕H, which does not mix ψ
and χ, as (A.7) clearly demonstrates. Hence (ψ, χ) ∈H ⊕H ∼= S+
4 ⊕S−
4 and
this theory has (N+, N−) = (1, 1).
• Finally for D = 5 this set becomes {e
¯i} = {e1, e2}, which acts as a quaternionic
structure generating Cl(2) = H. This time (ψ +e3χ) ∈O is interpreted as two
spinors of the same type (ψ, χ) ∈H2 ∼= (S3)2, so the theory has N = 2.
In each case the higher-dimensional so(8)ST symmetry is broken into the lower-
dimensional so(N)ST ⊕so(8 −N). Decomposing the so(8)ST parameters θab into
θ¯a¯b, θ¯a¯ı, θ¯ı¯and then setting θ¯a¯ı = 0 gives

(A.9)
The θ¯a¯b part is just the inﬁnitesimal action of the spacetime little group Spin(N) ⊂
Cl0(N), just as in equation (4.104), while the θ¯ı¯part is that of the R-symmetry
group Spin(8 −N) ∼= SA(N, D), with Lie algebra sa(N, D) = intN(O). For ex-
ample, in D = 6 the R-symmetry Spin(4) acts as 1
4θ¯ı¯e∗
¯ı (e¯(ψ + e3χ)) with {e¯ı} =
{e3, e5, e6, e7} = {eˇa}; this leads to

This corresponds to the decomposition 8s →(2, 1; 2, 1) + (1, 2; 1, 2) under the sub-
algebra so(4)ST ⊕so(4) ⊂so(8)ST.
By a similar calculation for D = 7 the de-
composition is 8s →(4; 2) under so(5)ST ⊕so(3) ⊂so(8)ST, while in D = 5 the
decomposition is group-theoretically equivalent, but with the roles of spacetime and
internal symmetry reversed: 8s →(2; 4) under so(3)ST ⊕so(5) ⊂so(8)ST.
In dimensions D = 5, 6, the minimal (on-shell) spinor is a single quaternion. Thus
to truncate to the theories with fewer supersymmetries one must simply truncate
O →H, which practically speaking means discarding all ˆa components.
180

A.1.2. From D = 10 to D = 8, 4: O ∼= C4
Next, consider dropping dependence on six of the ten dimensions, yielding the max-
imal N = 4 theory in D = 4 with the on-shell degrees of freedom formulated again
over the octonions. Now the spacetime little group is SO(2)ST ∼= U(1)ST and the
internal symmetry is Spin(6) ∼= SU(4) with Lie algebra int2(O). The on-shell ﬁeld
representations decompose as
Spin(8)ST ⊃U(1)ST × SU(4)
8v →60 + 11 + 1−1
8s →41/2 + ¯4−1/2,
(A.12)
so the D = 10 vector becomes a D = 4 vector 11 + 1−1 and six scalars 60, while the
spinor becomes four fermions 41/2 + ¯4−1/2 transforming as the (anti-)fundamental
of SU(4).
In division-algebraic language the vector 11 + 1−1 corresponds to a complex sub-
space C ⊂O, which is simply C ∼= span{e0, e1}, while the scalars 60 correspond
to the six-dimensional complement S2
8 ∼= R6 = span{e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, e7} of C in O.
This time the barred and underlined indices of (6.2) are
¯a = 0, 1,
¯ı = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
(A.13)
The octonionic ﬁelds a′ and ψ′ can then be rewritten as
a′ = a + φ = a
¯ae
¯a + φ¯ıe¯ı,
ψ′ = (ψ′
ˆa + e1ψ′
ˇaΓ1
ˆaˇa)eˆa := ψˆaeˆa,
(A.14)
so there are four complex spinors ψˆa, written in O by contracting with eˆa, where
here the line and quadrangle indices run over
ˆa = 0, 2, 3, 5
and
ˆı = 2, 3, 5,
ˇa = 1, 4, 6, 7
and
ˇı = 4, 6, 7.
(A.15)
Multiplying the spinor ψ′ = ψˆaeˆa by e¯ı has the following eﬀect:
e¯ı (ψˆaeˆa) = ψ∗
ˆa(e¯ıeˆa) = ψ∗
ˆa(Γ¯ı
ˆaˆbeˆb + Γ¯ı
ˆaˇbeˇb) = ψ∗
ˆa(Γ¯ı
ˆaˆb −e1Γ¯ı
ˆaˇbΓ1
ˇbˆb)eˆb,
(A.16)
181

so its complex components ψˆa get complex-conjugated and multiplied by the matrix
Υ¯ı
ˆaˆb = −Υ¯ı
ˆbˆa := Γ¯ı
ˆaˆb −e1Γ¯ı
ˆaˇbΓ1
ˇbˆb.
(A.17)
The matrices Υ¯ı and Υ¯ı ≡Υ¯ı∗satisfy the relations
Υ¯ıΥ¯+ Υ¯ıΥ¯= −2δ¯ı¯1,
Υ¯ıΥ¯+ Υ¯ıΥ¯= −2δ¯ı¯1,
(A.18)
and so can be used to form the Weyl spinor generators of Spin(6), which are also a
basis for anti-Hermitian, traceless 4×4 matrices, giving the 4 and ¯4 representations
of SU(4):
T [¯ı¯]
ˆaˆb = 1
2Υ[¯ı
ˆaˆcΥ¯]
ˆcˆb = Σ[¯ı¯]

ˆaˇcΣ[¯ı¯]
ˇcˆb .
(A.19)
The transformation of the spinor is then

(A.20)
using equation (A.16) twice. The four complex spinors ψˆa do indeed transform as

δψˆa = 1
2θ01e1ψˆa −1
2θ¯ı¯T [¯ı¯]
ˆaˆb ψˆb.
(A.21)
Note that Γ1
ab, satisfying (Γ1)2 = −1, plays the role of a complex structure, which
deﬁnes an isomorphism O ∼= C4. For the spinor one may view SU(4) × U(1) as
the subgroup of Spin(8) generated by Lie algebra elements θabΣ[ab]
cd
that commute
with the complex structure Γ1, that is, those transformations that treat the 8 real
components of a Spin(8) spinor like 4 complex components. Any real 8 × 8 matrix
that commutes with Γ1, such as Σ[¯ı¯]
ab , can then be written as a complex 4×4 matrix,
like T [¯ı¯]
ˆaˆb above. Equivalently, the matrix Γ1 gives a representation of the Cliﬀord
algebra Cl(1) ∼= Cl0(2) ∼= C, where each ψˆa lives in the spinor representation S2 = C,
and hence O ∼= (S2)4 = C4.
To obtain the N = 2 theory one simply truncates O →H. This translates into
discarding two fermions and four scalars. The internal symmetry of the resulting
N = 2 theory is then the subgroup of SU(4) that preserves the quaternionic sub-
182

algebra and commutes with the complex structure, which is just the R-symmetry
U(2). The N = 1 theory with R-symmetry U(1) can then be recovered by further
truncating H →C, i.e. discarding one fermion and the remaining scalars (or of
course truncating directly O →C).
A completely analogous decomposition with O ∼= C4 takes place in D = 8, i.e.
N = 6, but with the roles of spacetime and internal symmetry reversed; the on-shell
ﬁeld representations decompose just as in (A.12), only with respect to the subgroup
SU(4)ST × U(1) ⊂Spin(8)ST. Here the vector index splitting is
¯a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
¯ı = 6, 7,
(A.22)
corresponding to the decomposition 8v →60 +11 +1−1. Here the complex structure
is the single U(1) R-symmetry generator, given by the simultaneous pair of left-
multiplications: e6(e7ψ).
A.1.3. From D = 10 to D = 9, 3: O ∼= R8
Dimensional reduction to D = 3 results in the N = 8 maximal theory written over
the octonions. This time the algebra decomposition is simply:
SO(8)ST ⊃SO(7)
8v →1 + 7
8s →8.
(A.23)
The spacetime little group here is SO(1), which is trivial, so the vector, fermions
and scalars each contain only a single on-shell degree of freedom. The parameters
decompose as
θab →θ0i, θij
(A.24)
and SO(7) is the subgroup with θ0i = 0. The ﬁelds a′ and ψ′ then break into
a′ = a + φ,
ψ′ = ψaea,
(A.25)
with a ∈R and φ ∈Im(O), and they transform as
δa′ = 1
4θij ei(e∗
ja) −a(e∗
i ej)

+ 1
4θij ei(e∗
jφ) −φ(e∗

(A.26)
183

and
δψ′ = 1
4θije∗
i (ejψ′) = −1
2θijebΣ[ij]
ba ψa.
(A.27)
Thus the fermions and scalars indeed transform as the 8 and 7 of SO(7),
δψa = −1
2θijΣ[ij]
ab ψb,
δφi = 1
2θijφj.
(A.28)
The fermions packaged in ψ may be considered as eight spinors of the trivial Cliﬀord
algebra Cl(0) ∼= R, using the obvious isomorphism O ∼= (S1)8 = R8.
To obtain the N = 4 theory over H, once again, one simply truncates O →H,
leaving a quaternion of spinors ψˆaeˆa and an imaginary quaternion of scalars φˆıeˆı.
This theory has internal symmetry Sp(1)×Sp(1). The N = 2 theory with an internal
U(1) symmetry comes from truncating H →C, further discarding two scalars and
two spinors. Finally, truncating the remaining scalar and the spinor associated with
the last imaginary element results in the N = 1 theory formulated over R, with no
internal symmetry.
Again, the group theory of the dimensional reduction from D = 10 to D = 9 is the
same as that of D = 10 to D = 3, only with the spacetime and internal symmetries
interchanged: for D = 9 the spacetime little group is Spin(7)ST ⊂Spin(8)ST and the
ﬁelds decompose as in equation (A.23). Here the Cliﬀord algebra Cl(6) ∼= Cl0(7) ∼=
R[8] is generated by the set {e¯ı} = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6}, deﬁning the isomorphism
O ∼= S7 = R8.

A.3. Complete List of Octonionic Dilaton Vectors
In order to list the dilaton vectors in a concise form we introduce some additional
terminology and notation. A ﬂag on the Fano plane F (or its dual eF) is a pair (ijk, i),
consisting of an unoriented line ijk and a point i lying on that line. Since the line
ijk is unoriented, we write σ(ijk) ∈L (or eL), where σ(ijk) is some permutation
that puts i, j and k into the appropriate order. There are 7 × 3 = 21 ﬂags on the
Fano plane (or its dual) and we denote the set of these as Fl(F) (or Fl(eF)). Note
that any pair of distinct points i, j on F (or eF) uniquely deﬁnes a ﬂag (ijk, k), since
choosing two points i, j selects a unique line ijk, and giving preference to i and j
over k singles out k.

Table A.4.: Complete list of the octonionic D = 4 dilaton vectors. The vectors (or Kirmse integers)
aijk, bij and −ai are the positive roots of E7(7), while aij and bi make up the positive
weights of the 56 representation. The notation σ(lmn) ∈L means that there exists
some permutation of lmn that gives a line in L (strictly speaking, the lines in L consist
of ordered triples of points).
An anti-ﬂag is a pair (ijk, l), consisting of an unoriented line ijk and a point l
not lying on that line. There are 7×4 = 28 anti-ﬂags and we denote the set of these
as Fl(F) (or Fl(eF) for its dual). Note that any triple of points ijk that is not a line
188

on the Fano plane deﬁnes a unique anti-ﬂag, since the compliment of that triple in
the plane consists of four distinct points, three of which form a line.

Table A.5.: Complete list of the D = 3 dilaton vectors (−aab, aabc, −ba and bab) written as Kirmse
integers. Together all the dilaton vectors make up the positive roots of E8(8).
Using (7.49) one can compute the full set of dilaton vectors.
Because of the
parameterisations (7.52) and (7.61) the resulting vectors exhibit a correspondence
with the Fano plane:
• ai carries a label i corresponding to a point of eF, which maps by duality to a
line ijk on F; the complement of this line is a quadrangle i′j′k′l′ on F; we ﬁnd
that ai = 1
2(ei′ + ej′ + ek′ + el′).
189

• aij (i < j) singles out a ﬂag in (ijk, k) ∈Fl(eF) which maps to a ﬂag (lmn, l) ∈
Fl(F); the resulting vector is aij = 1
2(el −em −en), with the diﬀerent signs
reﬂecting the ﬂag (lmn, l).
• aijk, ijk ∈eL clearly singles out the line ijk on eF, which maps to a point i on
F; we ﬁnd that aijk = ei.
• aijk, ijk /∈eL (with i < j < k) corresponds to an anti-ﬂag A ∈Fl(eF), which
maps to an anti-ﬂag (lmn, l′) ∈Fl(F); the complement of the unoriented line
lmn is an unoriented quadrangle l′m′n′p′ where the point l′ is distinguished
by the ﬂag (lmn, l′); the result is aijk = 1
2(−el′ + em′ + en′ + ep′).
• bi corresponds to a point i on eF, which gives a line ijk on F, giving bi =
−1
2(ei + ej + ek).
• bij (i < j) again selects a ﬂag in (ijk, k) ∈Fl(eF) which maps to a ﬂag (lmn, l) ∈
Fl(F); the complement of the unoriented line lmn is an unoriented quadrangle
l′m′n′p′, which is naturally split into two halves l′m′ and n′p′ by the ﬂag
(lmn, l), since l′ and m′ lie on an unoriented line ll′m′ with l, while n′ and p′
lie on another line ln′p′ with l; the resulting vector is bij = 1
2(el′+em′−en′−ep′)
with the overall sign dictated as follows: looking at the labels i and j of bij we
see that in general i = n′ and/or j = l′.
This is summarised in Table A.4 and, since the D = 3 case is very similar,
its vectors are simply listed in Table A.5. For reference, the sets of lines L and
quadrangles Q of the Fano plane are deﬁned again here:
L := {124, 235, 346, 457, 561, 672, 713},
Q := {3567, 4671, 5712, 6123, 7234, 1345, 2456},
(A.29)
as well as the lines eL of the dual Fano plane,
eL := {157, 261, 372, 413, 524, 635, 746}.
