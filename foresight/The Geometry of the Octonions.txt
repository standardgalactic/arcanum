Preface
This is a book about the octonions, a bigger and better version of the com-
plex numbers, albeit with some subtle properties. Bigger, because there are
more square roots of −1. Better, because an octonionic formalism provides
natural explanations for several intriguing results in both mathematics and
physics. Subtle, because the rules are more complicated; order matters.
Some readers may be familiar with the quaternions, which lie halfway
between the complex numbers and the octonions.
Originally developed
more than 100 years ago to be the language of electromagnetism, an eﬀort
that lost out in the end to the use of vector analysis, the quaternions have
been reborn as a useful tool for applications as diverse as aeronautical
engineering, computer graphics, and robotics. What will the octonions be
good for? This authors believe that the octonions will ultimately be seen as
the key to a uniﬁed ﬁeld theory in physics. But that is a topic for another
day, although hints of this vision can be found here.
This book is intended as an introduction to the octonions. It is not a
mathematics text; theorems and proofs (and references!) are few and far
between. Nonetheless, the presentation is reasonably complete, with most
results supported by at least the outline of the underlying computations.
The only true prerequisite for reading this book is the ability to multiply
matrices, and a willingness to follow computational arguments. Familiarity
with linear algebra is a plus, up to the level of ﬁnding eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. And of course comfort with the complex numbers is a must,
or rather a willingness to become comfortable with them.
The book is divided into three parts. Part I discusses several diﬀer-
ent number systems, emphasizing the octonions. Part II is the heart of
the book, taking a detailed look at a particular collection of symmetry
groups, including orthogonal, unitary, symplectic, and Lorentz groups, all

expressed in terms of division algebras, up to and including the octonions.
As we demonstrate, octonions provide the language to describe the so-called
exceptional Lie groups. Finally, Part III contains a rather eclectic collection
of applications of the octonions, in both mathematics and physics.

Acknowledgments
This book has its origins in the research conducted by one of us (Corinne)
nearly 30 years ago. She in turn introduced her husband (Tevian) to the
octonions more than 20 years ago; we have collaborated on further research
in this area ever since. This book reﬂects Tevian’s eﬀorts to understand
what Corinne has taught him; although most of the actual writing was done
by Tevian, the ﬁnal product has been shaped every bit as much by Corinne,
however indirectly. Rob Wilson has been a part of this collaboration for
the last ﬁve years, and has shown us that the mathematical structure of
the octonions is even richer than we had dreamed, going far beyond the
topics presented here. Special mention and thanks are due our students,
J¨org Schray, Jason Janesky, Aaron Wangberg, Joshua Kincaid, and Henry
Gillow-Wiles, whose published work has been incorporated where appro-
priate, and to our most recent collaborator, John Huerta.
This book is however dedicated to David Fairlie and Tony Sudbery,
Corinne’s collaborators and mentors for her early work relating the octo-
nions to string theory. Our ongoing work with the octonions, including this
book, is a testament to their vision; they got us started.
This book would not have been possible without the ﬁnancial support
and encouragement of the John Templeton Foundation, for which we are
very grateful.
An early draft of the material in Chapter 14 formed the basis for formal
and informal seminars at several institutions, including Mount Holyoke and
Grinnell Colleges in 2002, and Oregon State University in 2004. Sections
11.5, 12.4, and much of Chapters 13 and 15 are based on the authors’
published research, as cited there.

Chapter 1
Introduction
What number systems allow the arithmetic operations of addition, subtrac-
tion, multiplication, and division?
In order to count, we need integers. How high can we count? There
are ﬁnite number systems—and the universe itself may be ﬁnite—but let’s
assume that we can count to inﬁnity, or, more precisely, that there’s no
largest number. In order to subtract, we also need zero, as well as negative
numbers. As we said, we need the integers, namely
Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}.
(1.1)
Integer arithmetic works ﬁne for addition, subtraction, and multiplication,
but what about division? Now we need fractions, or, more formally, the
rational numbers
Q =
a
b : a, b ∈Z; b ̸= 0

.
(1.2)
Now we can indeed do arithmetic. However, we cannot measure the hy-
potenuse of a right triangle, or the circumference of a circle. For those
operations, we need the real numbers, denoted R, which include rational
numbers such as 3 or 1
2, but also irrational numbers such as
√
2 or π.
Are we done yet? No, because there are algebraic equations we still
can’t solve. The simplest example is
x2 + 1 = 0
(1.3)
whose solutions, if any, would be square roots of −1. As you may know,
the complex numbers C consist of both real numbers and real multiples of
i = √−1. Furthermore, all nth order polynomial equations have exactly n
solutions over C (counting multiplicity). The complex numbers may seem
like a mathematical toy; who needs the square root of negative numbers? It
turns out that quantum mechanics is an inherently complex theory; complex
1

2
The Geometry of the Octonions
numbers are an essential ingredient in our current understanding of the
world around us.
Are we done yet? Maybe. What are the rules? Even over the com-
plex numbers, the rules are slightly diﬀerent, as evidenced by the apparent
paradox
i =
√
−1 =

1
−1 =
√
1
√−1 = 1
i = −i
(1.4)
which forces us to rethink the rules for manipulating square roots. Can we
change the rules in other ways?
Yes, we can. First of all, we can drop the requirement that numbers
commute with each other. However counterintuitive this may feel, there
is good reason to suspect that such numbers could be useful, since there
are many physical operations where the order matters. A mathematical
example where order matters is matrix multiplication, where in general
AB ̸= BA. As we will see, this choice leads to the quaternions, H.
Can we go further? Yes, by dropping associativity. Why would we do
that? Well, matrix multiplication is associative, but the cross product is
not. Can you work out ⃗v ×⃗v × ⃗w? Not without knowing which product to
do ﬁrst! As we will see, this choice leads to the octonions, O.
Can we go further? No; going further requires us to give up division.
More precisely, the four algebras R, C, H, and O are the only ones without
zero divisors, that is, nonzero elements whose product is nonetheless zero.
The octonions are thus nature’s largest division algebra. This author
believes that this largest mathematical structure will ultimately be seen as
the key to understanding the basic building blocks of nature, namely the
fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks.
The goal of this book is to introduce the reader to the mathematics of
the octonions, while oﬀering some hints as to how they might be useful in
physics. Let’s begin.

Chapter 2
The Geometry of the Complex
Numbers
2.1
Complex Numbers
Begin with the real numbers, R. Add “the” square root of −1; call it i.
You have just constructed the complex numbers, C, in the form
C = R ⊕R i.
(2.1)
That is, a complex number z is a pair of real numbers (a,b), which is usually
written as
z = a + bi
(2.2)
and which can be thought of as either a point in the (complex) plane with
coordinates (a, b) or as a vector with components a and b.
2.2
History
Complex numbers were ﬁrst used in the 16th century in order to solve
cubic equations, as there are some cases with real solutions that nonetheless
require the use of complex numbers in order to obtain those solutions. The
recognition of the complex numbers as an object worthy of study in their
own right is usually attributed to Rafael Bombelli, who in 1572 was the
ﬁrst to formalize the rules of complex arithmetic (and also, at the same
time, the ﬁrst to write down the rules for manipulating negative numbers).
The term imaginary was introduced only later, by Ren´e Descartes in 1637.

The Geometry of the Octonions
2.3
Algebra
The complex numbers are more than just a vector space; they are also an
algebra, that is you can multiply them together. How do you compute the
product of complex numbers? Simply multiply it out, that is
(a + bi)(c + di) = (a + bi)c + (a + bi)di
= (ac −bd) + (bc + ad)i.
(2.3)
What properties of the complex numbers have we used? First of all,
we have distributed multiplication over addition. Second, i is “the” square
root of −1, that is
i2 = −1.
(2.4)
Third, we have used associativity, that is
(xy)z = x(yz)
(2.5)
for any complex numbers x, y, z. Finally, we have used commutativity, i.e.
xy = yx
(2.6)
to replace bic with bci.1
We deﬁne the complex conjugate z of a complex number z = a + bi by
z = a −bi
(2.7)
thus changing the sign of the imaginary part of z. Equivalently, complex
conjugation is the (real) linear map which takes 1 to 1 and i to −i. The
norm |z| of a complex number z is deﬁned by
|z|2 = zz = a2 + b2.
(2.8)
The only complex number with norm zero is zero.
Furthermore, any
nonzero complex number has a unique inverse, namely
z−1 =
z
|z|2 .
(2.9)
Since complex numbers are invertible, linear equations such as
c = az + b
(2.10)
can always be solved for z, so long as a ̸= 0.
The norms of complex numbers satisfy the following identity:
|yz| = |y||z|.
(2.11)
Squaring both sides and expanding the result in terms of components yields
(ac −bd)2 + (bc + ad)2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2)
(2.12)
(where, say, z = a + bi and y = c + di), which is called the 2-squares rule.
1We are really assuming that multiplication is linear over the reals.
This not only
implies distributivity, but also commutativity between real numbers and the complex
unit, i, which in this case is enough to ensure full commutativity.

The Geometry of the Complex Numbers

2.4
Geometry
Thanks to Euler’s formula,
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ,
(2.13)
polar coordinates can be used to write complex numbers in terms of their
norm and a phase angle θ. (A factor of the form eiθ is called a phase.) That
is, any complex number can be written in the form
z = reiθ
(2.14)
where
r = |z|
(2.15)
since |eiθ| = 1. Each complex number thus has a direction associated with
it in the complex plane, determined by the angle θ.
Euler’s formula provides an elegant derivation of the angle addition
formulas for sine and cosine. We have
(cos α + i sin α)(cos β + i sin β) = eiαeiβ = ei(α+β)
= cos(α + β) + i sin(α + β)
(2.16)
so that working out the left-hand side using complex multiplication, and
comparing real and imaginary parts, yields the standard formulas for the
trigonometric functions on the right-hand side.
We can use (2.16) to provide a geometric interpretation of complex
multiplication. We have
(r1eiθ1)(r2eiθ2) = r1r2ei(θ1+θ2)
(2.17)
so the result of multiplying one complex number, z1 by another, z2, is to
stretch z1 by the magnitude r2 of z2, and to rotate it counterclockwise by
the phase angle θ2 of z2. The same product can of course be reinterpreted
with the roles of z1 and z2 reversed. A special case is that multiplication
by i rotates a complex number counterclockwise by π
2 , without changing
its norm.
Euler’s formula is usually proved by comparing the power series expan-
sions of each side. An alternative proof is obtained by noticing that both
sides of this equation satisfy the diﬀerential equation
d2f
dθ2 = −f
with the same initial conditions. A special case of Euler’s formula is the
famous equation
eiπ + 1 = 0
which relates ﬁve of the most basic symbols in mathematics!

Quaternions
What happens if we include another, independent, square root of −1? Call
it j. Then the big question is, what is ij?
Hamilton eventually proposed that k = ij should be yet another square
root of −1, and that the multiplication table should be cyclic, that is
ij = k = −ji,
(3.1)
jk = i = −kj,
(3.2)
ki = j = −ik.
(3.3)
We refer to i, j, and k as imaginary quaternionic units. Notice that these
units anticommute!
This multiplication table is shown schematically in Figure 3.1. Multi-
plying two of these quaternionic units together in the direction of the arrow
yields the third; going against the arrow contributes an additional minus
sign.
The quaternions are denoted by H; the “H” is for Hamilton.1
They
are spanned by the identity element 1 and three imaginary units, that is, a
quaternion q can be represented as four real numbers (q1, q2, q3, q4), usually
written
q = q1 + q2i + q3j + q4k
(3.4)
which can be thought of as a point or vector in R4. Since (3.4) can be
written in the form
q = (q1 + q2i) + (q3 + q4i)j
(3.5)
1The symbol Q is used to denote the rational numbers, and is therefore not available
for the quaternions.

we see that a quaternion can be viewed as a pair of complex numbers
(q1C, q2C) = (q1 + q2i, q3 + q4i), or equivalently that we can write
H = C ⊕Cj
(3.6)
in direct analogy to the construction of C from R.
3.2
History
The quaternions were discovered by Sir William Rowan Hamilton in 1843,
after struggling unsuccessfully to construct an algebra in three dimensions.
On 16 October 1843, as Hamilton was walking along a canal in Dublin, he
realized how to construct an algebra in four dimensions instead. In perhaps
the most famous act of mathematical graﬃti of all time, Hamilton carved
the multiplication table of the quaternions,
i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1
(3.7)
onto the base of the Brougham Bridge as he passed it. Although the original
carving is now gone, a plaque marking this historic event appears in its stead
(complete with graﬃti!), as shown in Figure 3.2. The inscription on the
plaque reads: Here as he walked by on the 16th of October 1843 Sir William
Rowan Hamilton in a ﬂash of genius discovered the fundamental formula
for quaternion multiplication i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = 1 & cut it on a stone of
this bridge.
The quaternions provided the ﬁrst natural language in which to dis-
cuss electromagnetism. The modern language of vector analysis was not
introduced until the mid-1880s, by Josiah Willard Gibbs, Oliver Heaviside,
and Hermann von Helmholtz. After lengthy disagreement, the language of

Hamilton’s discovery (right).
vector analysis won out, and to this day electromagnetism is taught almost
exclusively using vectorial methods.2
However, quaternions have made a comeback in recent years, as they
provide a natural language in which to describe spatial rotations. Quater-
nions are currently used in applications ranging from aeronautics and
robotics to video games.
3.3
Algebra
The quaternionic multiplication table is almost, but not quite, the vector
cross product. The only diﬀerence is that imaginary quaternions square to
a negative number, whereas the cross product of a vector with itself is zero.
This is not a coincidence. Making the obvious identiﬁcation of vectors
⃗v, ⃗w with imaginary quaternions v, w, namely
⃗v = vxı + vy+ vzk ←→v = vxi + vyj + vxk
(3.8)
(and similarly for ⃗w), then the imaginary part of the quaternionic product
vw is the cross product ⃗v × ⃗w, that is
⃗v × ⃗w ←→Im (vw)
(3.9)
while the real part is just (minus) the dot product ⃗v · ⃗w, that is
−⃗v · ⃗w = Re (vw).
(3.10)
Thus, the quaternionic product can be thought of as a combination of the
dot and cross products! In fact, the use of ı, , k for Cartesian basis vectors
originates with the quaternions, which predate the use of vectors [2].
2A noteworthy exception is the book by Baylis [1].

12
The Geometry of the Octonions
We deﬁne the commutator of two quaternions p and q by
[p, q] = pq −qp
(3.11)
which quantiﬁes the lack of commutativity of the quaternions. For example,
we have [i, j] = 2k. However, the quaternions are associative; it is suﬃcient
to check that
(ij)k = −1 = i(jk).
(3.12)
As always, we have distributivity of multiplication over addition.
The (quaternionic) conjugate q of a quaternion q is obtained via the
(real) linear map which reverses the sign of each imaginary unit, so that
q = q1 −q2i −q3j −q4k
(3.13)
if q is given by (3.4). Conjugation leads directly to the norm of a quaternion
|q|, deﬁned by
|q|2 = qq = q2
1 + q2
2 + q2
3 + q2
4.
(3.14)
Again, the only quaternion with norm zero is zero, and every nonzero
quaternion has a unique inverse, namely
q−1 =
q
|q|2 .
(3.15)
Quaternionic conjugation satisﬁes the identity
pq = q p
(3.16)
from which it follows that the norm satisﬁes
|pq| = |p||q|.
(3.17)
Squaring both sides and expanding the result in terms of components yields
the 4-squares rule,
(p1q1 −p2q2 −p3q3 −p4q4)2 + (p2q1 + p1q2 −p4q3 + p3q4)2
+ (p3q1 + p4q2 + p1q3 −p2q4)2 + (p4q1 −p3q2 + p2q3 + p1q4)2
= (p2
1 + p2
2 + p2
3 + p2
4)(q2
1 + q2
2 + q2
3 + q2
4)
(3.18)
which is not quite as obvious as the 2-squares rule. This identity implies
that the quaternions form a division algebra, that is, not only are there
inverses, but there are no zero divisors—if a product is zero, one of the
factors must be zero.
Since quaternions are invertible, linear equations such as (2.10), where
now a, b, c, z ∈H, can still be solved for z so long as a ̸= 0. But these are
no longer the only linear equations! Consider for instance the equation
d = ax + xb
(3.19)

The Geometry of the Quaternions
13
where now a, b, d ∈C and x ∈H. One solution is clearly
x0 =
d
a + b
(3.20)
provided a+b ̸= 0. Note that x0 is complex. Are there any other solutions?
Consider the special case d = 0, a = i = b. Then any linear combination
of j and k solves the equation!
This turns out to be the generic situation: If a + b ̸= 0, then the
only solution is the complex solution (3.20), but if a + b = 0 there are
additional quaternionic “homogeneous” solutions, which can be added to
the particular solution x0, which is therefore not unique. The situation
rapidly becomes more complicated if some or all of a, b, d are themselves
allowed to be quaternionic, rather than complex.
3.4
Geometry
It is important to realize that ±i, ±j, and ±k are not the only square roots
of −1. Rather, any imaginary quaternion squares to a negative number, so
it is only necessary to choose its norm to be one in order to get a square
root of −1. The imaginary quaternions of norm one form a sphere; in the
above notation, this is the set of points
q2
2 + q2
3 + q2
4 = 1
(3.21)
(with q1 = 0).
Any such unit imaginary quaternion u can be used to
construct a complex subalgebra of H, which we will also denote by C,
namely
C = {a + b u}
(3.22)
with a, b ∈R. Furthermore, we can use the identity (2.13) to write
euθ = cos θ + u sin θ.
(3.23)
This means that any quaternion can be written in the form
q = reuθ
(3.24)
where
r = |q|
(3.25)
and where u denotes the direction of the imaginary part of q.
A useful strategy for solving problems such as the linear equations in
the previous section, which involve both complex numbers and quaternions,
is to break up the quaternions into a pair of complex numbers. Consider
the following examples.

14
The Geometry of the Octonions
We deﬁne conjugation3 of one quaternion q by another quaternion p by
pqp−1. The norm of p is irrelevant here, so we might as well assume that
|p| = 1, in which case p−1 = p
• What is the result of conjugating a quaternion by i?
Write q in terms of a pair of complex numbers via
q = q1C + q2Cj.
(3.26)
Then i commutes with the complex numbers q1C and q2C, but anticommutes
with j. Thus,
iqı = iq1Cı + iq2Cjı = iq1Cı −iq2Cıj = q1C −q2Cj.
(3.27)
Conjugation by i therefore leaves the complex plane untouched, but yields a
rotation by π in the jk-plane. Analogous results would hold for conjugation
by any other imaginary quaternionic unit, such as u.
• What is the result of conjugating a quaternion by eiθ?
Interchanging the roles of i and j in the previous discussion, conjugation
by j yields a rotation by π in the ki-plane, so that
je−iθ= eiθ.
(3.28)
Multiplying both of these equations on the right by j yields the important
relation
je−iθ = eiθj.
(3.29)
Thus,
eiθqe−iθ = eiθq1Ce−iθ + eiθq2Cje−iθ
= eiθq1Ce−iθ + eiθq2Ceiθj
= q1C + q2Ce2iθj
(3.30)
corresponding to a rotation by 2θ in the jk-plane. We will return to such
examples when discussing symmetry groups in Chapter 6.
3Conjugation by p is quite diﬀerent from conjugation of p (which would be p).

Chapter 4
The Geometry of the Octonions
4.1
Octonions
What happens if we include another, independent, square root of −1? Call
it ℓ. Here we go again.
In analogy to the previous construction of C and H, an octonion x can
be thought of as a pair of quaternions, (x1H, x2H), so that
O = H ⊕H ℓ.
(4.1)
Since we are running out of letters, we will denote i times ℓsimply as iℓ,
and similarly with j and k. But what about the remaining products?
Of course, ℓ2 = −1; this is built into the construction. It is easy to
see that iℓ, jℓ, and kℓalso square to −1; there are now seven independent
imaginary units, and we could write
x = x1 + x2i + x3j + x4k + x5kℓ+ x6jℓ+ x7iℓ+ x8ℓ
(4.2)
where xm ∈R, which can be thought of as a point or vector in R8. The real
part of x is just x1; the imaginary part of x is everything else. Algebraically,
we could deﬁne
Re (x) = 1
2(x + x),
(4.3)
Im (x) = 1
2(x −x),
(4.4)
where it is important to note that the imaginary part is, well, imaginary.
This diﬀers slightly from the standard usage of these terms for complex
numbers, where “Im (z)” normally refers to a real number, the coeﬃcient
of i. This convention is not possible here, since the imaginary part has
seven degrees of freedom, and can be thought of as a vector in R7.
The full multiplication table is summarized in Figure 4.1 by means of
the 7-point projective plane. Each point corresponds to an imaginary unit.

ℓkℓ= k,

kℓk = ℓ,
(4.7)
and each of these products anticommutes, that is, reversing the order con-
tributes a minus sign.

History
Remember the Brougham Bridge, where Hamilton carved the quaternionic
multiplication table in 1843? Well, on 21 July 2004, as one of the authors
walked along that very same canal in Dublin... (See Figure 4.2.)
No, that’s not how the octonions were discovered. Hamilton sent a letter
to his good friend John T. Graves the day after his discovery in October
1843. On 26 December 1843, Graves wrote back describing the octonions,
which he called octaves, a name that is still sometimes used.
However,
Graves didn’t publish this work until 1845, shortly after (and in response
to) Arthur Cayley’s publication of his own discovery of the octonions. For
this reason, the octonions are also known as Cayley numbers. Although
Hamilton later vouched for Graves’ priority, Cayley did publish ﬁrst; both
are given credit for independently discovering the octonions.

The Geometry of the Octonions

4.3
Algebra
We deﬁne the octonionic conjugate x of an octonion x as the (real) linear
map which reverses the sign of each imaginary unit. Thus,
x = x1 −x2i −x3j −x4k −x5kℓ−x6jℓ−x7iℓ−x8ℓ
(4.8)
if x is given by (4.2). Direct computation shows that
xy = y x.
(4.9)
The norm of an octonion |x| is deﬁned by
|x|2 = xx = x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3 + x2
4 + x2
5 + x2
6 + x2
7 + x2
8 .
(4.10)
Again, the only octonion with norm zero is zero, and every nonzero octonion
has a unique inverse, namely
x−1 =
x
|x|2 .
(4.11)
As with the other division algebras, the norm satisﬁes the identity
|xy| = |x||y|.
(4.12)
Writing out this expression in terms of components yields the 8-squares
rule, which is no longer at all obvious. The octonions therefore also form a
division algebra.
A remarkable property of the octonions is that they are not associative!
For example, compare
(i j)(ℓ) = +(k)(ℓ) = +kℓ,
(4.13)
(i)(j ℓ) = (i)(jℓ) = −kℓ.
(4.14)

18
The Geometry of the Octonions
However, the octonions are alternative, that is, products involving no more
than two independent octonions do associate. Speciﬁcally,
(xy)y = xy2,
(4.15)
(xy)x = x(yx)
(4.16)
for any octonions x, y. Alternativity extends to products with conjugates,
so that
(xy)y = x|y|2,
(4.17)
(xy)x = x(yx).
(4.18)
The commutator (3.11), deﬁned for quaternions, extends naturally to
the octonions as well. The associator of three octonions x, y, z is given by
[x, y, z] = (xy)z −x(yz)
(4.19)
which quantiﬁes the lack of associativity. Alternativity can be phrased as
[x, y, x] = 0 = [x, y, y].
(4.20)
More generally, both the commutator and associator are antisymmetric,
that is, interchanging any two arguments changes the result by a minus
sign; replacing any argument by its conjugate has the same eﬀect, because
the real parts don’t contribute.
A consequence of alternativity is that the Moufang identities
(xyx)z = x

y(xz)

,
(4.21)
z(xyx) =

(zx)y

x,
(4.22)
(xy)(zx) = x(yz)x,
(4.23)
are satisﬁed, all of which follow from the associator identity
[x, y, zx] = x[x, y, z].
(4.24)
Polarizing (4.10), we obtain an inner product on R8, namely
p · q = 1
2

|p + q|2 −|p|2 −|q|2
= pq + qp = pq + qp
(4.25)
where the last two equalities make use of the properties of the commutator,
which imply that [p, q] = [p, q]. If v and w are imaginary octonions, then
−v · w = vw + wv = {v, w}
(4.26)
where the last equality deﬁnes the anticommutator of v and w. Thus, two
imaginary octonions are orthogonal if and only if their anticommutator

The Geometry of the Octonions
19
vanishes. Furthermore, if v is an imaginary octonion, and x is orthogonal
to v, then xv + vx = 0, that is
x ⊥v =⇒xv = vx
(4.27)
for x ∈O and v ∈Im O, since v = −v.
The analogy with vectors in three dimensions discussed in Section 3.3,
also holds in seven dimensions. Identifying v, w with ⃗v, ⃗w, not only is
there a dot product, given either by (4.26) or equivalently by (3.9), but
there is also a cross product, deﬁned by (3.10). The dot product exists
in all dimensions, but the cross product does not. Which way should the
cross product point in higher dimensions, where the “right-hand rule” isn’t
suﬃcient? The quaternionic and octonionic multiplication table provide an
answer to this question, and it turns out that these are the only possibilities:
The cross product exists only in three and seven dimensions!
4.4
Geometry
As with the quaternions, the units i, j, k, kℓ, jℓ, iℓ, and ℓare by no means
the only square roots of −1. Rather, any imaginary octonion squares to
a negative number, so it is only necessary to choose its norm to be one in
order to get a square root of −1. The imaginary octonions of norm one
form a 6-sphere in the 7-dimensional space of imaginary octonions.
Any such unit imaginary octonion s can be used to construct a complex
subalgebra of O, which we will also denote by C, and which takes the form
C = {a + b s}
(4.28)
with a, b ∈R. We can again use the identity (2.13) to write
ebsθ = cos θ + s sin θ
(4.29)
so that any octonion can be written in the form
x = rebsθ
(4.30)
where
r = |x|
(4.31)
Two unit imaginary octonions s and t which point in diﬀerent directions
(this excludes t = −s) determine a quaternionic subalgebra of O, which we
also denote by H, and which takes the form
H = {a + b s + c t + d s t }
(4.32)

20
The Geometry of the Octonions
where a, b, c, d ∈R.
An important technique when working with the octonions is to work
with what we call generic octonions. Any single octonion x can be assumed
to lie in C, that is
x = x1 + x2i.
(4.33)
A second octonion y lies in H, but adds just one new direction, that is
y = y1 + y2i + y3j
(4.34)
while a third can be assumed to take the form
z = z1 + z2i + z3j + z4k + z8ℓ
(4.35)
that is, a general element of H plus one further direction. Only with four
or more octonions is it necessary to use the full eight dimensions of O! This
approach makes it obvious that any products involving no more than two
distinct octonions (or their conjugates) must associate—they lie in H! But
this is just alternativity!
It is often useful to consider octonions as vectors in R8. The norm of an
octonion is precisely the same as its vector norm. But the dot product can
be obtained from the norm by a process known as polarization, as follows.
If ⃗v, ⃗w are vectors in Rn, we have
|⃗v + ⃗w|2 = (⃗v + ⃗w) · (⃗v + ⃗w)
= ⃗v · ⃗v + 2⃗v · ⃗w + ⃗w · ⃗w
= |⃗v|2 + |⃗w|2 + 2⃗v · ⃗w
(4.36)
which can be solved for the last term.
By analogy, the dot product of
two octonions is given by (4.25). For imaginary octonions, orthogonality is
equivalent to anticommutativity, that is,
x · y = 0 ⇐⇒x y = −y x
(x, y ∈Im O)
(4.37)
which in turn implies that
xy = y x = y x = −x y
(4.38)
so that orthogonality of imaginary octonions is also equivalent to their
product being pure imaginary. We can therefore use the dot product to
ensure that the product st in (4.32) is pure imaginary: If not, simply
replace t by its orthogonal component t −(t · s) s (rescaled to have norm
one).
What about the cross product? The cross product of two vectors in R3
points in the unique direction (up to sign) orthogonal to the plane spanned

The Geometry of the Octonions
21
by the given vectors. In higher dimensions, there is in general no such pre-
ferred direction; there are many directions perpendicular to a given plane.
It is therefore somewhat surprising that restricting the octonionic product
to imaginary octonions yields a cross product in R7 with the usual proper-
ties (which are essentially linearity, anticommutativity, and orthogonality
to each original vector; there is also a condition on the norm of the cross
product). Remarkably, such products exist only in R3 and R7, correspond-
ing to imaginary quaternions and octonions, respectively.
One way to specify a unique direction in Rn is to give n −1 directions
orthogonal to it. One might therefore suspect that there is a generalized
“cross product” in Rn involving n−1 vectors. This is correct; the resulting
product is most easily described in the language of diﬀerential forms. But
there is precisely one further “generalized cross product” of more than two
vectors, namely a product of three vectors in R8, which also turns out to
be related to the octonions. This triple cross product is deﬁned by
x × y × z = 1
2(x(yz) −z(yx))
(4.39)
for any octonions x, y, z. (Note that this is not an iterated cross product,
but a product directly deﬁned on three factors.)
The real part of this
product deﬁnes the associative 3-form Φ, namely
Φ(x, y, z) = Re (x × y × z) = 1
2 Re ([x, y]z)
(4.40)
which we will use later. (The last equality follows by direct computation.)
As with quaternions, a useful strategy for solving problems is to break
up the octonions into complex or quaternionic pieces. We have
x = x1H + x2Hℓ
= x1C + x2Ci + x3Cj + x4Ck
(4.41)
where x1H, x2H ∈H and x1C, x2C, x3C, x4C ∈C, and where our default conven-
tions are that H is the quaternionic subalgebra generated by i, j, k, but C
is the complex subalgebra determined by ℓ.
• What is the result of conjugating an octonion by ℓ?
First of all, there are no associativity issues here since there are only
two octonions involved, namely ℓand x. The easiest way to work out this
result is to expand x as in (4.2), noting that ℓanticommutes with each term
except the ﬁrst and last, so that
ℓyℓ= y1 −y2i −y3j −y4k −y5kℓ−y6jℓ−y7iℓ+ y8ℓ.
(4.42)

22
The Geometry of the Octonions
As a special case, for q ∈H we have
ℓqℓ= q
(4.43)
and similarly
ℓ(qℓ)ℓ= qℓ
(4.44)
or equivalently
ℓq = qℓ,
(4.45)
ℓ(qℓ) = −q.
(4.46)
These last two expressions are pieces of the general multiplication rule,
which can be expressed in the form
(x1H + x2Hℓ)(y1H + y2Hℓ) = (x1Hy1H −y2Hx2H) + (y2Hx1H + x2Hy1H)ℓ
(4.47)
and from which (4.43) and (4.44) could have been derived, in the form
ℓ(y1H + y2Hℓ)ℓ= y1H + y2Hℓ.
(4.48)
• What is the result of conjugating an octonion by eℓθ?
This follows immediately from the similar computation (3.30) over the
quaternions. Write x in terms of four complex numbers as above. Looking
ﬁrst at the quaternionic subalgebra containing i and ℓ, and then replacing i
in turn with j and k, leads us to
eℓθxe−ℓθ = eℓθx1Ce−ℓθ + eℓθx2Cie−ℓθ + eℓθx3Cje−ℓθ + eℓθx4Cke−ℓθ
= x1C + x2Ce2ℓθi + x3Ce2ℓθj + x4Ce2ℓθk.
(4.49)
As we will see later, this operation corresponds to a rotation by 2θ in three
planes at once!

Chapter 5
Other Number Systems
5.1
The Cayley–Dickson Process
We have constructed the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octo-
nions by doubling a smaller algebra. We have
C = R ⊕Ri,
(5.1)
H = C ⊕Cj,
(5.2)
O = H ⊕Hℓ.
(5.3)
We can emphasize this doubling, using a slightly diﬀerent notation.
A
complex number z is equivalent to a pair of real numbers, its real and
imaginary parts. So we can write
z = (x, y)
(5.4)
corresponding in more traditional language to z = x+iy. Conjugation and
complex multiplication then become
(a, b) = (a, −b),
(5.5)
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac −bd, bc + ad),
(5.6)
(a, b)(a, b) = (a2 + b2, 0).
(5.7)
A quaternion q can be written as a pair of complex numbers,
q = (z, w)
(5.8)
corresponding to q = z + wj. Conjugation now takes the form
(a, b) = (a, −b)
(5.9)
but what about quaternionic multiplication? Working out (a + bj)(c + dj)
with a, b, c, d ∈C, we see that
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac −bd, ad + bc)
(5.10)
23

24
The Geometry of the Octonions
so that
(a, b)(a, b) = (|a|2 + |b|2, 0).
(5.11)
Finally, if we write an octonion p as two quaternions (q, r), corresponding
to p = q + rℓ, we obtain
(a, b) = (a, −b),
(5.12)
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac −db, da + bc),
(5.13)
(a, b)(a, b) = (|a|2 + |b|2, 0).
(5.14)
All of the above constructions are special cases of the Cayley–Dickson
process, for which
(a, b) = (a, −b),
(5.15)
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac −ϵdb, da + bc),
(5.16)
(a, b)(a, b) = (|a|2 + ϵ|b|2, 0),
(5.17)
where ϵ = ±1. We can use this construction to generate larger algebras
from smaller ones, by making successive choices of ϵ at each step.
5.2
Sedenions
What happens if we continue this process? We deﬁne the sedenions by
considering pairs of octonions,
s = (p, q)
(5.18)
with p, q ∈O. Sedenion multiplication is deﬁned by the Cayley–Dickson
process, with ϵ = 1, so we have
(a, b) = (a, −b),
(5.19)
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac −db, da + bc),
(5.20)
(a, b)(a, b) = (|a|2 + |b|2, 0).
(5.21)
If we deﬁne the special element
e = (0, 1)
(5.22)
then we could also write
s = p + qe
(5.23)
since
(p, 0)(1, 0) = (p, 0),
(5.24)
(q, 0)(0, 1) = (0, q).
(5.25)

Other Number Systems
25
The sedenions possess some curious properties. They are of course nei-
ther commutative nor associative, since they contain a copy of the octo-
nions. And they do possess a positive-deﬁnite inner product; the norm ss
of any nonzero sedenion s is strictly positive. However, the sedenions con-
tain zero divisors, that is, nonzero elements whose product is nonetheless
zero. For example, we have
(iℓ+ je)(jℓ+ ie) = (iℓ, j)(jℓ, i)
=

(iℓ)(jℓ) + ij, i(iℓ) −j(jℓ)

= (−k + k, −ℓ+ ℓ) = 0.
(5.26)
Thus, the sedenions are not a composition algebra, as they fail to satisfy
the identity
|pq| = |p| |q|
(5.27)
and they are not a division algebra, since, for example, zero divisors such
as iℓ+ je cannot have an inverse.
5.3
The Hurwitz Theorem
A composition algebra K possesses a norm, that is a nondegenerate
quadratic form satisfying the identity1
|pq|2 = |p|2|q|2
(5.28)
for all p, q ∈K. The Hurwitz Theorem, published posthumously by Adolf
Hurwitz in 1923, states that the reals, complexes, quaternions, and octo-
nions are the only real composition algebras with positive-deﬁnite norm,
and hence the only composition algebras without zero divisors. That is,
the only such algebras that contain R are K = R, C, H, O.
More generally, all real composition algebras can be obtained from the
Cayley–Dickson process—and must have dimension 1, 2, 4 or 8. Compo-
sition algebras of dimension 1 or 2 are both commutative and associative,
composition algebras of dimension 4 are associative but not commutative,
and composition algebras of dimension 8 are neither.
The proof of the
Hurwitz Theorem amounts to showing that the Cayley–Dickson process
can only yield a composition algebra starting from an associative algebra.
1More correctly, the quadratic form acting on an element q ∈K gives the squared norm
|q|2 of q, which can however be positive, negative, or zero; the norm |q| of q makes sense
only in the positive-deﬁnite case.

26
The Geometry of the Octonions
The Hurwitz theorem does however leave open the possibility of
composition algebras other than R, C, H, O, so long as the norm is not
positive-deﬁnite (or negative-deﬁnite, which amounts to the same thing).
Furthermore, all such algebras can be constructed using the Cayley–Dickson
process, making suitable choices of ϵ at each step. Starting with the reals,
which are 1-dimensional, we can apply the Cayley–Dickson process up
to three times.
Remarkably, however, only three distinct new composi-
tion algebras are obtained, the so-called split versions of the composition
algebras.
5.4
Split Complex Numbers
Start with the real numbers, and apply the Cayley–Dickson process with
ϵ = −1.
The resulting algebra is known as the split complex numbers,
denoted C′, and satisﬁes
C′ = R ⊕RL
(5.29)
where
L2 = 1
(5.30)
rather than −1. What are the properties of such numbers?
A general element of C′ takes the form a + bL, with a, b ∈R. Just
like the ordinary complex numbers, the split complex numbers are both
commutative and associative. The (squared) norm is given by
|a + bL|2 = (a + bL)(a −bL) = a2 −b2
(5.31)
which is not positive-deﬁnite. In particular, C′ contains zero divisors, for
instance
(1 + L)(1 −L) = 1 −L2 = 0.
(5.32)
Furthermore
1
2(1 ± L)
2
= 1
2(1 ± L)
(5.33)
so that 1
2(1 ± L) act as orthogonal projection operators, dividing C′ into
two null subspaces.
Another curious property of C′ involves square roots. How many split-
complex square roots of unity are there? Four! Not only do ±1 square to 1,
but so do ±L. More generally, from
(a + bL)2 = (a2 + b2) + 2abL
(5.34)

Other Number Systems
27
and
(a2 + b2) ± 2ab = (a ± b)2 ≥0
(5.35)
we see that a split complex number can only be the square of another split
complex number if its real part is at least as large as its imaginary part. In
particular, L itself cannot be the square of any split complex number!
You may recognize the inner product (5.31) as that of special relativ-
ity in two dimensions, with the spacetime vector (x, t) in 2-dimensional
Minkowski space corresponding to the split complex number x + tL. The
hyperbolic nature of the geometry of special relativity [3] yields
eLβ = cosh(β) + L sinh(β)
(5.36)
which can also be checked by expanding exp(Lβ) as a power series. For this
reason, the split complex numbers are also called hyperbolic numbers. Hy-
perbolic numbers not only represent the points in 2-dimensional Minkowski
space, but can also be used to describe the Lorentz transformations between
reference frames, which are nothing more than hyperbolic rotations.
5.5
Split Quaternions
We can repeat this process to obtain the split quaternions, denoted H′, as
H′ = C ⊕CL.
(5.37)
In order to keep track of these diﬀerent algebras, we will use K rather than i
for the imaginary unit here. Thus, H′ consists of linear combinations of
1, K, L, and KL, and it remains to work out the full multiplication table.
We have
K2 = −1,
L2 = +1,
(5.38)
(K)(L) = KL = −(L)(K),
(5.39)
(KL)2 = KLKL = −KKLL = +1,
(5.40)
K(KL) = −L = −(KL)K,
(5.41)
(KL)L = K = −L(KL).
(5.42)
The split quaternions are associative, but not commutative.
A typical element Q ∈H′ thus takes the form
Q = Q1 + Q2K + Q3KL + Q4L
(5.43)
and has (squared) norm
|Q|2 = QQ = Q2
1 + Q2
2 −Q2
3 −Q2
4
(5.44)

which has signature (2, 2), that is, two of our basis elements have (squared)
norm +1, namely 1 and K, and two have (squared) norm −1, namely KL
and L.
The split quaternions can also be obtained as
H′ = C′ ⊕C′K
(5.45)
so there are only two 4-dimensional composition algebras over the reals,
namely H and H′, not three. That is, it doesn’t matter whether the Cayley–
Dickson process is done ﬁrst with ϵ = +1, then with ϵ = −1, or vice versa.
Note, however, that the split quaternions H′ contain both the split complex
numbers C′ and the ordinary complex numbers C.
5.6
Split Octonions
If we repeat this process one more time, we obtain the split octonions,
denoted O′, as
O′ = H ⊕HL
(5.46)
where we now use I, J, K for the imaginary units in H. Thus, O′ consists
of linear combinations of {1, I, J, K, KL, JL, IL, L}, and it again remains
to work out the full multiplication table; the result is shown in Table 5.1.
The split octonions are not associative, but they are alternative.
It is easily checked that the inner product on O′ has signature (4, 4);
our conventions are such that basis elements containing L have (squared)
norm −1, and all others have (squared) norm +1.
The split octonions can also be obtained as
O′ = H′ ⊕H′J
(5.47)
so there are again only two 8-dimensional composition algebras over the
reals, namely O and O′. As before, the split octonions O′ contain both the
split quaternions H′ and the ordinary quaternions H.

Other Number Systems
29
5.7
Subalgebras of the Split Octonions
Unlike the (ordinary) octonions, the split octonions have subalgebras that
are not themselves composition algebras.
The composition property it-
self doesn’t fail; if it holds in the full algebra, it holds in all subalgebras.
Rather, it is the requirement that the norm be nondegenerate that fails;
these subalgebras are all null (to various degrees).
We have already seen that
1
2(1 ± L) are projection operators in C′.
This means that the subalgebra ⟨1 + L⟩(consisting of all real multiples of
1+L) closes under multiplication, and is therefore a subalgebra of C′ ⊂O′.
This subalgebra is isomorphic to the real numbers, since 1
2(1+L) acts as an
identity element, but is not isometric to the real numbers, since |1+L| = 0.
All elements of this subalgebra are null, that is, have norm zero.
Other null elements of O′ also generate 1-dimensional null subalgebras,
such as ⟨I+IL⟩. In this case, not only is |I+IL| = 0, but also (I+IL)2 = 0;
all products in this subalgebra are zero.
We can combine such null subalgebras in various ways.
The
2-dimensional subalgebra ⟨I + IL, J −JL⟩again has all products zero,
whereas the 2-dimensional subalgebra ⟨1 + L, I + IL⟩does not. This latter
algebra has the peculiar property that there are elements whose product is
zero in one order, but not the other, since
(1 + L)(I + IL) = 0,
(5.48)
(I + IL)(1 + L) = 2(I + IL).
(5.49)
Similarly, there are 3-dimensional null subalgebras ⟨I+IL, J +JL, K−KL⟩
and ⟨1 + L, I + IL, J −JL⟩, as well as a 4-dimensional null subalgebra
⟨1 + L, I + IL, J + JL, K −KL⟩.
Each of the subalgebras above is totally null; every element has norm
zero. There are also subalgebras of O′ that are only partially null; each
such subalgebra contains the identity element 1.
The best-known of these subalgebras are the 3-dimensional ternions,
generated by {1, L, I + IL}, and the 6-dimensional sextonions, generated
by {1, I, IL, L, J + JL, K −KL}; there is also a 4-dimensional subalgebra
generated by {1, L, I + IL, K −KL}.

Some Orthogonal Groups
6.1
Rotations
Rotations in two dimensions are easily described; just specify the angle
of rotation and the orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise). In three
dimensions, it is also necessary to specify the axis of rotation. By con-
vention, a positive angle of rotation about that axis implies rotation in a
counterclockwise direction looking back along the axis. Thus, a rotation
by π
2 about the North Pole corresponds to spinning the globe 1
4 of the way
around to the east; spinning to the west would correspond to a negative
rotation about the North Pole, or equivalently to a positive rotation about
the South Pole.
How do you specify a rotation in higher dimensions? In three dimen-
sions, specifying the axis of rotation is just a way of specifying the plane in
which the rotation takes place. In higher dimensions, one must specify the
plane of rotation itself, as there is more than one “axis” perpendicular to
any plane.
A key property of rotations is that they preserve length! Rotations take
a sphere to itself, and hence take any vector to some other vector of the same
length. In other words, the norm |⃗v| of a vector is unchanged by a rotation.
However, rotations are not the only transformations with this property;
there are also reﬂections. The diﬀerence is that rotations are orientation-
preserving, whereas reﬂections are orientation-reversing.
(These are the
only possibilities; any linear transformation must result in either an even
or an odd permutation of the relative positions of the axes.)
So in higher dimensions, we deﬁne a rotation to be a length-preserving,
orientation-preserving linear transformation of a real vector space. If you
preserve length and orientation, and then do so again, you have clearly
33

34
The Geometry of the Octonions
preserved length and orientation, so the composition of two rotations is
again a rotation. Furthermore, you can undo any (sequence of) rotation(s)
simply by performing the same rotation(s) in the opposite direction (and
in the opposite order). These two properties—closure under composition
and the existence of an inverse—ensure that the collection of all rotations
is a group.1
The group of length-preserving linear transformations in n dimensions
is called O(n), the orthogonal group in n dimensions; those transforma-
tions which are also orientation-preserving make up the rotation group in
n dimensions, SO(n).
These groups are normally expressed in terms of matrices. Since we
are studying transformations of Rn, these matrices are real, so that matrix
multiplication is associative. Consider ﬁrst linear transformations in two
dimensions, which take a vector
v =
x
y

(6.1)
to another vector
w = Mv
(6.2)
where M is some matrix
M =
a b
c d

(6.3)
with a, b, c, d, x, y ∈R. The (squared) length of v is given by
|v|2 = x2 + y2 = vT v
(6.4)
where vT denotes the matrix transpose of v. Thus, the orthogonal group
O(2) consists of those matrices M that preserve the length of v, that is, for
which
vT v = (Mv)T (Mv) = vTM T Mv
(6.5)
for any v ∈R2. This can only be true if
M TM = I
(6.6)
where I is the (2 × 2) identity matrix. Since
det(M T) = det(M)
(6.7)
1The group operation must also be associative. But composition of transformations is
associative by deﬁnition.

Some Orthogonal Groups
35
we must have
det M = ±1
(6.8)
and it is straightforward to generalize this construction to higher dimen-
sions. The rotation groups can therefore be expressed as
O(n) = {M ∈Rn×n : M T M = I},
(6.9)
SO(n) = {M ∈Rn×n : M T M = I, det M = 1},
(6.10)
where we have introduced the notation Km×n for the m×n matrices whose
elements lie in K; these expressions are often taken as the deﬁnitions of the
orthogonal and special orthogonal groups, respectively.
In the remainder of this chapter, we set the stage for later developments
by discussing the properties of several important orthogonal groups. In cer-
tain dimensions, orthogonal transformations can also be expressed in terms
of division algebras other than R; we save that discussion for Sections 7.2
and 9.1.
6.2
The Geometry of SO(2)
From the deﬁnition in the previous section, we have
SO(2) = {M ∈R2×2 : M TM = I, det M = 1}.
(6.11)
It is easy to show that the most general element of SO(2) takes the form
M =
cos α −sin α
sin α
cos α

(6.12)
representing a counterclockwise rotation by α in the xy plane. It is in fact
enough to check this claim on a basis, such as
ı =
1
0

,
(6.13)
=
0
1

,
(6.14)
noting that
Mı =
cos α
sin α

,
(6.15)
M =
−sin α
cos α

,
(6.16)
which indeed correspond to a counterclockwise rotation of the x and y axes
through an angle α, resulting in the rotated basis {Mı, M }—which are
just the columns of M.

36
The Geometry of the Octonions
6.3
The Geometry of SO(3)
In three dimensions, every rotation is in fact a rotation about some single
axis. To specify a rotation in three dimensions, it is therefore necessary to
specify this axis, and the angle about this axis through which to rotate.
It takes two parameters, such as latitude and longitude, to determine the
location of the axis, and a third to give the angle of rotation. These three
parameters are collectively known as Euler angles.
Another way to describe rotations in three dimensions is to explicitly
construct rotations (only) in the coordinate planes, and then argue that
any rotation can be obtained by suitably combining these rotations. In
particular, it is well-known that any rotation matrix in three dimensions
can be written (in several ways) as the product of three such rotations
in coordinate planes; this is in fact one way to construct the Euler angle
representation to begin with.
Since a description in terms of generalized Euler angles is not available
in higher dimensions, we focus instead on the alternative description in
terms of rotations in coordinate planes.
Rotation matrices of the form (6.12) generalize in an obvious way to
higher dimensions: Just make the matrix bigger, and add 1 and 0 ap-
propriately in the remaining entries. This construction leads to the three
matrices
Rx = Rx(α) =


1
0
0
0 cos α −sin α
0 sin α
cos α

,
(6.17)
Ry = Ry(α) =


sin α 0
cos α
0
1
0
cos α 0 −sin α

,
(6.18)
Rz = Rz(α) =


cos α −sin α 0
sin α
cos α
0
0
0
1

,
(6.19)
corresponding to rotations in the yz, zx, and xy planes, respectively.
Thus, the orthogonal group in three dimensions is deﬁned by
SO(3) = {M ∈R3×3 : M T M = I, det M = 1}
(6.20)
but is generated by the matrices Rx, Ry, Rz. We write this relationship as
either of
SO(3) = ⟨{Rx, Ry, Rz}⟩= ⟨Rx, Ry, Rz⟩
(6.21)

Some Orthogonal Groups
37
where care must be taken to avoid confusing this language with the similar
notation used to denote the span of certain vectors in a vector space. We
interpret (6.21) as meaning that any matrix in SO(3) can be written as the
product of matrices of the form Rx, Ry, Rz; there is no restriction on how
many matrices might be needed, nor on what parameter values (rotation
angles) are allowed.
6.4
The Geometry of SO(4)
In higher dimensions, not every rotation corresponds to a single axis to-
gether with an angle of rotation about this axis; the concept of Euler angles
does not generalize. The ﬁrst problem is that, even for rotations in a given
plane, it is not possible to associate an “axis” with a given rotation, as there
are multiple directions orthogonal to the plane of rotation. Furthermore, it
is no longer the case that every rotation corresponds to rotation in a single
plane.
We ﬁrst encounter this diﬃculty in four dimensions, where we can rotate
each of two independent planes arbitrarily. For this reason, we make no
eﬀort to identify all matrices satisfying the deﬁnition
SO(4) = {M ∈R4×4 : M T M = I, det M = 1}
(6.22)
but rather rely on the fact that any such rotation can be generated by
rotations in coordinate planes. How many such planes are there? In n
dimensions, there are
n
2

possible planes, so the dimension of the orthogonal
groups is given by
|SO(n)| = 1
2n(n −1).
(6.23)
In four dimensions, there are
4
2

= 6 possible planes; there are six matri-
ces of the same general form as our Rx, Ry, Rz from SO(3). In SO(3),
however, we labeled our generators by the axis about which they rotate; in
higher dimensions, we must instead label them by the plane in which they
rotate. So start by relabeling our generators of SO(3) as Ryz, Rzx, Ryz,
and reinterpret them as transformations in four dimensions that hold the
fourth axis, w say, ﬁxed. Then the three remaining generators of SO(4) are
Rwx, Rwy, Rwz, and we have
SO(4) = ⟨Ryz, Rzx, Ryz, Rwx, Rwy, Rwz⟩
(6.24)
Each of these generators of SO(4) corresponds to a rotation in a single
plane, leaving the orthogonal plane invariant.
We can instead consider

38
The Geometry of the Octonions
rotations that rotate two orthogonal planes. Although the angles of rotation
in the two planes could be diﬀerent, we consider the special case where these
angles are equal in magnitude. Such rotations are called isoclinic. Consider
therefore the transformations
S±
yz = S±
yz(α) = Ryz(α)Rwx(±α),
(6.25)
S±
zx = S±
zx(α) = Rzx(α)Rwy(±α),
(6.26)
S±
xy = S±
xy(α) = Rxy(α)Rwz(±α),
(6.27)
and the subsets
SO4± = ⟨S±
yz, S±
zx, S±
xy⟩
(6.28)
of SO(4). Remarkably, each of these subsets closes under multiplication;
SO4± are subgroups of SO(4). It is not hard to see that the multiplication
table for the generators of SO4± is identical to that of SO(3); we say that
SO4± ∼= SO(3)
(6.29)
(“each of SO4± is isomorphic to SO(3)”). Furthermore, we can recover
all of SO(4) by multiplying elements of these two subgroups together. For
instance,
S+
xy(α)S−
xy(α) = Rxy(2α),
(6.30)
S+
xy(α)S−
xy(−α) = Rwx(2α),
(6.31)
and we have shown that
SO(3) × SO(3) = SO(4)
(6.32)
a result that we will revisit in quaternionic language in Section 9.1.2.
6.5
Lorentz Transformations
There is another kind of “rotation”, namely the Lorentz transformations of
special relativity that relate inertial reference frames. Geometrically, such
transformations preserve a generalized distance, the (squared) “interval”
between spacetime events.
So in two dimensions, consider the vector
v =
t
x

(6.33)

Some Orthogonal Groups
39
which represents a spacetime event occurring at time t and position x.2
The (squared) magnitude of v is deﬁned by
|v|2 = x2 −t2
(6.34)
and represents the (squared) spacetime interval between the point (t, x)
and the origin. We can rewrite (6.34) in matrix language by introducing
the metric g, which here takes the form
g =
−1 0
0
1

(6.35)
leading to
|v|2 = vT gv.
(6.36)
The signature of an invertible diagonal matrix such as g is the number of
positive and negative entries; the signature of the identity matrix I (in two
dimensions) is (2, 0), and the signature of g is (1, 1).
As with ordinary rotations, we can now seek those linear transformations
that preserve the magnitude of v, that is, for which
vT v = (Mv)T g(Mv) = vTM T gMv
(6.37)
for any v ∈R2, which can only be true if
M T gM = g.
(6.38)
As with ordinary rotations, we must have det M = ±1; we will consider
only the case where det M = +1. We can therefore deﬁne the generalized
rotation groups SO(p, q) by
SO(p, q) = {M ∈Rn×n : M T gM = g, det M = 1}
(6.39)
where g now has signature (p, q). If q = 0 (or p = 0), we recover the ordinary
rotation groups; if q = 1, corresponding to a single “timelike” direction, we
obtain the Lorentz group in p + 1 dimensions. One often writes Rp,q for
the vector space with metric g of signature (p, q), and Mp+1 = Rp,1 for
Minkowski space in p + 1 dimensions, the arena for special relativity.
The geometry of 2-dimensional Minkowski space is particularly inter-
esting, and is discussed in more detail in [3]. From the deﬁnition above, we
have
SO(1, 1) = {M ∈R2×2 : M T gM = g, det M = 1}.
(6.40)
2We adopt units in which the speed of light c = 1, eﬀectively replacing t by ct, and
thus measuring time in units of length, such as centimeters.

40
The Geometry of the Octonions
It is easy to show that the most general element of SO(1, 1) takes the form
M =
cosh α sinh α
sinh α cosh α

(6.41)
representing a boost in the x direction, that is, a Lorentz transformation
from the laboratory reference frame, at rest, to a reference frame moving
to the right with speed tanh α.
6.6
The Geometry of SO(3, 1)
The world around us appears to have three independent directions, namely
East/West, North/South, and up/down. Special relativity tells us to in-
clude time; now we have a fourth “direction”, namely toward the future or
past.
It is customary to label these directions with time ﬁrst, so introduce
coordinates {t, x, y, z}. A spacetime vector is therefore a vector with four
components, such as
v =




t
x
y
z




(6.42)
which is also called a 4-vector.
The inner product on 4-dimensional Minkowski space, the arena for
special relativity, is given by (6.36), where now
g =




−1 0 0 0
0
1 0 0
0
0 1 0
0
0 0 1




(6.43)
so that
|v|2 = vT gv = −t2 + x2 + y2 + z2
(6.44)
which is also called the squared interval between the event (t, x, y, z) and

The Lorentz group in 3 + 1 spacetime dimensions is given by
SO(3, 1) = {M ∈R4×4 : M T gM = g, det M = 1}.

As with SO(4), it is suﬃcient to give generators for SO(3, 1), namely gen-
eralized rotations in the

we have the rotations

corresponding to rotations in the yz, zx, and xy planes, respectively. But
we also have the Lorentz transformations given by

corresponding to hyperbolic rotations in the tx, ty, and tz planes, respec-
tively, which are also called boosts in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.
Any element of the Lorentz group can be obtained as a product of these
six generators (with suitable parameters).3
3These six transformations actually generate the restricted Lorentz group, as we have
excluded transformations that reverse both the time direction and the spatial orientation.

42
The Geometry of the Octonions
As was the case in SO(4), not every element of SO(3, 1) corresponds to
a rotation or boost in a single plane. But there are also elements of SO(3, 1)
that do not correspond to rotations or boosts in any plane.
Both the rotation Rxy and the boosts Rtx and Rty leave the z direction
ﬁxed; this rotation also ﬁxes a timelike direction (t), whereas these boosts
also ﬁx a spacelike direction (y and x, respectively).
But consider the
matrix
N = N(α) =




(6.52)
which also ﬁxes the z direction. What else does this transformation leave
ﬁxed? Direct computation shows that N ﬁxes the null direction y = t; N
is a null rotation.
6.7
The Geometry of SO(4, 2)
The Lorentz group preserves “lengths”, that is, it preserves the squared
interval. We can ask instead what transformations preserve “angles”.
In Euclidean space, we can deﬁne angles in terms of the dot product,
that is, the angle θ between two vectors ⃗v and ⃗w is given by
cos θ = ⃗v · ⃗w
|⃗v| |⃗w|.
(6.53)
Any transformation that preserves length will preserve angles. But if we
rescale ⃗v and ⃗w, the angle between them still doesn’t change.
This formula for the angle between two vectors relies on the Euclidean
signature, but we can use the notion of scale-invariance to generalize the
notion of “angle-preserving” transformations. A conformal transformation
is one which preserves the inner product up to scale. Clearly, all orthogonal
transformations are also conformal transformations. And if we multiply all
vectors by an arbitrary factor, that is if we “stretch” or “dilate” our space
by a given amount, then we have simply multiplied all inner products by a
corresponding factor. That is,
(λv)T (λw) = λ2(vT w)
(6.54)
The transformation v −→λv is called a dilation; dilations are another type
of conformal transformations.

Some Orthogonal Groups
43
Conformal transformations should be thought of as acting on the end-
points of two vectors. If we shift every point in space by the same amount
in a given direction, inner products don’t change at all; translations are
also conformal transformations.
There is one additional type of conformal transformation, known as a
conformal translation. Let v ∈V be non-null, so that |v| ̸= 0. We can then
deﬁne the inverse of v via
v−1 =
v
|v|2
(6.55)
since the inner product of v with v−1 is 1. Taking the inverse of a vector
“inverts” it through the unit circle, and we use this to deﬁne a conformal
translation by a constant vector a to be the transformation
v −→

v−1 + α
−1 =
v + α|v|2
1 + 2⟨v, α⟩+ |α|2|v|2 .
(6.56)
If you see a resemblance between this transformation and the null transla-
tions in the previous section, that’s not a coincidence.
Conformal translations are clearly not linear. Nonetheless, conformal
transformations can be identiﬁed with orthogonal transformations.
We
consider here only the conformal group of Minkowski space, that is, we
start with SO(3, 1) and obtain SO(4, 2), but a similar construction can be
used in other cases.
Consider the vector
V =









T
X
Y
Z
P
Q









(6.57)
and deﬁne
v =




t
x
y
z



=
1
P + Q




T
X
Y
Z



.
(6.58)
Then we claim that SO(4, 2) acting as usual on V induces conformal trans-
formations acting on v.
We assume that T and Q are the timelike coordinates, that is, that
|V |2 = −T 2 + X2 + Y 2 + Z2 + P 2 −Q2
(6.59)

44
The Geometry of the Octonions
and we further assume that V (but not v!) is null, that is, that
|V |2 = 0.
(6.60)
Then SO(3, 1) ⊂SO(4, 2) acts as usual on all of T , X, Y , Z, but leaves
P and Q alone. This means that SO(3, 1) acts as usual on v, since the
factor P + Q goes along for the ride. Thus, Lorentz transformations on v
are contained in SO(4, 2).
Consider now the boost RP Q ∈SO(4, 2), which leaves T , X, Y , and Z
alone, but takes P + Q to
(P cosh α + Q sinh α) + (Q cosh α + P sinh α) = (P + Q) eα.
(6.61)
Thus, P + Q goes to a multiple of itself, and therefore so does v; this is the
dilation on v.
We have accounted for seven of the
6
2

= 15 elements of SO(4, 2);
the eight remaining transformations are best understood in terms of null
rotations. Consider for example
R± =




1 + α2/2









.
(6.62)
Direct computation shows that R+ induces a translation, and R−a con-
formal translation, both in the x direction; similar constructions yield the
remaining translations and conformal translations.
We have shown that SO(4, 2), the orthogonal group acting on V , is
also the conformal group when acting on v, that is, the conformal group of
(3 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space is precisely SO(4, 2).

Chapter 7
Some Unitary Groups
7.1
Unitary Transformations
Unitary transformations are analogous to rotations, but over the complex
numbers, rather than the reals.
We start again in two dimensions. Let v be a complex vector
v =
w
z

(7.1)
that is, a vector with complex components w, z ∈C; we write this as v ∈C2.
The squared length of v is given by
|v|2 = |w|2 + |z|2 = ww + zz = v†v
(7.2)
where v† denotes the Hermitian conjugate of v, deﬁned by
v† =

w z

(7.3)
or in other words the complex conjugate of the transpose of v. The unitary
group U(2) consists of those complex matrices M that preserve the length
of v, that is, for which
v†v = (Mv)†(Mv) = v†M †Mv
(7.4)
for any v ∈C2, which can only be true if
M †M = I.
(7.5)
Since
det(M†) = det(M)
(7.6)
we must have
| det M| = 1
(7.7)
45

46
The Geometry of the Octonions
and it is straightforward to generalize this construction to higher dimen-
sions. The unitary groups can therefore be expressed as
U(n) = {M ∈Cn×n : M †M = I},
(7.8)
SU(n) = {M ∈Cn×n : M †M = I, det M = 1},
(7.9)
which are often taken as the deﬁnitions of the unitary and special unitary
groups, respectively. The dimension of the unitary groups is given by
|SU(n)| = n2 −1.
(7.10)
In the remainder of this chapter, we set the stage for later developments
by discussing the properties of several important unitary groups. In cer-
tain dimensions, unitary transformations can also be expressed in terms of
division algebras other than C; we save that discussion for Section 9.2.
7.2
The Geometry of U(1)
We saw in Section 2.4 that complex multiplication can be interpreted ge-
ometrically as a rescaling and a rotation. A pure rotation is therefore ob-
tained by multiplying by a unit complex number. In other words, if |w| = 1,
then |wz| = |z|, that is, the length of z is preserved under multiplication
by w. What do unit-normed elements w ∈C look like? Since |reiθ| = r,
we have
w = eiθ
(7.11)
for some θ. Thus,
U(1) = {w ∈C : ww = 1} = {eiθ : θ ∈[0, 2π)}
(7.12)
which can also be written as
U(1) = {w ∈C : |w| = 1}.
(7.13)
Equivalently, we can describe U(1) as the group of transformations
U(1) = {z −→wz : w, z ∈C, |w| = 1}.
(7.14)
As already noted, a special case occurs when θ = π
2 , in which case w = i.
But we already have a name for the rotations in the plane, namely
SO(2), which we studied in Section 6.2. Thus, SO(2) and U(1) are the
same group, which we write as
U(1) ∼= SO(2)
(7.15)

Some Unitary Groups
47
where the symbol “∼=” is read as “is isomorphic to”. This isomorphism is
just the ﬁrst of several we will encounter relating diﬀerent descriptions of
the same group.
What about reﬂections?
A reﬂection about the y-axis is easy; that’s just complex conjugation,
namely the map
z −→z.
(7.16)
A reﬂection about any other line through the origin can be obtained by a
combination of rotations and conjugation. For instance, reﬂection about
the line y = x is given by
z −→eiθ/4(e−iθ/4z) = iz
(7.17)
and reﬂection about the x-axis is given by
z −→i(−iz) = −z.
(7.18)
7.3
The Geometry of SU(2)
The unitary group in two complex dimensions is deﬁned by
SU(2) = {M ∈C2×2 : M †M = I, det M = 1}.
(7.19)
A 2 × 2 matrix has four complex components, the constraint M †M = I
imposes four real conditions, and the determinant restriction adds just one
more (since the other conditions already imply that | det M| = 1). Thus,
we expect there to be three independent “rotations” in SU(2). A set of
generators is given by
Rx = Rx(α) =
 cos

(7.25)
σz =

(7.26)
The Pauli matrices have some important properties: They are Hermitian
(σ†
m = σ), tracefree (tr σm = 0), they each square to the identity matrix
(σ2
m = I), and they each have determinant −1 (det σm = −1). We will
have more to say about the Pauli matrices later.
How are we to interpret such complex transformations?
A complex vector v ∈C2 can also be viewed as an element of R4, by
treating the real and imaginary parts of the components of v as independent.
So consider
v =
a
b

=
a1 + a2i
b1 + b2i

(7.27)
with a1, a2, b1, b2 ∈R. The matrix
X = vv† =
|a|2
ab
ba
|b|2

(7.28)
has vanishing determinant, since
det X = |a|2|b|2 −|ab|2 = 0.
(7.29)
If we further assume that v is normalized, that is, that
v†v = |a|2 + |b|2 = 1
(7.30)
then we can write
X =
 1
2 + z x −iy
x + iy
1
2 −z

(7.31)
where
x + iy = (a1b1 + a2b2) + (a1b2 −a2b1)i,
(7.32)
z = 1
2(|a|2 −|b|2).
(7.33)
Since det M = 1 for M ∈SU(2), the transformation
X −→MXM †
(7.34)

Some Unitary Groups
49
preserves the determinant of X, which is now
det X = 0 = 1
4 −(x2 + y2 + z2).
(7.35)
But the transformation (7.34) also preserves the trace of X, since
tr X = tr (vv†) = v†v = |v|2
(7.36)
and M ∈SU(2). Such transformations must therefore preserve x2 +y2+z2.
Thus, elements of SU(2), acting on R3 via (7.34), induce transformations
in SO(3). Since −M induces the same SO(3) transformation as +M, we
cannot quite conclude that SU(2) ∼= SO(3). We say instead that SU(2) is
the double cover of SO(3). Since the double cover of SO(3) is called Spin(3),
we can write this relationship as
SU(2) ∼= Spin(3).
(7.37)
Under this correspondence, Rx ∈SU(2) does indeed correspond to a coun-
terclockwise rotation by α in the xy plane, and similarly for Ry and Rz,
which is why we used the same names as we did for SO(3), and why we
introduced the factor of two in (7.22).
7.4
The Geometry of SU(3)
The unitary group in three complex dimensions is deﬁned by
SU(3) = {M ∈C3×3 : M †M = I, det M = 1}.
(7.38)
A (complex) 3 × 3 matrix has nine complex components, the constraint
M †M = I imposes nine real conditions, and the determinant restric-
tion adds just one more (since the other conditions already imply that
| det M| = 1). Thus, we expect there to be eight independent “rotations”

The Gell-Mann matrices are again Hermitian (σ†
m = σ) and tracefree
(tr σm = 0), but do not share the other properties we listed for the Pauli
matrices in the previous section.
The group SU(3) is the smallest of the unitary groups to be unrelated
to the orthogonal groups; it’s something new.
1Our deﬁnition of λ5 diﬀers by an overall minus sign from the standard deﬁnition, in
order to correct a minor but annoying lack of cyclic symmetry in the original deﬁnition.

52
The Geometry of the Octonions
7.5
The Geometry of SU(2, 2)
Just as with the orthogonal groups, we can have unitary groups that pre-
serve an inner product with arbitrary signature. As before, we let g be the
diagonal matrix with signature (p, q), and deﬁne
SU(p, q) = {M ∈C(p+q)×(p+q) : M †gM = g, det M = 1}.
(7.56)
If q = 0 (or p = 0), we recover the ordinary unitary groups. As a nontrivial
example, we consider
SU(2, 2) = {M ∈C4×4 : M †gM = g, det M = 1}
(7.57)
where g has signature (2, 2).
It is easy to see that SO(p, q) has precisely pq boosts out of 1
2(n −1)n
total elements, where p + q = n. A little more work shows that SU(p, q)
has 2pq boosts out of n2 −1 total elements, where again p + q = n. Are
there cases where these numbers agree (not necessarily for the same values
of p, q, and n)?
Two possibilities are
1
2(3 −1)2 = 3 = 22 −1,
(7.58)
1
2(6 −1)6 = 15 = 42 −1.
(7.59)
With no boosts, that is, with q = 0 in both cases, this leads to the identi-
ﬁcations
SU(2) ∼= Spin(3),
(7.60)
SU(4) ∼= Spin(6)
(7.61)
where we must again replace the orthogonal groups by their double covers,
the spin groups. We have already seen (7.60), but (7.61) is new. Taking
other signatures into account, we have the two further identiﬁcations
SU(1, 1) ∼= Spin(2, 1),
(7.62)
SU(2, 2) ∼= Spin(4, 2)
(7.63)
so that, locally at least, we can identify SU(2, 2) with SO(4, 2), which we
have already studied.
Knowing now that we can identify elements of SU(2, 2) with those of
SO(4, 2), we write down generators of SU(2, 2), using the appropriate names
from the generators of SO(4, 2).

Some Unitary Groups
53
We know that SO(4, 2) acts on vectors with six components, such as
v =







(7.65)
whose determinant is
det P = (−t2 + x2 + y2 + z2 + p2 −q2)2
(7.66)
which is precisely the (square of the) SO(4, 2) (squared) norm of v. Since
det(MPM T) = det P
(7.67)
so long as det M = ±1, elements M ∈SU(2, 2) will preserve the determi-
nant of P, and are therefore in O(4, 2); whether they are in SO(4, 2) depends
on whether they preserve orientation. Furthermore, P is the most general
4 × 4 antisymmetric complex matrix, and MPM T is automatically anti-
symmetric if P is. Thus, all we need to do to show that SU(2, 2) ⊂SO(4, 2)
is to exhibit 15 generators of SU(2, 2), and check that they preserve ori-
entations; this also suﬃces to demonstrate the (local) equivalence between
SU(2, 2) and SO(4, 2), since each has 15 generators.
One possible choice of such generators is given by

Some Symplectic Groups
8.1
Symplectic Transformations
Orthogonal and unitary transformations preserve symmetric inner prod-
ucts; symplectic transformations preserve an antisymmetric product. Let
Ωbe the 2m × 2m matrix with block structure
Ω=
 0
Im
−Im
0

(8.1)
where Im denotes the m × m identity matrix. Then the real symmetric
groups Sp(2m, R) are deﬁned by1
Sp(2m, R) = {M ∈R2m×2m : MΩM T = Ω}.
(8.2)
Although not obvious at the group level,2
MΩM T = Ω⇐⇒M T ΩM = Ω
(8.3)
so an equivalent deﬁnition is
Sp(2m, R) = {M ∈R2m×2m : M TΩM = Ω}.
(8.4)
1There are many diﬀerent, overlapping conventions for the names of the symplectic
groups. The group Sp(2m, R) is also written as Sp(m, R). Since iΩis a Hermitian inner
product of signature (m, m), Sp(2m, R) is a real subgroup of SU(m, m), and is also
written as Sp(m, m).
2This result is easy to see at the Lie algebra level, that is, by treating M as a 1-parameter
family of transformations connected to the identity, and diﬀerentiating with respect to
the parameter.
Denoting the derivative of M at the identity element by A, we have
AΩ+ ΩAT = 0 if M ∈Sp(2m, R). Multiplying on both sides by Ω, and using the fact
that Ω2 = −I results in ΩA + AT Ω= 0 and we have successfully moved the transposed
matrix from one side to the other.
57

58
The Geometry of the Octonions
Other real forms of the symplectic groups can be obtained by ﬁrst com-
plexifying Sp(2m, R), that is, by considering3
Sp(2m, R) ⊗C = {M ∈C2m×2m : M TΩM = Ω}.
(8.5)
Of particular interest is the compact real form, obtained as the intersection
of Sp(2m, R) ⊗C with SU(2m), that is, the groups
Sp(m) = {M ∈C2m×2m : M T ΩM = Ω, M †M = I}.
(8.6)
The dimension of the symplectic groups is given by
|Sp(m)| = m(2m + 1).
(8.7)
Real forms with diﬀerent signatures can be obtained by intersecting with
SU(p, q), where p + q = 2m, rather than with SU(2m).
8.2
The Geometry of Sp(4, R)
From Section 8.1, we have
Sp(4, R) = {M ∈R4×4 : MΩM T = Ω}
(8.8)
where
Ω=



.
(8.9)
Consider now the antisymmetric matrix
P =




−p −q

and note that
P TΩP = PΩP T = |P|2Ω
(8.11)
where
|P|2 = −t2 + x2 + z2 + p2 −q2
(8.12)
3Again, there are several conventions for the name of this group, and for the names of
its subgroups. However, we avoid the name Sp(2m, C), which we reserve for a diﬀerent
group.

Some Symplectic Groups

(and is also the square root of det P). We claim that M ∈Sp(4, R) acts on
P via
P −→M TPM
(8.13)
that is, we claim that M TPM is a matrix of the same form as P. What
form is that? P is clearly antisymmetric, and the transformation (8.13)
clearly takes antisymmetric matrices to antisymmetric matrices, since
(M TPM)T = M TP T M = −M TPM.
(8.14)
However, antisymmetric matrices in four (real) dimensions contain six in-
dependent components, and we only have ﬁve. Which degree of freedom
are we missing? That’s easy: P does not contain a multiple of Ωitself. But
that’s ﬁne, since (8.13) takes Ωto itself, so if there’s no Ω“component” to
start with, then there won’t be one afterward.
So what does the transformation (8.13) do? We have
(M T PM)Ω(M TPM)T = M TP(MΩM T)P TM
= M T(PΩP T )M = M T|P|2ΩM
= |P|2Ω
(8.15)
since |P|2 is a real number, and therefore commutes with M T . But |P|2
is just the norm on R5 with signature (3, 2), which is thus preserved by
Sp(4, R). Since both Sp(4, R) and SO(3, 2) are 10-dimensional, we have
shown that
Sp(4, R) ∼= Spin(3, 2)
(8.16)
where Spin(3, 2) is of course the double cover of SO(3, 2).
8.3
The Geometry of Sp(6, R)
It is instructive to compare the description of Sp(4, R) ∼= Spin(3, 2) given in
Section 8.2 with the description of SU(2, 2) ∼= Spin(4, 2) given in Section 7.5.
It is clear that Sp(4, R) is (can be identiﬁed with) a subgroup of SU(2, 2);
it turns out to be the “real part” of SU(2, 2). In other words, SU(2, 2)
turns out to deserve the name “Sp(4, C).” A similar construction shows
that Sp(6, R) can be interpreted as the real part of SU(3, 3), which in turn
deserves the name “Sp(6, C).”
As discussed in Section 9.4, this usage requires a choice of what one
means by “symplectic”, after which the identiﬁcations above are straightfor-
ward. It should however be emphasized that this correspondence between
unitary and symplectic groups fails over H and O.

60
The Geometry of the Octonions
Further insight into the structure of Sp(6, C) can be obtained by reading
Section 11.5, but replacing O everywhere by C.

Chapter 9
Symmetry Groups over Other
Division Algebras
9.1
Some Orthogonal Groups over Other Division Algebras
Each of the division algebras corresponds to a 2k-dimensional vector space,
with positive-deﬁnite inner product.
Multiplication by unit-normed ele-
ments preserves the norm, and thus induces either a rotation or a reﬂection
on the vector space. We therefore expect to be able to represent several
orthogonal groups in terms of division algebra multiplication. This expec-
tation is correct, but there are several cases, including some surprises due
to the lack of commutativity and associativity.
9.1.1
A Quaternionic Description of SO(3)
We saw in Section 7.2 how to generate SO(2) through multiplication by a
unit-normed complex number. We can try the same thing with the quater-
nions: Multiplication by a unit-normed quaternion should be a rotation.
Since the quaternions are 4-dimensional, we expect to get rotations in four
dimensions.
Not so fast!
We saw in Section 3.4 that quaternionic multiplication
corresponds to rotations in two planes, making it diﬃcult to count. Let’s
try to generate rotations in just one plane.
We start with the imaginary quaternions, which correspond to vectors
in three dimensions.
If we want to rotate only these three dimensions,
we need transformations that leave the real part of a quaternion alone.
Consider the map
q −→pqp−1
(9.1)
61

62
The Geometry of the Octonions
which is called conjugation of q by p.1
If [p, q] = 0, that is, if p and q
commute, then of course pqp−1 = q. In particular, conjugation preserves 1,
and hence all real numbers.
Conjugation automatically preserves the norm of q, since
|pqp−1| = |p| |q| |p|−1 = |q|.
(9.2)
This argument shows that the norm of p plays no role in the transformation,
so we can assume |p| = 1. So let p = eiα. Then p−1 = p, and conjugation
by p becomes
q −→pqp.
(9.3)
What does conjugation by p do to q? Since H = C ⊕Cj, we can write
q = r1eiθ + r2eiφj.
(9.4)
Remembering that i and j anticommute, we therefore have
pqp = eiα 
r1eiθ + r2eiφj

e−iα = r1eiθ + r2ei(φ+2α)j.
(9.5)
Thus, conjugation by eiα leaves both the real and i directions alone, but
induces a rotation by 2α in the jk plane. Similarly, conjugation by ejα
and ekα correspond to rotations by 2α in the ki and ij planes, respectively.
Since we can generate any rotation by combining rotations in the coordi-
nate planes, we see that conjugation by unit-normed quaternions generates
SO(3), the rotations in Im H.2
In three dimensions, we can actually do
better: any rotation in three dimensions is in fact a rotation about a single
axis, so we can dispense with the notion of “generators” in this case. In
other words,
SO(3) = {p ∈H : |p| = 1}
(9.6)
or, in the sense of transformations,
SO(3) = {q −→pqp : p, q ∈H, |p| = 1}.
(9.7)
A special case occurs when p = i, corresponding to a rotation by π in
the jk plane, which takes every element of the jk plane and multiplies it
by −1. We call such a transformation a ﬂip. Any imaginary unit u can be
used here, corresponding to a ﬂip in the plane perpendicular to it.
What about one-sided multiplication by unit-normed quaternions?
These transformations are in one-to-one correspondence with conjugation,
1Do not confuse the two diﬀerent uses of the word “conjugation”!
2As noted above, the restriction on the norm can be dropped, since it cancels out of
the transformation.

Symmetry Groups over Other Division Algebras
63
so there aren’t enough transformations to generate all of SO(4). In fact,
this must be another version of SO(3)—not the same version, since the
identity element is not left invariant. Let’s take a closer look.
Starting again from (9.4), we have
eiα 
r1eiθ + r2eiφj

= r1ei(θ+α) + r2ei(φ+α)j
(9.8)
so that left multiplication by eiα corresponds to a rotation by α in both
the 1i and jk planes. What about right multiplication? Now we have

r1eiθ + r2eiφj

eiα = r1ei(θ+α) + r2ei(φ−α)j
(9.9)
corresponding to a rotation by +α in the 1i plane, but a rotation by −α in
the jk plane.
We conclude that there are three diﬀerent versions of SO(3) here, in-
duced respectively by conjugation, left multiplication, and right multipli-
cation by a unit quaternion.
9.1.2
A Quaternionic Description of SO(4)
We return to the question of ﬁnding rotations in four dimensions. Conju-
gation doesn’t do the job—as we saw in Section 9.1.1, conjugation induces
rotations in three dimensions, and single-sided multiplication isn’t suﬃ-
cient to induce rotations in four dimensions.
Therein lies a clue; what
about double-sided multiplication?
We compute
eiα 
r1eiθ + r2eiφj

eiα = r1eiθ+2α + r2eiφj
(9.10)
corresponding to a rotation by 2θ in the 1i plane. Again, we can repeat
this construction with i replaced by j and k to produce rotations in the
1j and 1k planes, respectively. Combining these rotations with those in
the imaginary planes (ij, jk, and ki), we have constructed rotations in
each of the six coordinate planes, from which arbitrary rotations can be
constructed.
We have shown that every transformation in SO(4) is a combination of
transformations that take q either to pqp = pqp−1 or pqp. However, not
every SO(4) transformation is necessarily of this form, so we write
SO(4) = ⟨{q −→pqp : p, q ∈H, |p| = 1}
∪{q −→pqp : p, q ∈H, |p| = 1}⟩
(9.11)
where the angled brackets imply that SO(4) is generated by the given trans-
formations.

64
The Geometry of the Octonions
Thanks to the associativity of the quaternions, we can rewrite these
transformations in several ways. First of all, we can combine all of the
factors on the left into a single factor, and the same on the right. Thus,
SO(4) = ⟨{q −→p1qp2 : p1, p2, q ∈H, |p1| = 1 = |p2|}.
(9.12)
Furthermore, if we ﬁrst conjugate q by p, then multiply by p on both
sides, we could equivalently have multiplied by p2 on the left; a similar
construction yields multiplication on the right. Thus, instead of combin-
ing conjugation and two-sided multiplication, we could equivalently have
combined left and right multiplication, that is
SO(4) = ⟨{q −→pq : p ∈H, |p| = 1} ∪{q −→qp : p ∈H, |p| = 1}⟩. (9.13)
But we have already seen that single-sided multiplication generates a ver-
sion of SO(3). We have therefore established an equivalence between two
copies of SO(3) and SO(4), which is customarily written as
SO(4) ∼= SO(3) × SO(3).
(9.14)
9.1.3
An Octonionic Description of SO(7)
We showed in Section 9.1.1 that conjugation by a unit-normed imaginary
quaternion u yields a ﬂip of imaginary quaternions about the u-axis. Flips
cannot only be used with quaternions, but also with octonions, since the
expression pxp involves only two directions, and hence lies in a quaternionic
subalgebra of O; there are no associativity issues here.
But any rotation can be constructed from two ﬂips. For instance, to
rotate the xy-plane, ﬁrst pick any line (through the origin) in that plane.
Now rotate by π about that line, that is, take all points in the plane orthog-
onal to the given line by −1. For example, if the chosen line is the x-axis,
then the x-coordinate of a point is unaﬀected, while its y- and z-coordinates
are multiplied by −1. Now pick another line in the xy-plane, at an angle
α from the ﬁrst line, and repeat the process. Points along the z axis are
reﬂected twice, and are thus taken back to where they started. But any
point in the xy-plane winds up being rotated by 2α! (This is easiest to see
for points along the x-axis.)
It doesn’t matter which two lines in the xy-plane we choose, so long
as they are separated by α (with the correct orientation). And we have
described this procedure as though it were taking place in three dimensions,
but in fact it works in any number of dimensions; there can be any number
of “z-coordinates”, all of which are ﬂipped twice, and return to where they
started.

Symmetry Groups over Other Division Algebras
65
To rotate counterclockwise by an angle 2α in the ij-plane, we therefore
begin by conjugating with i, thus rotating about the i-axis. To complete
the ij rotation, we need to rotate about the line in the ij-plane which makes
an angle α with the i-axis. This is accomplished by conjugating by a unit
octonion u pointing along the line, which is easily seen to be
u = i cosα + j sin α.
(9.15)
Finally, note that the conjugate of any imaginary octonion is just minus
itself. Putting this all together, a rotation by 2α in the ij-plane is given by
x −→(i cosα + j sin α)(ixi)(i cos α + j sin α)
(9.16)
for any octonion x. (We have removed two minus signs.)
If x ∈H, we can collapse the parentheses in (9.16), obtaining
x −→(−cosα −k sin α)x(−cos α + k sin α) = ekαxe−kα
(9.17)
which is just conjugation by a unit quaternion, as in the construction
of SO(3) in Section 9.1.1. Over the octonions, however, we cannot sim-
plify (9.16) any further; it takes two transformations, not just one, to ro-
tate a single plane. We refer to this process as nesting, and describe the
transformation (9.16) as a nested ﬂip.
We can repeat this construction using any unit-normed imaginary units
u, v that are orthogonal to each other, obtaining the rotation in the
uv-plane. Since such rotations generate SO(7), we have
SO(7) = ⟨{x −→(u cos α + v sin α)(uxu)(u cos α + v sin α) :
u, v, x ∈O, u2 = −1 = v2, {u, v} = 0}⟩.
(9.18)
9.1.4
An Octonionic Description of SO(8)
The transition from SO(7) to SO(8) is much the same as from SO(3) to
SO(4): Flips generate SO(7), and two-sided multiplication generates the
rotations with the real direction. To see the latter property, consider the
transformation
x −→eℓαxeℓα.
(9.19)
We can separate x ∈O into a piece in the complex subalgebra containing ℓ,
and a piece orthogonal to this subalgebra. That is, since
O = C ⊕C⊥
(9.20)
we have
x = reℓθ + x⊥
(9.21)

66
The Geometry of the Octonions
where x⊥is orthogonal to ℓ. Recall that imaginary octonions are orthogonal
if they anticommute, that is
x ⊥y ⇐⇒{x, y} = xy + yx = 0
(9.22)
so long as Re (x) = 0 = Re (y), and that
euαy = ye−uα
(9.23)
if u ⊥y (and again both u and y are imaginary). Thus,
eℓαxeℓα = eℓα(reℓθ + x⊥)eℓα = reℓθ+2α + x⊥
(9.24)
where we have used (9.23).
Without further ado, we have
SO(8) = ⟨{x −→(u cos α + v sin α)(uxu)(u cos α + v sin α) :
u, v, x ∈O, u2 = −1 = v2, {u, v} = 0}⟩
∪{x −→pxp : p, x ∈O, |p| = 1}⟩.
(9.25)
However, both of these types of transformations are (generated by) symmet-
ric multiplication. Furthermore, unlike with the quaternions, single-sided
multiplication with the octonions actually generates all of SO(8), not merely
a subset of it. This is an important property of SO(8), known as triality,
which says that each of the following representations is equivalent:3
SO(8) = ⟨{x −→pxp : p, x ∈O, |p| = 1}⟩,
(9.26)
SO(8) = ⟨{x −→px : p, x ∈O, |p| = 1}⟩,
(9.27)
SO(8) = ⟨{x −→xp : p, x ∈O, |p| = 1}⟩.
(9.28)
This diﬀerence between SO(8) and SO(4) is due to nesting. Single-sided
multiplication generates SO(8); unlike over the quaternions, iterated mul-
tiplications do not collapse to a single operation over the octonions.
9.2
Some Unitary Groups over Other Division Algebras
In Section 7.3, the complex group SU(2) = SU(2, C) was represented in
terms of 2 × 2 matrices Rx, Ry, Rz, acting on complex matrices of the
3More formally, (9.26) yields the vector representation of SO(8), (9.27) yields the spinor
representation of SO(8), and (9.28) yields the dual spinor representation of SO(8), in
all cases acting on the 8-dimensional space O.
Triality is the implicit map between
these three representations given by relating the transformations determined by the
same element p.

X =

(9.29)
thus demonstrating the isomorphism SU(2) ∼= Spin(3), the double cover of
SO(3). Recall that (setting β = α
2 for convenience)
Ry =
cos β −sin β
sin β
cos β

(9.30)
is real, whereas Rx and Rz are complex. But Ry has precisely the form
of an element of SO(2), as discussed in Section 6.2. We therefore identify
SO(2) as a “real unitary” matrix, that is, we write
SU(2, R) ∼= SO(2).
(9.31)
Can we go in the other direction? Extending X is easy; just replace the
complex number by a division algebra element, so that now
X =
1 + z
a

(9.32)
with a ∈K.
It is important to realize that X is complex, in the sense that it involves
only one octonionic direction. In particular,
det X = 1 −|a|2 −z2.
(9.33)
Since tr X = 2 and does not involve z or a, any transformation that pre-
serves both the determinant and trace of X will also preserve the norm
|a|2 + z2. We therefore expect
SU(2, H) ∼= Spin(5),
(9.34)
SU(2, O) ∼= Spin(9),
(9.35)
where the Spin groups are of course the double covers of the corresponding
orthogonal groups. But which transformations are these?
Over H, this question is easy to answer. As in Section 7.3, consider
transformations of the form
X −→MXM †
(9.36)
and build M from Rx, Ry, and Rz, but allow i to be replaced by j or k in
Rx and Ry. As is easily checked by direct computation, each of these seven
4This is really 2X, with x, y, z rescaled for convenience.

68
The Geometry of the Octonions
transformations preserves the determinant and trace of X. But there are
5
2

= 10 independent generators of Spin(5). Which ones are we missing?
We’ve left out the transformations that mix up i, j, k. But we know from
Section 9.1.1 how to implement these transformations using conjugation.
Now, however, we must conjugate using multiples of the (2 × 2) identity
matrix I, such as the phase transformation
M = eiα = eiαI.
(9.37)
Since conjugation leaves real numbers alone, the diagonal of X is not af-
fected. These are our three missing generators, and we have indeed veri-
ﬁed (9.34).
The same procedure works over O as well, but we must be careful about
associativity. We now have seven versions of Rx and Rz, which together
with Ry yield 15 generators. Which generators are we missing? The 21
SO(7) transformations that mix up (only) the imaginary units. But there
are only seven phase transformations of the form (9.37)!
The resolution to this apparent quandary is to recall the discussion in
Section 9.1.3, where it was shown that two ﬂips must be nested in order
to generate rotations in just one plane; the same principle applies to phase
transformations. Thus, there are in fact
7
2

= 21 (nested!) phase transfor-
mations, just what we need to establish (9.35).
9.3
Some Lorentz Groups over Other Division Algebras
The construction in Section 9.2 can be extended to the corresponding
Lorentz groups, as was originally done by Sudbery [4].
We normally think of a vector in Minkowski spacetime in the form
x =




t
x
y
z



.
(9.38)
But there is another natural way to package these four degrees of freedom.
Consider the complex matrix
X =
 t + z
x −iy
x + iy
t −z

= t I + x σx + y σy + z σz.
(9.39)
This matrix is Hermitian, that is
X† = X
(9.40)

Symmetry Groups over Other Division Algebras
69
where the Hermitian conjugate of a matrix, denoted by a dagger, is the
matrix obtained by taking both the transpose and the (complex) conjugate
of the original matrix. Note that 2 × 2 complex Hermitian matrices have
precisely four (real) independent components; the diagonal elements must
be real, and the oﬀ-diagonal elements must be (complex) conjugates of each
other.
As discussed in Section 6.6, Lorentz transformations are transformations
which preserve the “squared length” of x,
|x|2 = x2 + y2 + z2 −t2
(9.41)
and these transformations form the Lorentz group, SO(3, 1).
How can we express such transformations in terms of the matrix X?
The beauty of this description lies in the fact that the norm of x is just
(minus) the determinant of X, that is
−det X = |x|2 = x2 + y2 + z2 −t2.
(9.42)
We therefore seek linear transformations which preserve the determinant.
At ﬁrst sight, this is easy. Since (complex) determinants satisfy
det(XY ) = (det X)(det Y )
(9.43)
it would seem that all we need to do is multiply X (on either side) by a
matrix with determinant 1. There are two problems with this approach.
First of all, there is no simple condition to ensure that the product XY
is Hermitian! Furthermore, this approach will fail over the other division
algebras; (9.43) is not true for quaternionic matrices.
We already know how to solve these problems. We consider conjugation
of X by a matrix M, that is, we consider the transformation
X −→MXM †.
(9.44)
Using the property
(XY )† = Y †X†
(9.45)
it is easy to check that MXM † is Hermitian if X is—with no such restric-
tion on M. We therefore seek complex matrices M such that
det(MXM †) = det(M) det(X) det(M †) = det X
(9.46)
or equivalently
det(MM †) = det(M) det(M †) = 1.
Since
det M † = det M
(9.47)

70
The Geometry of the Octonions
we must have
| det M| = 1.
(9.48)
However, over C, we can assume without loss of generality that det M = 1,
since we can always multiply M by a complex phase without aﬀecting
anything else. We have in fact shown that the group of complex matrices
with determinant 1, written as SL(2, C), is (locally) the same as the Lorentz
group. In fact,
SL(2, C) ∼= Spin(3, 1)
(9.49)
the double cover of SO(3, 1).
What do these transformations look like? What matrices M correspond
to spatial rotations? The spatial rotations can be built from the SU(2)
transformations Rx, Ry, and Rz, as discussed in Section 7.3. Because of
the importance of the Lorentz group, we repeat that construction here,
using slightly diﬀerent notation.
First of all, a rotation by 2θ in the xy-plane is given by
Rz =
e−iθ
0
0
eiθ

.
(9.50)
It is straightforward to check that if
X′ = RzXR†
z =
 t′ + z′
x′ −iy′
x′ + iy′
t′ −z′

(9.51)
then
t′ = t,
x′ = x cos 2θ −y sin 2θ,
y′ = x sin 2θ + y cos 2θ,
z′ = z,
(9.52)
which corresponds to a counterclockwise rotation by 2θ in the xy-plane as
claimed. Of course, (9.52) can be put in matrix form, as
x′ = Λx
(9.53)
from which the traditional representation of this Lorentz transformation as
a 4 × 4 matrix Λ can easily be determined. Similarly, rotations in the yz-
and zx-planes are given, respectively, by
Rx =

cos θ −i sin θ
−i sin θ
cos θ

,
Ry =
cos θ −sin θ
sin θ
cos θ

.
(9.54)

Symmetry Groups over Other Division Algebras
71
Any rotation can be built up out of these generators.
What about the other Lorentz transformations, namely the ones which
“rotate” the time axis? These transformations, called boosts, are at the
heart of special relativity; geometrically boosts are simply hyperbolic rota-
tions. A boost in the zt-plane takes the form
Bz =
eβ
0
0
e−β

.
(9.55)
It is straightforward to check that if
X′ = BzXB†
z
(9.56)
then
t′ = t cosh 2β + z sinh 2β,
x′ = x,
y′ = y,
z′ = t sinh 2β + z cosh 2β,
(9.57)
corresponding to a boost in the zt-plane by 2β, that is, to a relative speed of
c tanh 2β. Similarly, boosts in the xt- and yt-planes are given, respectively,
by
Bx =
cosh β sinh β
sinh β cosh β

,
By =
 cosh β
−i sinh β
i sinh β
cosh β

.
(9.58)
What happens over the other division algebras?
As in Section 9.2,
simply replace the complex number x + iy in X by a division algebra
element a, so that
X =
t + z
a
a
t −z

.
(9.59)
Since a has 1, 2, 4, or 8 components depending on whether a is in R, C, H,
or O, respectively, X corresponds to a vector in a spacetime with 3, 4, 6,
or 10 dimensions. As before, the determinant gives the Lorentzian norm
−det X = |a|2 + z2 −t2.
(9.60)
There is no problem deﬁning the determinant here, since even in the octo-
nionic case the components of X lie in a complex subalgebra of O.
We are therefore led to seek transformations of the form (9.44) which
preserve the determinant. Even over the quaternions, however, we immedi-
ately have a problem: As already noted, (9.43) is not true for quaternionic

72
The Geometry of the Octonions
matrices! Furthermore, it is not at all obvious how to deﬁne the determi-
nant in the ﬁrst place for non-Hermitian matrices.
Fortunately, there is another identity which comes to the rescue here.
det(MXM †) = det(M †M) det X
(9.61)
so we need to look for quaternionic matrices M satisfying
det(M †M) = 1.
(9.62)
The order doesn’t matter here, since
det(MM †) = det(M †M)
(9.63)
holds over H.
Over the octonions, the situation is even worse: Because of the lack of
associativity, (9.44) is not well-deﬁned—nor is it clear that the right-hand
side is Hermitian! We resolve this diﬃculty by restricting to those matrices
M for which MXM† is well-deﬁned for all Hermitian X. It turns out to
be suﬃcient to assume that the components of M lie in a complex subalge-
bra of O.5 For such matrices, the transformation (9.44) involves only two
independent directions, and is therefore quaternionic. In particular, (9.61)
will hold.
It appears to be straightforward to generalize the rotations and boosts
given above. Ry still rotates the real direction in a with z; Bz still yields
a boost in the z-direction; Bx still yields a boost in the x-direction. The
remaining transformations are nearly as easy. By yields a boost in the
i-direction, with obvious generalizations to the other spatial directions ob-
tained by replacing i by j, k, etc. Similarly, Rx and Rz yield rotations
in the plane deﬁned by either the real part of a or z, respectively, and the
i-direction—again generalizing to j, k, etc.
Counting up what we’ve got, we see that we have boosts in all directions,
as well as all rotations involving either z or the real part of a.
That’s
more than enough to generate all the Lorentz transformations except those
involving two imaginary directions in a. But we know how to do these!
In Section 9.1.1, we obtained a rotation in the jk-plane for single quater-
nions by conjugating with eiθ. That works here as well! Conjugating X by
the matrix
Ri =
eiθ
0
0
eiθ

= eiθI
(9.64)
5The only other possibility is for the columns of the imaginary part of M to be real
multiples of each other [5].

Symmetry Groups over Other Division Algebras
73
won’t touch the diagonal of X, but will precisely rotate a (and a !) by 2θ
in the jk-plane. Similarly, replacing i with j and k yields rotations in the
other imaginary planes. The phase freedom in the complex case has become
an essential ingredient in performing these “internal” rotations over H!
Over the octonions, we must be a bit more careful. As noted in Sec-
tions 9.1.3 and 9.2, conjugation by eiθ, and hence by Ri, rotates three
planes, not just one. But again, we know how to solve this problem: Use
ﬂips! For instance,
X −→(i cos θ + j sin θ)iXi(i cos θ + j sin θ)
(9.65)
is a rotation by an angle 2θ in the ij-plane. Yet again, we see that the lack
of associativity has come to the rescue; the ability to nest transformations
is crucial to this construction.
We have therefore obtained an explicit form for the generators of Lorentz
transformations in 3, 4, 6, and 10 dimensions. But we have actually shown
more, namely that
SL(2, R) ∼= Spin(2, 1),
(9.66)
SL(2, C) ∼= Spin(3, 1),
(9.67)
SL(2, H) ∼= Spin(5, 1),
(9.68)
SL(2, O) ∼= Spin(9, 1),
(9.69)
that is, SL(2, K) is the double cover of the Lorentz group SO(k + 1, 1),
where k = |K| = 1, 2, 4, 8.
However, the groups SL(2, H) and SL(2, O)
require some explanation. The notation “SL” normally means those ma-
trices with determinant 1, but the determinant of a quaternionic matrix
is not well-deﬁned. The generalization? To require precisely (9.62)! Over
the octonions, all we must do is to also add the restriction that (9.44) be
well-deﬁned.6
In what sense do the Lorentz groups as deﬁned here consist of “all ma-
trices of determinant 1”? In the complex case, multiplication of M by an
arbitrary phase eiθ does not change the action (9.44), so we can safely re-
strict to matrices with det M = 1. The quaternionic case is more subtle:
6Wait a minute, how can SL(2, O) be a group when O isn’t associative? Simple; the
multiplication in SL(2, O) is not matrix multiplication, but composition, that is
(M1 • M2)[X] = M1
ˆ
M2[X]
˜
= M1(M2XM†
2)M†
1
where we have used square brackets to denote the action of an element of the group
on a vector, and a bullet to indicate the group operation, which is associative. Similar
comments apply to other groups constructed over O, such as SU(2, O).

74
The Geometry of the Octonions
Multiplication by eiθ now corresponds to a rotation in the jk-plane, and
therefore must be included as a Lorentz transformation even though its de-
terminant is not real. However, we can rewrite such phase transformations
as a product of two ﬂips, each with determinant −1, and this construction
carries over unchanged to the octonionic case. Furthermore, it is straight-
forward to rewrite the remaining Lorentz generators, which are already
matrices with determinant +1, as the product of two matrices each with
determinant −1.
Thus, the Lorentz groups could be deﬁned for each of the division alge-
bras as being generated by those transformations consisting of two complex
matrices of determinant −1, which suitably generalizes the more traditional
deﬁnition in terms of matrices of determinant +1. It is only in this nested
sense that SL(2, O) consists of “all matrices of determinant +1.”
9.4
Some Symplectic Groups over Other Division Algebras
In Section 8.1 we showed that Sp(2) ∼= Spin(5), the double cover of SO(5),
and in Section 9.2 we showed that SU(2, H) ∼= Spin(5). Meanwhile, in Sec-
tion 8.2 we showed that Sp(4, R) ∼= Spin(3, 2), the double cover of SO(3, 2).
Is there a relationship between symplectic groups and the quaternions?
We ﬁrst ask under what conditions complex matrices can be reinter-
preted as m × m quaternionic matrices. It is easier to go the other way:
How do we turn a quaternionic matrix into a complex matrix?
Begin with the simplest case: How do we turn a quaternion into a
2 × 2 complex matrix? That’s easy: Use (±i times the) Pauli matrices to
represent the quaternionic units. Thus, the matrix representation of the
quaternion a + bi + cj + dk is given by
aI + b(iσz) −c(iσy) + d(iσx) =
a + bi −c + di
c + di
a −bi

.
(9.70)
This decomposition is just the Cayley–Dickson process in reverse!
What properties do such matrices have? It’s not hard to see that a
complex matrix M has the form given in (9.70) if and only if
M = −ΩMΩ
(9.71)
where M and Ωare now 2 × 2 matrices, that is, m = 1. In an appro-
priate basis, however, nothing changes; a 2m × 2m complex matrix that
satisﬁes (9.71) can be reinterpreted as an m × m quaternionic matrix.

Symmetry Groups over Other Division Algebras
75
If M is complex and satisﬁes both M TΩM = Ωand M = −ΩMΩ, then
M †M = M
TM = (−ΩMΩ)TM = −ΩM TΩM = −ΩΩ= I
(9.72)
and we have shown that
SU(m, H) ∼= Sp(m).
(9.73)
The case m = 1 is just
Sp(1) ∼= SU(1, H) ∼= Spin(3)
(9.74)
which is just the isometry group of the quaternions, and, as we have already
seen,
Sp(2) ∼= SU(2, H) ∼= Spin(5)
(9.75)
when m = 2.
A similar argument can be used to show that SU(p, q, H) is a symplectic
group, often written as Sp(p, q, R).7 Thus, some symplectic groups can be
reinterpreted as quaternionic unitary groups. What about Sp(2m, R)?
Consider Sp(4, H), which is the double cover of SO(3, 2). Thus, Sp(4, H)
has 3×2 = 6 boosts. But it is easy to show that SU(p, q, H) has 4pq boosts.
Thus, Sp(4, H) ̸∼= SU(p, q, H) for any p+q = 5. However, Sp(4, H) is referred
to as the “split” form of Sp(2), which suggests that we should use the split
form of the quaternions, namely H′.
So what is Sp(m, H′)? Again, we start with the case m = 1, and again
we use Pauli matrices. The split quaternion a + bL + cK + dKL can be
represented by
aσt + bσz −c(iσy) + dσx =
a + b −c + d
c + d
a −b

(9.76)
where we have written σt rather than I for the 2 × 2 identity matrix.
We want to repeat the computation in (9.72), but we must now carefully
distinguish between conjugation in H′ and conjugation in C.
Let’s start again. According to the Cayley–Dickson process discussed
in Section 5.1, we can combine a pair of complex numbers a, b ∈C into a
matrix
q =
 a −b
bϵ
a

(9.77)
7Yet again, there are several conventions for the names of these groups. In particular,
Sp(m, m, R) is not the same as Sp(m, m) as deﬁned implicitly in Section 8.1, nor is
Sp(2m, R) the same as Sp(m).

76
The Geometry of the Octonions
where ϵ = 1 if q ∈H, and ϵ = −1 if q ∈H′.
We can generalize this
construction to matrices, leading to the representation
Q =
 A
−B
Bϵ
A

(9.78)
of a (possibly split) quaternionic matrix in terms of complex matrices A
and B. As in the Cayley–Dickson process, the (quaternionic!) conjugate
of Q is obtained by replacing A with A, and B with −B, and the (quater-
nionic!) transpose of Q is obtained by replacing each of A and B with its
transpose. We therefore have
Q† =
 A†
BT
−B†ϵ AT

= −ΩM TΩ
(9.79)
which however only reduces to the complex Hermitian conjugate of Q
if ϵ = 1.
Using quaternionic conjugation throughout, the computation
in (9.72) now goes through unchanged whether the components of M are
in H or H′, and we have shown that
SU(m, H′) ∼= Sp(2m, R).
(9.80)
Thus, all of the (real forms of the) symplectic groups are indeed quater-
nionic, but possibly split.
We have just seen that the real symplectic groups are really the quater-
nionic generalization of the unitary groups.
But we can also construct
symplectic groups over other division algebras besides the reals.
The deﬁnition of symplectic groups given in Section 8.1 is normally
used verbatim to deﬁne symplectic groups over other division algebras.
However, we follow Sudbery [4] in using Hermitian conjugation, rather than
transpose, in the deﬁnition of generalized symplectic groups. That is, we
deﬁne
Sp(2m, K) = {M ∈K2m×2m : MΩM † = Ω}
(9.81)
for K = R, C, H, O. If K = C, iΩis a Hermitian product of signature (m, m).
We can identify these symplectic groups with unitary groups, namely
Sp(2m, C) ∼= SU(m, m)
(9.82)
and in particular
Sp(4, C) ∼= SU(2, 2),
(9.83)
Sp(6, C) ∼= SU(3, 3).
(9.84)

Chapter 10
Lie Groups and Lie Algebras
10.1
Lie Groups
A Lie group G, named after the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, is
a group whose elements depend smoothly on some number of parameters,
and on which the group operations
G × G −→G,
(10.1)
(X, Y ) −→X−1Y,
(10.2)
are smooth. Most of the Lie groups considered here are matrix groups,
whose elements are n × n matrices over some division algebra, and whose
group operation is matrix multiplication. The simplest example is SO(2),
the rotation group in two dimensions.
As discussed in Section 6.2, the
elements of SO(2) take the form
M(α) =
cos α −sin α
sin α
cos α

(10.3)
which clearly depends smoothly on α. Furthermore, we have
M(0) = I,
(10.4)
M(α + β) = M(α)M(β),
(10.5)
where I denotes the (in this case, 2 × 2) identity matrix. We refer to
{M(α) : α ∈R}
as a 1-parameter family of group elements if it satisﬁes (10.4) and (10.5).
We are interested primarily in Lie groups that are connected to the identity,
in which case every element belongs to at least one 1-parameter family.
The dimension |G| of a Lie group G is the number of indepen-
dent parameters needed to describe it.
For example, SO(2) is clearly a
77

78
The Geometry of the Octonions
1-dimensional Lie group. What about SO(3)? There are three independent
rotations in SO(3), which correctly suggests that the dimension of SO(3)
is three. Alternatively, any rotation in three dimensions can be expressed
as a product of three rotations about given, ﬁxed axes, for instance using
Euler angles. More generally, there are
n
2

= n(n−1)
2
independent planes
in n dimensions, so that
|SO(n)| = n(n −1)
2
.
(10.6)
Similar arguments can be used to show that
|SU(n)| = n2 −1,
(10.7)
|Sp(n)| = n(2n + 1).
(10.8)
10.2
Lie Algebras
A Lie algebra, again named after Sophus Lie, is a vector space g together
with a binary operation
g × g −→g,
(10.9)
(x, y) −→[x, y],
(10.10)
called the Lie bracket of x and y. The Lie bracket is bilinear and satisﬁes
[x, y] + [y, x] = 0,
(10.11)
[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0,
(10.12)
where the second condition is known as the Jacobi identity. Lie algebras
can be thought of as inﬁnitesimal Lie groups. More formally, a Lie algebra
is the tangent space of the Lie group at the origin, representing inﬁnitesimal
“displacements” in all possible “directions” there.
For matrix Lie groups, each 1-parameter family M(α) yields an element
A of the corresponding Lie algebra via
A = ˙M = ∂M
∂α

α=0
(10.13)
which is again a matrix. This operation can be reversed through matrix
exponentiation (which can be deﬁned formally using power series); we have
M(α) = exp( ˙Mα).
(10.14)
The Lie bracket on a matrix Lie algebra is just the ordinary commutator,
that is
[x, y] = xy −yx.
(10.15)

Lie Groups and Lie Algebras
79
This operation on matrices clearly satisﬁes (10.11), and a straightforward
computation shows that (10.12) is satisﬁed as well.
The simplest Lie algebra is so(2), the inﬁnitesimal version of the Lie
group SO(2), which is the vector space generated by
A = ∂
∂α
cos α −sin α
sin α
cos α
 
α=0
=
0 −1
1
0

.
(10.16)
Thus, so(2) consists of all real multiplies of A, and is isomorphic to the
1-dimensional vector space R. All commutators on so(2) vanish.
The simplest nontrivial Lie algebra is so(3), the inﬁnitesimal version
of SO(3), which, as shown in Section 7.3, is generated by (−i times) the
Pauli matrices. This factor of i represents a major notational diﬀerence
between two standard notations: Physicists typically insert an i into the
diﬀerentiation operation (10.13), so that the resulting inﬁnitesimal rota-
tion matrices are Hermitian, whereas mathematicians typically omit this i,
resulting in anti-Hermitian inﬁnitesimal rotation matrices. Adopting this
latter convention, so(3) is generated by
τx = −iσx

(10.19)
which satisfy the commutation relations
[τx, τy] = τz,
(10.20)
[τy, τz] = τx,
(10.21)
[τz, τx] = τy.
(10.22)
The dimension |g| of a Lie algebra g is its dimension as a vector space,
which is the same as the dimension of the corresponding Lie group. Thus,
so(3) is a 3-dimensional Lie algebra, and, more generally,
|so(n)| = n(n −1)
2
.
(10.23)
Furthermore, there are no double cover issues with Lie algebras, so
su(2) ∼= so(3)
(10.24)
without need to involve the spin group Spin(3) (whose Lie algebra is there-
fore also so(3)).

The Geometry of the Octonions
10.3
The Classiﬁcation of Lie Groups
The complete classiﬁcation of Lie algebras is one of the major results in
mathematics, providing a description of the building blocks of all continuous
symmetry groups.
This classiﬁcation was ﬁrst outlined by the German
mathematician Wilhelm Killing in the late 1800s, and the ﬁrst rigorous
construction was provided by French mathematician ´Elie Cartan shortly
thereafter; both Killing and Cartan worked with complex Lie algebras.
We consider here only simple Lie algebras, namely Lie algebras which
contain no nontrivial ideals. We also treat the abelian Lie algebra so(2) as
a special case, which is isomorphic as a vector space to R, and in which all
commutators vanish.1 An ideal h of a Lie algebra g is a subalgebra of g
with the property that all commutators in g involving one element of h
yield another element of h, that is, for which
X ∈h, Y ∈g =⇒[X, Y ] ∈h.
(10.25)
The zero set {0} and the entire Lie algebra g are both ideals of g; a simple
Lie algebra has no other ideals. Roughly speaking, this means that any
proper subalgebra of g also mixes up the remaining elements of g with each
other.
The classiﬁcation of simple Lie algebras proceeds roughly as follows.
First, construct the largest possible subalgebra h of g such that all elements
of h commute with each other. There are many ways to do this, but r = |h|
is the same in each case, and is called the rank of the Lie algebra, while h
itself is called a Cartan subalgebra of g. Now ﬁx a basis of h, and consider
the action of these |h| elements on (the rest of) g. Since our basis elements
commute, we can ﬁnd simultaneous eigenvectors for them (this is why the
classiﬁcation is done over C rather than R), and in fact we can ﬁnd a basis of
g−h that consists entirely of simultaneous eigenvectors. The corresponding
eigenvalues are vectors in Rr, called the root system of g. The geometry
of root systems turns out to be tightly constrained, and can be used to
completely classify all simple Lie algebras.
This process sounds harder than it is in practice, so we give an example.
We already know from Section 10.2, that a basis for the Lie algebra su(2) is
{τx, τy, τz}, none of which commute with each other. Any Cartan subalge-
bra h will therefore be 1-dimensional, so we pick h = ⟨τz⟩, the 1-dimensional
vector space with basis {τz}. The (complex) eigenvectors of τz are
[τz, iτx ∓τy] = iτy ± τx = ∓i(iτx ∓τy).
(10.26)
1There is ambiguity in the literature as to whether so(2) should be considered “simple”.

as the quantum operator corresponding to (the z-component of) spin, and
L± = iℏ(τx ∓τy) = ℏ
2 (σx ± iσy)
(10.28)
as the corresponding raising and lowering operators.
The classiﬁcation
of simple Lie algebras extends this construction to all (simple) symmetry
groups—and works with anti-Hermitian matrices, rather than Hermitian
matrices.
The geometric properties of root systems divide them into four inﬁnite
families, labeled ar, br, cr, and dr, where r is the rank, as well as ﬁve
remaining cases, labeled g2, f4, e6, e7, and e8; these latter ﬁve algebras are
referred to as the exceptional Lie algebras. It turns out that
ar ∼= su(r + 1)
(r ≥1),
(10.29)
br ∼= so(2r + 1)
(r > 1),
(10.30)
cr ∼= sp(r)
(r ≥3),
(10.31)
dr ∼= so(2r)
(r ≥4),
(10.32)
where the restrictions on the rank are to prevent overlaps, since
a1 ∼= b1 ∼= c1,
(10.33)
b2 ∼= c2,
(10.34)
a3 ∼= d3,
(10.35)
while d1 ∼= so(2) ∼= R and d2 ∼= so(4) ∼= so(2) ⊕so(2) are not simple.
The root diagrams for the rank two Lie algebras a2, b2, d2, and g2 are
shown in Figure 10.1. Each arrow represents a root; there are |g|−|h| roots
in all, since the Cartan elements are not included. The overall scale is a
matter of convention, but the relative scale within each diagram is not.
Further discussion of the construction of root diagrams can be found in [6].

The Geometry of the Octonions
Comparing the list of simple Lie algebras and their corresponding Lie
groups with our previous results, we see that the a family corresponds to the
unitary groups SU(n) = SU(n, C), the b and d families together correspond
to the orthogonal groups SO(n) = SU(n, R), and the c family corresponds
to the symplectic groups Sp(n) = SU(n, H). Do the remaining, exceptional
Lie algebras correspond to Lie groups over the octonions? Yes, indeed! We
will return to this discussion in Chapter 11.
10.4
Real Forms
A simple Lie algebra admits a non-degenerate inner product, called the
Killing form. For complex matrix Lie algebras, the Killing form can be
taken to be
B(X, Y ) = tr (XY ).
(10.36)
A vector space with a non-degenerate inner product admits an orthonormal
basis {Xm} satisfying
B(Xm, Xn) = ±δmn
(10.37)
where δmn denotes the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if m = n and 0 otherwise.
Consider the Lie algebra so(3, 1), corresponding to the Lorentz group
SO(3, 1) considered in Sections 6.6 and 9.3. Since Lie algebras represent
inﬁnitesimal transformations, the question of double covers never arises.
For example, at the Lie algebra level,
su(2) ∼= so(3),
(10.38)
sl(2, C) ∼= so(3, 1).
(10.39)
Recalling that the Pauli matrices σm each square to the identity matrix, and
that the generators of su(2) are τm = −iσm, we see that the Killing form
is negative deﬁnite on su(2). What about the boosts? The inﬁnitesimal
boosts in sl(2, C) are just the Pauli matrices themselves! We are therefore
led to identify elements with negative squared Killing norm as rotations,
and elements with positive squared Killing norm as boosts.
The classiﬁcation of simple Lie algebras outlined in Section 10.3 involved
complex Lie algebras. But we have just argued that the complexiﬁcation of
su(2) is precisely the complex Lie algebra sl(2, C)! Put diﬀerently, a com-
plex Lie algebra always contains an equal number of boosts and rotations,
since you can multiply by i to get from one to the other.

Lie Groups and Lie Algebras
83
Physical symmetry groups, however, correspond to real Lie algebras.
Such Lie algebras can be represented using complex matrices; what makes
them real is that the commutators between elements must all have real
coeﬃcients. These coeﬃcients are called structure constants. As a complex
Lie algebra, sl(2, C) has just three independent elements—and multiplica-
tion by i is allowed. As a real Lie algebra, sl(2, C) has six independent
elements—since multiplication by i is not allowed.
From now on, we work exclusively with real Lie algebras.
As with
su(2) ⊂sl(2, C), every real Lie algebra can be regarded as a subalgebra of
a complex Lie algebra. But how many real subalgebras does a complex Lie
algebra have?
In the case of sl(2, C), it is easy to see that we must choose either
σx or τx.
If we have both, then either there are no other elements, in
which case the algebra is abelian (and not simple), or it includes all of
sl(2, C). Similar considerations apply to the y and z basis elements. It
therefore appears that we have 23 = 8 possible 3-dimensional real sub-
algebras. However, remember that the structure constants must be real;
the algebra must close, with real coeﬃcients. Due to the cyclic symmetry
among x, y, and z, there are only two inequivalent 3-dimensional real sub-
algebras of sl(2, C), generated either by {τx, τy, τz} or by {σx, σy, τz}. We
say that there are two real forms of a1 = su(2), namely su(2) (all rotations),
and su(1, 1) = so(2, 1) (two boosts and one rotation). Since rotations have
compact orbits (and boosts do not), the Lie groups corresponding to real
forms containing only rotations are themselves compact. We use the same
language for Lie groups: The two real forms of SO(3) are SO(3) itself, which
is compact, and SO(2, 1), which is not.
This idea carries over to real forms of other Lie algebras. Diﬀerent real
forms of a given Lie algebra must all have the same complexiﬁcation, that
is, they are diﬀerent real subalgebras of a given complex Lie algebra. In
most cases, each such real form is fully determined by giving its Killing–
Cartan classiﬁcation and the number of boosts it contains. Determining
the allowed number of boosts requires checking under what circumstances
the structure constants are real. We already know some examples: Each
so(p, q) is a real form of so(p + q) (namely the one with pq boosts), and
each su(p, q) is a real form of su(p + q) (namely the one with 2pq boosts).
But these are not the only real forms.

The Exceptional Groups
11.1
The Geometry of G2
What are the symmetries of the division algebras R, C, H, and O? Let’s
start with H. The labeling i, j, k is arbitrary; any right-handed, orthonor-
mal basis of Im O could be used instead of i, j, k. This freedom represents
a geometric symmetry, corresponding to the rigid rotations on the unit
sphere in the 3-dimensional vector space of imaginary quaternions. But
this symmetry is also algebraic, since the choice of handedness ensures that
the multiplication table is preserved.
More formally, we deﬁne the isometry group SO(Im K) to be the group
of orientation- and norm-preserving transformations on the (normed) vec-
tor space Im K of imaginary elements of K, and we deﬁne the automorphism
group Aut(K) to be the transformations Φ on K that preserve the multi-
plication table, that is, that satisfy
Φ(pq) = Φ(p) Φ(q).
(11.1)
Any automorphism must preserve the identity element, that is,
Φ(1) = 1
(11.2)
so that Aut(K) acts only on Im K. Over the quaternions, we have
Aut(H) = SO(Im H) = SO(3).
(11.3)
What are the symmetries of C? The imaginary complex numbers Im C
form a 1-dimensional vector space, whose only symmetry is the orientation-
reversing transformation i −→−i. This transformation is in fact an auto-
morphism, but such discrete transformations do not generate 1-parameter
families. And R contain no imaginary units; its isometry and automorphism
groups are trivial.
85

86
The Geometry of the Octonions
What about the octonions? There are seven basis imaginary units, so
the isometry group is clearly
SO(Im O) = SO(7).
(11.4)
However, a simple counting argument shows that not all of the 21 elements
of SO(7) can be automorphisms.
Any automorphism of O must take i somewhere. Since the imaginary
units form a 6-sphere in Im O, there are six degrees of freedom in where i
can go. Next, we place j. Where can it go? Somewhere on the 6-sphere,
but orthogonal to i, corresponding to an additional ﬁve degrees of freedom.
However, once i and j have been placed, we have no choice in where we
put k, since Φ(k) = Φ(i)Φ(j). Having placed i, j, k, we must put ℓon
the 6-sphere so that it is orthogonal to each of them, corresponding to
6 −3 = 3 additional degrees of freedom. The remaining basis units, iℓ, jℓ,
kℓ, are again constrained by the automorphism property. Thus, there are
6 + 5 + 3 = 14 choices we can make, and we expect
|Aut(O)| = 14.
(11.5)
The automorphism group Aut(O) is the smallest of the exceptional Lie
groups, and is classiﬁed as G2, that is
G2 = Aut(O).
(11.6)
But what are the 14 independent automorphisms of O?
Consider a rotation in the ij-plane. We know this transformation is an
automorphism of H, so the product of the rotated units is still k.1 But
we have also aﬀected products such as i(iℓ)—unless we also rotate by an
equal amount in the (iℓ)(jℓ)-plane. Direct calculation shows that this is
suﬃcient; the transformation
i −→i cos α −j sin α,
j −→i sin α + j cos α,
k −→k,
kℓ−→kℓ,
jℓ−→iℓsin α + jℓcosα,
iℓ−→iℓcosα −jℓsin α,
ℓ−→ℓ,
(11.7)
1This statement is equivalent to the more familiar statement that the cross product of
any two (oriented) unit vectors in the xy-plane gives the unit vector in the z-direction.

is an automorphism of O for each value of α.
How many such (families of) automorphisms are there? We rotated two
planes, but there is a relationship between the planes. We say that the
ij-plane “points” to ij = k. Similarly, the (jℓ)(iℓ) plane also points to k.
Thus, a better description of our automorphism is that it involves equal
but opposite rotations in two planes that point to the same unit. There are
seven units that can be pointed to, and in each case three choices of a pair
of planes pointing to that unit. We therefore have 21 automorphisms of
this form, but not all of them are independent.
Which planes point to k?
Which basis units multiply to k?
There
are three lines intersecting at each point in the multiplication table of O,
represented in terms of the 7-point projective plane, so there are three such
pairs of units, in this case
k = ij = (jℓ)(iℓ) = ℓ(kℓ).
(11.8)
An element of G2 “pointing” to kℓis illustrated in the ﬁrst diagram in
Figure 11.1. However, combining any two pairs of rotations (by the same
angle) yields the third pair, so only two of these three automorphisms are
independent. Thus, we have precisely 7 × 2 = 14 independent automor-
phisms, which generate G2. But which 14 automorphisms should we pick
to be our basis?
We adopt the following strategy. Choose one octonion to be special,
say ℓ. At each of the six points other than ℓin the projective plane, three
lines intersect. One of these lines contains ℓ, and the other two do not.
Thus, there is a preferred pair of planes pointing to each unit other than ℓ.
For example, our construction above started by rotating the ij- and (jℓ)(iℓ)-
planes by equal and opposite amounts—and leaving the ℓ(kℓ)-plane alone.

88
The Geometry of the Octonions
Call this automorphism Ak.
Rather than picking one of the other two
automorphisms pointing to k as special, take their diﬀerence, and call it Gk.
With a particular choice of orientation, Gk will rotate the ij- and (jℓ)(iℓ)-
planes by the same amount—and will rotate the ℓ(kℓ)-plane by twice as
much in the opposite direction. Repeat this construction for automorphisms
pointing to the other units, and make an arbitrary choice of which pair of
planes to use when constructing Aℓ. The 14 transformations {Am, Gm}
generate G2. The G2 elements Akℓand Gkℓare illustrated in Figure 11.1.
We are not quite done. There is a third independent rotation, call it Sm,
pointing to each unit m, namely the transformation that rotates all three
planes in the same direction. For example, Sk rotates the ij-, (jℓ)(iℓ)-, and
ℓ(kℓ)-planes by equal amounts in the same direction. The rotations Sm are
of course not in G2, but they are precisely the seven extra rotations needed
to extend G2 to SO(7).
Having treated ℓas special, it is of interest to know what subgroups
of G2 and SO(7) leave ℓinvariant. We constructed the Am precisely so
that they would ﬁx ℓ, so the subgroup of G2 that ﬁxes ℓis generated by
the seven transformations Am together with Gℓ—any rotation in planes
pointing to ℓmust ﬁx ℓ. These eight transformations turn out to generate
a copy of SU(3).
The subgroup of SO(7) that ﬁxes one of the units is
of course SO(6), which must contain this SU(3). Since |SU(3)| = 8 and
|SO(6)| = 15, we are missing seven independent elements of SO(6). Which
ones?
The rotations that rotate two planes pointing to m in the same
direction, leaving the third alone. For example, pointing to k, the missing
element of SO(6) can be chosen to be the rotation rotating the ij- and
(jℓ)(iℓ)-planes by the same amount in the same direction.
11.2
The Albert Algebra
In order to discuss the remaining four exceptional Lie groups, we introduce
the algebra of 3 × 3 octonionic Hermitian matrices, known as the Albert
algebra, written as H3(O). Since the product of Hermitian matrices is not
necessarily Hermitian, we introduce the Jordan product
A ◦B = 1
2(AB + BA)
(11.9)
for elements A, B ∈H3(O), which we henceforth refer to as Jordan matri-
ces. It is easily checked that the Jordan product takes Hermitian matrices
to Hermitian matrices, is (obviously) commutative, but is not associative.

The Exceptional Groups
89
A Jordan algebra is an algebra with a commutative product ◦that also
satisﬁes
(A ◦B) ◦A2 = A ◦(B ◦A2)
(11.10)
where of course
A2 = A ◦A.
(11.11)
Jordan algebras were introduced by the German mathematical physicist
Pascual Jordan in order to represent observables in quantum mechanics.
All Jordan algebras except the Albert algebra arise by introducing the Jor-
dan product on an associative algebra; the Albert algebra is therefore also
referred to as the exceptional Jordan algebra. Higher powers must be ex-
plicitly deﬁned, such as
A3 = A2 ◦A = A ◦A2.
(11.12)
We also introduce the Freudenthal product of two Jordan matrices A
and B, given by
A ∗B = A ◦B −1
2

A tr (B) + B tr (A)

(11.13)
+ 1
2

tr (A) tr (B) −tr (A ◦B)

(11.14)
where the identity matrix is implicit in the last term. The determinant of
a Jordan matrix can then be deﬁned as
det(A) = 1
3 tr

(A ∗A) ◦A

.
(11.15)
Concretely, if
A =


p a
c
a m b
c
b
n


(11.16)
with p, m, n ∈R and a, b, c ∈O then
det A = pmn + c(ba) + c(ba) −n|a|2 −p|b|2 −m|c|2.
(11.17)
These products become somewhat less mysterious if we consider the
restriction of O to R, and suppose that
A = vv†,
B = ww†,
(11.18)
where v, w ∈R3 (and of course Hermitian conjugation, denoted by †, re-
duces to the matrix transpose). In this case,
tr (A ◦B) = (v · w)2,
(11.19)
A ∗B = (v × w)(v × w)†,
(11.20)
where · and × denote the ordinary dot and cross product. The Jordan
product ◦and the Freudenthal product ∗can therefore be thought of as
generalizations of the dot and cross products, respectively.

90
The Geometry of the Octonions
11.3
The Geometry of F4
As suggested in Section 11.2, the Albert algebra H3(O) can be regarded
as a generalization of the vector space R3 to the octonions. The elements
X ∈H3(O) of the Albert algebra are Hermitian matrices, and have well-
deﬁned determinants.
We therefore seek transformations that preserve
these properties.
Reasoning by analogy with Section 7.3, we seek transformations of the
form
X −→MXM†
(11.21)
that preserve the determinant and trace of X; this group would deserve the
name SU(3, O).
Before proceeding further, however, we must ask under what circum-
stances MXM† is well-deﬁned, that is, when is it true that
(MX)M† = M(XM†).
(11.22)
As in Section 9.3, we therefore assume that the elements of M lie in some
complex subalgebra of O, which can be diﬀerent for diﬀerent M, and we
will need to allow nesting, that is, not all transformations can be carried
out with a single M.
In Section 9.2, we showed that SU(2, O) ∼= SO(9).
There are three
obvious ways to embed 2 × 2 matrices inside 3 × 3 matrices, depending
on which row and column are ignored; we refer to these alternatives as
types.
Thus, SU(3, O) is contained in the union of the three copies of
SU(2, O), each of which has 36 elements.
However, there is substantial
overlap between these three subgroups.
Recall from Section 9.1.4 that left, right, and symmetric multiplication
over O all yield representations of SO(8), related by triality. Consider now
the three independent oﬀ-diagonal elements of a Jordan matrix X, each of
which is of course an element of O. Consider further the diagonal elements
of SU(2, O), embedded (in three ways) in SU(3, O), acting on X; such
elements take the form2
M =


p 0 0
0 p 0
0 0 1


(11.23)
2Elements of type (11.23) must in general be nested.

with p2 = −1, or
M =


q 0 0
0 q 0
0 0 1


(11.24)
where |q| = 1, or cyclic permutations of these matrices. Under (11.21), each
such transformation leaves the diagonal of X alone, and acts separately on
the three oﬀ-diagonal elements, in each case implementing one of the three
representations of SO(8).
We conclude that the three copies of SO(8), coming from the three copies
of SU(2, O) embedded in SU(3, O), must in fact be the same, which is an
important consequence of triality. Redoing our count, we now have a single
copy of SO(8), with its 28 elements. However, the eight remaining trans-
formations coming from each copy of SU(2, O) are indeed diﬀerent (since
they act on diﬀerent pairs of diagonal elements), so we have 28 + 3 × 8 = 52
elements in all, that is,
|SU(3, O)| = 52.
(11.25)
This group is one of the exceptional Lie groups, and is classiﬁed as F4, that
is,
F4 = SU(3, O).
(11.26)
We digress brieﬂy to discuss some further properties of triality, which
play an essential role in the above description of F4. Including cyclic permu-
tations, there are only 14 independent transformations of the form (11.24),
since the third set of seven can be constructed from the other two. These
14 transformations act on the three octonions in X, acting on one octonion
by symmetric multiplication, another by left multiplication, and the third
by right multiplication.
Each of these transformations is in SO(8), but
they are diﬀerent from each other, related by triality. As for the remain-
ing transformations, of the form (11.23), there appear to be only seven of
them, but there are really
7
2

= 21, due to nesting. However, seven of these
can also be represented using (cyclically permuted) transformations of the
form (11.24); the remaining 14 transformations, which can only be repre-
sented using nesting, are precisely the generators of G2. In this case, and
only in this case, symmetric, left, and right multiplication yield the same
transformation in SO(8), a property that we refer to as strong triality. An
example of strong triality is the identity
−i(j(kxk)j)i = −i(j(kx)) = ((xk)j)i
(11.27)

92
The Geometry of the Octonions
for any x ∈O (where the minus signs are needed due to the odd number of
factors in this nonstandard instance of nesting).
We conclude this section by listing an explicit set of 52 generators for F4.
• There are seven independent elements of the form (11.23), which
when nested yield the
7


= 14 generators of G2. Since a rotation
in a single plane is represented by two nested ﬂips, a typical G2
transformation involving two such rotations requires four nested
ﬂips. An example of such a G2 transformation is

q , and
RIII
q
, respectively.
We have exhibited an explicit set of 14 + 7 + 7 + 3 × 8 = 52 generators for
F4, as claimed.
11.4
The Geometry of E6
In Section 11.3, we discussed the transformations that preserve the deter-
minant and trace of Jordan matrices X ∈H3(O); such transformations are
elements the group F4 = SU(3, O). It is now straightforward to remove the
restriction on the trace, and consider all transformations on H3(O) that
preserve the determinant; this group would deserve the name SL(3, O).
Again, we make use of our knowledge of the 2 × 2 case, in this case the
transition from SU(2, O) ∼= Spin(9) to SL(2, O) ∼= Spin(9, 1), as discussed
in Sections 9.2 and 9.3. This transition involves the addition of nine boosts,
and there are three natural embeddings of 2×2 matrices inside 3×3 matrices
(“types”), so we expect to add 3 × 9 = 27 boosts to SU(3, O) in order to
get SL(3, O). However, three of these boosts are diagonal matrices, namely
the boosts with “z”, and only two of these are independent. Thus, SL(3, O)
contains 52 + 26 = 78 elements, that is,
|SL(3, O)| = 78.
(11.36)
This group is another of the exceptional Lie groups, and is classiﬁed as E6.
More precisely, SL(3, O) is a particular real form of E6, namely the one
with 52 rotations and 26 boosts; its signature is therefore 26 −52 = −26,
and we write
E6(−26) = SL(3, O).
(11.37)
For completeness, we list the 78 elements of SL(3, O) here explicitly.

all of these groups are subgroups of SL(3, O), as is SL(2, O). The elements
of these subgroups are also identiﬁed below.

The Geometry of E74
Freudenthal [8] provided a description of the Lie algebra e7(−25), denoted
throughout this section simply as e7.
Barton & Sudbery [9] showed al-
gebraically how to interpret this Lie algebra as the symplectic algebra
sp(6, O).
Here we discuss the geometric interpretation of this symplec-
tic algebra [7], providing a natural symplectic interpretation of its minimal
representation. We work throughout with the Lie algebra, but, given our
explicit matrix description of E6(−26) in terms of nested operations, it is not
diﬃcult to reinterpret our discussion at the group level. In particular, since
a Lie algebra is just an inﬁnitesimal representation of a Lie group, both act
on the same vector spaces. Our geometric description of the vector space
being acted on therefore applies equally well in both cases, even though the
objects (nested matrices) acting on it diﬀer.
Let X, Y ∈H3(O) be elements of the Albert algebra, that is, 3 × 3
Hermitian matrices whose components are octonions. As discussed at the
group level in Section 11.4, the Lie algebra e6(−26) (henceforth denoted e6)
acts on the Albert algebra H3(O). The generators of e6 fall into one of
three categories; there are 26 boosts, 14 derivations,5 and 38 other rotations
(the remaining generators of f4). For both boosts and rotations, φ ∈e6 can
be treated as a 3 × 3, tracefree, octonionic matrix; boosts are Hermitian,
and rotations are anti-Hermitian. Such matrices φ ∈e6 act on the Albert
algebra via6
X −→φX + Xφ†
(11.42)
where † denotes conjugate transpose (in O). As discussed at the group
level for automorphisms in Sections 11.1 and 11.3, the derivations can be
obtained by successive rotations (or boosts) through nesting, corresponding
to commutators in the Lie algebra. It therefore suﬃces to consider the
boosts and rotations, that is, to consider matrix transformations.7
4The material in this section is adapted from [7].
5Derivations are inﬁnitesimal automorphisms, so from (11.1) we see that the derivations
of K satisfy φ(pq) = φ(p) q +p φ(q) for all p, q ∈K. The derivations of O are the elements
of g2.
6This action is the inﬁnitesimal version of the group action X −→MXM†. As an
element of a Lie group, M can be assumed to be part of a 1-parameter family M(λ),
with M(0) = I. Then φ is just dM
dλ
˛˛˛
λ=0, and (11.42) follows from the product rule.
7Since all rotations can be obtained from pairs of boosts, it would be enough to consider
boosts alone.

96
The Geometry of the Octonions
The dual representation of e6 is formed by the duals φ′ of each φ ∈e6,
deﬁned via
tr

φ(X) ◦Y

= −tr

X ◦φ′(Y)

(11.43)
for X, Y ∈H3(O). It is easily checked that φ′ = φ on rotations, but that
φ′ = −φ on boosts. Thus,
φ′ = −φ†
(11.44)
for both boosts and rotations.
We can regard e7 as the conformal algebra associated with e6, since e7
consists of the 78 elements of e6, together with 27 translations, 27 conformal
translations, and a dilation. We follow Freudenthal in representing elements
of e7 as
Θ = (φ, ρ, A, B)
(11.45)
where φ ∈e6, ρ ∈R is the dilation, and A, B ∈H3(O) are elements of the
Albert algebra, representing the translations.8
What does Θ act on? We again follow Freudenthal, who describes the
elements of the minimal representation of e7 in the form
P = (X, Y, p, q)
(11.46)
where X, Y ∈H3(O), and p, q ∈R, and then gives the action of Θ on P as
X −→φ(X) + 1
3 ρ X + 2B ∗Y + A q,
(11.47)
Y −→2A ∗X + φ′(Y) −1
3 ρ Y + B p,
(11.48)
p −→tr (A ◦Y) −ρ p,
(11.49)
q −→tr (B ◦X) + ρ q.
(11.50)
But how are we to visualize this action?

The Symplectic Structure of so(k + 2, 2)
Consider ﬁrst the analogous problem using 2 × 2 matrices [10–12]; see also
Section 15.1. Elements of so(k + 2, 2), where k = |K| = 1, 2, 4, 8, can be
represented in terms of actions on 4 × 4 matrices of the form
P0 =

(11.51)
8The translations and conformal translations are sums and diﬀerences of A and B,
which individually turn out be null, that is, neither boosts nor rotations.

where X is a 2 × 2 Hermitian matrix over K carrying a representation of
so(k + 1, 1) (see Section 9.3), p, q ∈R, I denotes the 2 × 2 identity matrix,
and tilde denotes trace-reversal, that is, 
X = X −tr (X) I. The matrix P0
can be thought of as the upper right 4×4 block of an 8×8 Cliﬀord algebra
representation over K, and the action of so(k + 2, 2) on P0 is obtained
as usual from (the restriction of) the quadratic elements of the Cliﬀord
algebra. The generators A ∈so(k + 2, 2) can be chosen so that the action
takes the form
P0 −→AP0 ± P0A
(11.52)
where the case-dependent signs are related to the restriction from 8 × 8
matrices to 4 × 4 matrices. Following Sudbery [4], we deﬁne the elements
A of the symplectic Lie algebra sp(4, K) by the condition9
AΩ+ ΩA† = 0
(11.53)
where
Ω=

Solutions of (11.53) take the form

2 ρ I

2 ρ I

(11.55)
where both A and B are Hermitian, tr (φ) = 0, and ρ ∈R. But gener-
ators of so(k + 2, 2) take exactly the same form: φ represents an element
of so(k + 1, 1), A and B are (null) translations, and ρ is the dilation. Di-
rect computation shows that the generators A of so(k + 2, 2) do indeed
satisfy (11.53), so that so(k + 2, 2) and sp(4, K) can be identiﬁed as vector
spaces, and hence also as Lie algebras; the above construction therefore
establishes the isomorphism
so(k + 2, 2) ∼= sp(4, K).
(11.56)
We can bring the representation (11.51) into a more explicitly symplectic
form by treating X as a vector-valued 1-form, and computing its Hodge
dual ∗X, deﬁned by
∗X = Xϵ
(11.57)
9The Lie algebra sp(4, K) also contains the isometry algebra of Im (K).

The diagonal blocks, labeled 00 and 11, are antisymmetric, and correspond
to p and q, respectively, whereas the oﬀ-diagonal blocks, labeled 01 and 10,
contain equivalent information, corresponding to ∗X. Note that ∗X does
not use up all of the degrees of freedom available in an oﬀ-diagonal block;
the set of all antisymmetric 4 × 4 matrices is not an irreducible represen-
tation of sp(4, K).
The action of sp(4, K) on P is given by
P −→AP + PAT
(11.61)
for A ∈sp(4, K), that is, for A satisfying (11.53).10 When working over
K = R or C, the action (11.61) is just the antisymmetric square
v ∧w −→Av ∧w + v ∧Aw
(11.62)
of the natural representation v −→Av, with v ∈K4.
10Thus, (11.61) can be used if desired to determine the signs in (11.52).

11.5.2
Cubies
Before generalizing the above construction to the 3×3 case, we ﬁrst consider
the analog of ∗X. Let X ∈H3(O) be an element of the Albert algebra,
which we can regard as a vector-valued 1-form with components Xab, with
a, b ∈{1, 2, 3}. The Hodge dual ∗X of X is a vector-valued 2-form with
components
(∗X)abc = Xamϵmbc
(11.63)
where ϵabc denotes the Levi-Civita tensor in three dimensions, that is, the
completely antisymmetric tensor satisfying
ϵ123 = 1
(11.64)
and where repeated indices are summed over. We refer to ∗X as a cubie.
We also introduce the dual of ϵabc, the completely antisymmetric tensor
ϵabc satisfying
ϵmnsϵmns = 6
(11.65)
and note the further identities
ϵamn ϵbmn = 2 δab,
(11.66)
ϵabm ϵcdm = δac δbd −δad δbc,

ϵabc ϵdef = δad δbe δcf + δbd δce δaf + δcd δae δbf

(11.77)
where I denotes the 3 × 3 identity matrix. By analogy with Section 11.5.1,
we would like Θ to act on ∗X, which has three indices, and is antisymmetric
in two of them, and hence has the correct symmetries to be an oﬀ-diagonal
block of a rank three antisymmetric tensor P. The components of P make

up a 6 × 6 × 6 cube, which we divide into 3 × 3 × 3 cubies, as shown
in Figure 11.3; compare Figure 11.2.
We identity the diagonal cubies,
labeled 000 and 111, with p ∗I and q ∗I, respectively, the cubie labeled 011
with ∗X, the cubie labeled 100 with ∗Y, and then let antisymmetry do the
rest. Explicitly, we have

a ≥4, b ≥4, c ≥4
(11.78)
where we have introduced the convention that a = a −3, and where the
remaining components are determined by antisymmetry.12
In the complex case, we could begin with the natural action of Θ on
6-component complex vectors, and then take the antisymmetric cube, that
is, we could consider the action
u ∧v ∧w −→Θu ∧v ∧w + u ∧Θv ∧w + u ∧v ∧Θw
(11.79)
with u, v, w ∈C6, or equivalently
Pabc −→Θa

(11.80)
Over the octonions, however, the action (11.80) must be modiﬁed and rein-
terpreted in order to yield the Freudenthal action (11.47). We summarize
the resulting description below; see [7] for further details.
The basic idea is to reorder (11.80), using instead the action
Pabc −→ΘamPmbc + PamcΘbm + PabmΘcm
(11.81)
which, however, is only antisymmetric in its last two indices. We therefore
use (11.81) to deﬁne the action only on cubies 000, 011, 100, and 111; the
action on the remaining four cubies is uniquely determined by requiring
that antisymmetry be preserved. This approach succeeds, thanks to the
following results [7], which we state without proof.
Lemma 11.1. The action of φ ∈e6 on cubies is given by
(∗X)abc −→φam(∗X)mbc + (∗X)amcφ′
b
m + (∗X)abmφ′
c
m.
(11.82)
Lemma 11.2. The action of the dilation Θ = (0, ρ, 0, 0) ∈e7 on P is given
by (11.80).
12Note that P is a cube, and has components Pabc with a, b, c ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, whereas
ϵabc, ∗Xabc, and ∗Yabc are the components of cubies, which are subblocks of P, with
a, b, c ∈{1, 2, 3}.

102
The Geometry of the Octonions
Lemma 11.3. If the elements of A, B ∈H3(O) commute with those of P,
then the action of the translations Θ = (0, 0, A, 0) and Θ = (0, 0, 0, B) on
P is given by (11.80).
Over R or C, we’re done; Lemmas 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 together suﬃce to
show that the action (11.80) is the same as the Freudenthal action (11.47)–
(11.50). Unfortunately, the action (11.80) fails to satisfy the Jacobi identity
over H or O. However, we can still use Lemmas 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3 to
reproduce the Freudenthal action in those cases, as follows.
Lemma 11.4. The action of Θ = (φ, 0, 0, 0) ∈e7 on P is determined
by (11.81) when acting on elements of the form (11.78), which extends to
all of e7 by antisymmetry.
Putting these pieces together, we obtain the ﬁnal result.
Theorem 11.1. The Lie algebra e7 acts symplectically on cubes, that is,
e6 ⊂e7 acts on cubes via (11.81), as do real translations and the dila-
tion, and all other e7 transformations can then be constructed from these
transformations using linear combinations and commutators.
Proof. Lemmas 11.2 and 11.3 are unchanged by the use of (11.81) rather
than (11.80), since the components of Θ commute with those of P in both
cases, and Lemma 11.4 veriﬁes that e6 acts via (11.81), as claimed. It only
remains to show that the remaining generators of e7 can be obtained from
these elements via commutators.
Using (11.47)–(11.50), it is straightforward to compute the commutator
of two e7 transformations of the form (11.45). Letting φ = Q ∈e6 be a
boost, so that Q† = Q and tr (Q) = 0, and using the identity
−(A ◦B) ∗X =

B −tr (B)I

◦(A ∗X) + A ∗(B ◦X)
(11.83)
for any A, B, X ∈H3(O), we obtain

(0, 0, A, 0), (Q, 0, 0, 0)

= (0, 0, A ◦Q, 0).
(11.84)
We can therefore obtain the null translation (0, 0, Q, 0) for any tracefree
Albert algebra element Q as the commutator of (0, 0, I, 0) and (Q, 0, 0, 0);
a similar argument can be used to construct the null translation (0, 0, 0, Q).
Thus, all generators of e7 can be implemented either as a symplectic
transformation on cubes via (11.81), or as the commutator of two such
transformations.

Further Properties
We have showed that the algebraic description of the minimal representa-
tion of e7 introduced by Freudenthal corresponds geometrically to a sym-
plectic structure. Along the way, we have emphasized both the similarities
and diﬀerences between e7 and so(10, 2). Both of these algebras are con-
formal; their elements divide naturally into generalized rotations (e6 or
so(9, 1), respectively), translations, and a dilation. Both act naturally on a
representation built out of vectors (3×3 or 2×2 Hermitian octonionic ma-
trices, respectively), together with two additional real degrees of freedom
(p and q).13 In the 2 × 2 case, the representation (11.51) contains just one
vector; in the 3 ×3 case (11.46), there are two. This at ﬁrst puzzling diﬀer-
ence is fully explained by expressing both representations as antisymmetric
tensors, as in (11.60) and (11.78), respectively, and as shown geometrically
in Figures 11.2 and 11.3.
In the complex case, we have shown that the symplectic action (11.80)
exactly reproduces the Freudenthal action (11.47)–(11.50). The analogy
goes even further. In 2n dimensions, there is a natural map taking two
n-forms to a tensor of rank two. When acting on P (so n = 3), this map
takes the form
P −→PacdPefg ϵcdefgb
(11.85)
where ϵ now denotes the volume element in six dimensions, that is, the
completely antisymmetric tensor with ϵ123456 = 1. Freudenthal also gives
us a “squaring” operation on e7, namely the “super-Freudenthal” product ∗
taking elements P of the minimal representation of e7 to elements of e7,
given by14
P ∗P = (φ, ρ, A, B)
(11.86)
13The relations (11.63) and (11.69) can be used to identify any 3×3 matrix over K with
a “cubie-like” piece of a “cube-like” 3-form. However, the set of all such 3-forms does
not carry an irreducible representation of e7; in fact, it does not carry a representation
of e7 at all, as the algebra fails to close. Similar statements hold in the 2 × 2 case.
14We use ∗to denote this “super-Freudenthal” product because of its analogy to the
Freudenthal product ∗, with which there should be no confusion. Neither of these prod-
ucts is the same as the Hodge dual map, also denoted ∗.

ant (11.92) can be expressed in the complex case as
J ∼PgabPcdePfhiPjkl ϵabcdef ϵghijkl
(11.93)
up to an overall factor.
Neither the form of the action (11.80), nor the expressions (11.85)
and (11.93), hold over H or O. This failure should not be a surprise, as tri-
linear tensor products are not well deﬁned over H, let alone O. Nonetheless,
Theorem 11.1 does tell us how to extend (11.80) to the octonions. Although
it is also possible to write down versions of (11.85) and (11.93) that hold
over the octonions, by using case-dependent algorithms to determine the
order of multiplication, it is not clear that such expressions have any ad-
vantage over the original expressions (11.86)–(11.90) and (11.92) given by
Freudenthal.
Despite these drawbacks, it is clear from our construction that e7(−25)
should be regarded as a natural generalization of the traditional notion of a
symplectic Lie algebra, and fully deserves the name sp(6, O). Furthermore,
given our construction of E6 in terms of nested matrices acting on the
Albert algebra, it is not diﬃcult to extend the treatment given here from
the Lie algebra e7 to the Lie group E7, thus showing how E7 acts on cubies,
and justifying the identiﬁcation E7 ∼= Sp(6, O).

11.6
The Geometry of E8
It would be nice to extend our discussion to the last remaining exceptional
Lie group, namely E8. However, unlike the other exceptional Lie groups, E8
does not have any “small” representations; the minimal representation of E8
is the adjoint representation, with 248 elements. The minimal representa-
tion of G2 is O (7-dimensional), F4 acts on the trace-free part of the Albert
algebra (26-dimensional), E6 acts the Albert algebra (27-dimensional), and
E7 acts on {P = (X, Y, p, q)}, that is on two copies of the Albert algebra,
together with two real numbers (56-dimensional). But E8 acts on nothing
smaller than itself. (More precisely, E8 acts on its Lie algebra, e8.)
The geometry of E8 is therefore beyond the scope of this book.

12.1
The Hopf Bundles
Consider a complex column vector
v =
b
c

(12.1)
where b, c ∈C. What can we do with v? Well, we can take its Hermitian
conjugate, deﬁned in Section 7.1, namely
v† =

b c

.
(12.2)
We can now multiply v and v† in two quite diﬀerent ways. We can produce
a number
v†v = |b|2 + |c|2 ∈R
(12.3)
or, if we multiply in the opposite order, a matrix
vv† =

|b|2
bc
cb
|c|2

.
(12.4)
One way to visualize v is to think of it as a point in C2 = R4, in which
case (12.3) is just the usual (squared) vector norm. Suppose we normalize v
by requiring that v†v = 1. Then v lies on the unit sphere in R4, which is
3-dimensional, and hence denoted by S3.
What about vv†? This matrix is Hermitian! As discussed in Section 9.3,
we can therefore identify vv† with a vector in spacetime, via
t + z = |b|2,
(12.5)
t −z = |c|2,
(12.6)
x + iy = cb.
(12.7)
109

110
The Geometry of the Octonions
We can invert these relationships, obtaining1
t = 1
2 (|b|2 + |c|2),
(12.8)
z = 1
2 (|b|2 −|c|2),
(12.9)
x = 1
2 (cb + bc),
(12.10)
iy = 1
2 (cb −bc).
(12.11)
The normalization (12.3) of v tells us that t is constant, which also follows
immediately from
2t = tr (vv†) = v†v = 1.
(12.12)
So the trace of vv† is special; what about its determinant? We have
det(vv†) = |b|2|c|2 −(bc)(cb) = |b|2|c|2 −|bc|2 = |b|2|c|2 −|bc|2 = 0. (12.13)
Thus, vv† represents a null vector! Putting this all together, we have
x2 + y2 + z2 = t2 = constant
(12.14)
so that we can think of vv† as a point on a particular sphere, which we
denote by S2.
We have constructed a famous map between S3 and S2 known as the
Hopf map, which for us is simply given by
S3 −→S2,
v −→vv†.
(12.15)
This map is not one-to-one. After all, it takes three angles to specify a
point in S3, but only two to specify a point in S2.
What information have we lost in “squaring” v to get vv†? If we multiply
v by a phase, that is, a complex number of the form eiθ, then not only is
the norm (12.3) unchanged, but also the square! Explicitly, if
w = veiθ
(12.16)
then
ww† = vv†.
(12.17)
This phase freedom is associated with the circle S1 of unit complex
numbers—which includes antipodal points as a special case.
This copy

√
2 to eliminate the factors of 2 in these expressions.

111
of S1 is in fact also a group, denoted U(1), since the product of any two
unit complex numbers is another such number.
Not surprisingly, the above construction works over any of the division
algebras. Note the crucial use of the division algebra property in (12.13)
to conclude that vv† is a null vector! Thus, allowing the components of v
in turn to be in R, C, H, and O results in vv† being a null vector in
3, 4, 6, or 10 spacetime dimensions, respectively. Imposing the normaliza-
tion condition (12.3) allows vv† to be thought of as a point on the spheres
S1, S2, S4, and S8, respectively, while v can be interpreted as a point on
the spheres S1, S3, S7, and S15, respectively.
There are a couple of details to check. Over H, it is essential that the
phase freedom in (12.16) be written on the right. And of course the phase
is given by an arbitrary unit quaternion, corresponding to S3. Over O, we
must be even more careful in identifying the phase freedom; there appear to
be associativity issues in the transition from (12.16) to (12.17). However,
there is a way around this: vv† is really complex, since it contains only
one octonionic direction. It therefore admits a complex “square root” u. If
we apply the phase freedom to u, rather than v, the computation becomes
quaternionic; the associativity problems disappear. Explicitly, choosing2
u =
 bc
|c|
|c|

(12.18)
we have
uu† = vv†
(12.19)
and the most general column vector w satisfying (12.17) is
w = uξ
(12.20)
where the phase ξ is any unit octonion, which can be thought of as an
element of S7. We can recover v by putting ξ =
c
|c|.
Putting this all together, we obtain the four Hopf maps
S15 −→S8,
S7 −→S4,
S3 −→S2,
S1 −→S1.
(12.21)
It is remarkable that there are precisely four of these maps. It is even more
remarkable that they are related to the four division algebras.

The Geometry of the Octonions
Fig. 12.1
A M¨obius strip.
Fig. 12.2
The smallest Hopf bundle.
What do the Hopf maps look like? Consider ﬁrst a M¨obius strip, as
shown in Figure 12.1. The M¨obius strip is an example of a ﬁber bundle, in
which there is a base manifold, in this case the circle in the center of the
M¨obius strip, and a ﬁber, in this case a line segment, otherwise known as
the 1-dimensional disk, D1. The M¨obius strip is therefore a ﬁber bundle
over S1, with ﬁber D1. This bundle is nontrivial; it is not simply S1 × D1,
which would be a cylinder.
If we now change the ﬁbers by removing all but the endpoints of each
line segment, we are left with the ﬁber bundle shown in Figure 12.2. The
base space is still S1, but the ﬁbers now consist of two points, which is the
0-sphere, S0, consisting of all points in the line that lie a unit distance from
the origin. But these points also make up a circle! Thus, this ﬁber bundle
is itself S1, over S1, with ﬁber S0—and represents the smallest Hopf map,
as given above.
What about the next case, of S3 over S2, which is the original Hopf map?
The Hopf map is also referred to as the Hopf bundle, because it describes
S3 as a ﬁber bundle with base space S2 and ﬁber S1. Roughly speaking,
there is a copy of S1, given by the phase freedom, at each point of S2. For
the M¨obius strip, we obtained the ﬁber S0 as the boundary of D1; we apply
the same idea here. Since S3 is the boundary of D4, the disk (“ball”) in
four dimensions, we have
S3 = ∂D4 = ∂(D2 × D2)
= (∂D2 × D2) ∪(D2 × ∂D2) = (S1 × D2) ∪(D2 × S1)
∼= R3 ∪{∞}.
(12.22)
We can represent S3 as the points in R3, together with a point at inﬁnity,
as shown in Figure 12.3. There are two disks (D2) shown in this ﬁgure, one
inside the torus, the other in the xy plane, in the middle of the torus, but

outside it. Each disk represents a hemisphere of the basespace, with the
circles that intersect the disks representing the ﬁbers.3
The geometric representations of the ﬁrst two Hopf bundles shown in
Figures 12.2 and 12.3 are purely topological, as they fail to show the nor-
malization used in our algebraic construction above.
12.2
The Octonionic Projective Line
There is another way to view vv†, namely as an element in projective space.
Consider a pair of real numbers (b, c), and identify points on the same line
through the origin. This identiﬁcation can be thought of as introducing an
equivalence relation of the form
(b, c) ∼(bχ, cχ)
(12.23)
where 0 ̸= χ ∈R. The resulting space can be identiﬁed with the (unit)
circle of all possible directions in R2, with antipodal points identiﬁed. This
space is the real projective space RP1, also called the real projective line.
But this space can also be identiﬁed with the squares of normalized column
vectors v, that is,
RP1 = {vv† : v ∈R2, v†v = 1}
(12.24)
where we write † instead of T for transpose, anticipating a generalization
to the other division algebras.
The normalization condition can be written in terms of the trace, since
tr (vv†) = v†v.
(12.25)
3It is not easy to see in Figure 12.3 how the two hemispheres are glued together.

114
The Geometry of the Octonions
There is yet another way to write this condition, since
(vv†)(vv†) = v(v†v)v† =

tr (vv†)

(vv†).
(12.26)
Putting the pieces together, we obtain a matrix description of RP1 in terms
of 2 × 2 real Hermitian matrices (H2(R)), namely4
RP1 = {X ∈H2(R) : X2 = X, tr X = 1}.
(12.27)
Not surprisingly, all of this works over the other division algebras as
well; (12.26) holds even over O since v has only two components, so that
the computation takes place in a quaternionic subalgebra. Thus, (12.27)
can be used to deﬁne the projective spaces RP1, CP1, HP1, and OP1, which
are again known as projective lines.5
However, the traditional deﬁnition, using (12.23) rather than (12.27),
requires modiﬁcation over the octonions, along the lines of the discussion
in Section 12.1, One possible choice would be
OP1 = {(b, c) ∈O2 : (b, c) ∼

(bc−1)χ, χ

, 0 ̸= χ ∈O}
(12.28)
with c = 0 handled as a special case.
12.3
Spinors
In Section 9.3, we argued that spacetime vectors are better represented as
matrices than as column vectors. What, then, do column vectors represent?
In Section 12.1, we viewed two-component column vectors as vectors
in Rn for appropriate n; imposing a normalization condition led us to regard
these vectors as points in Sn−1. But this description is really nothing more
than counting the (real) degrees of freedom.
A better indication of what these column vectors represent is given by
the fact that they “square” to null vectors, in the sense of (12.15). These
are spinors, more precisely Weyl or Penrose spinors [14].
How do we “rotate” a spinor? How do we rotate the square root of
a vector? Comparing the Lorentz transformation (9.44) with the relation-
ship (12.17) between spinors and (null) vectors yields the answer: A Lorentz
transformation M acts on spinors via
v −→Mv.
(12.29)
4For 2×2 matrices X, the condition tr X = 1 is needed to rule out the identity matrix,
and ensures that det X = 0, which also forces one of the eigenvalues of X to be 0, which
in turn forces X = vv† for some v.
5A similar deﬁnition was given by Harvey (page 123 of [13]).

Division Algebras in Mathematics
115
How does the corresponding null vector transform? Equation (9.44) tells
us that
vv† −→M(vv†)M †.
(12.30)
Consistency would require that this vector be the square of Mv, so that
M(vv†)M † = (Mv)(v†M †) = (Mv)(Mv)†.
(12.31)
We refer to this condition as compatibility.
Over H, it is automatically
satisﬁed due to associativity, but over O it is a nontrivial condition. How-
ever, all of the generators given in Section 9.3 do satisfy this condition. We
will always assume that Lorentz transformations are described in terms of
a sequence of compatible generators.
Recall that a generator such as Rz, given in (9.50) in terms of a param-
eter θ, describes a rotation through an angle 2θ. If θ = π, corresponding to
a rotation through a full circle, then a vector X is unchanged. However,
Rz reduces to −I, rather than I. In particular, a spinor is not left un-
changed by this transformation; it requires a rotation by 4π (corresponding
to θ = 2π) to do that! This makes sense; since the spinor v is the square
root of the vector vv†, it “rotates” half as fast.
But what good are spinors? It turns out that spinors represent particles
with half-integer spin. But what does this mean? We will return to the
physics of spinors in Chapter 14.
12.4
M¨obius Transformations6
The unit sphere S2 ⊂R3 is related to the Riemann sphere (the complex
plane with a point at inﬁnity added) via stereographic projection from the
north pole, which takes the point (x, y, z), with x2 + y2 + z2 = 1, to the
point
w = x + iy
1 −z = 1 + z
x −iy .
(12.32)
Under this transformation, the north pole is mapped to the point at inﬁnity.
As discussed in detail by Penrose and Rindler [14], we can regard S2 as
the set of future (or past) null directions, and speciﬁcally as the intersection
of the future light cone of the origin in 4-dimensional Minkowski space with
the hypersurface t = 1. Other points on a given null ray are obtained by
6The material in this section is adapted from [15].

116
The Geometry of the Octonions
scaling with t, and we can extend stereographic projection to a map on the
entire light cone via
w = x + iy
t −z = t + z
x −iy
(12.33)
with the condition x2 + y2 + z2 = t2.
As discussed in Section 12.2, we can further identify S2 with the complex
projective space CP1, the space of complex lines in C2, which is given by
CP1 = {[(b, c)] ∈C2 : (b, c) ∼(ξb, ξc) ∀0 ̸= ξ ∈C}
(12.34)
where the square brackets denote equivalence classes under the equivalence
relation ∼. Then each [(b, c)] ∈CP1 can be identiﬁed with the point w in
the complex plane given by
w = b
c
(12.35)
which is further identiﬁed with a point in S2 via (12.32); [(b, 0)] is to be
identiﬁed with the north pole, corresponding to w = ∞. Stereographic
projection (12.32) can be thought of as a special case of (12.35) with b or c
real.
The M¨obius transformations in the complex plane are the complex map-
pings of the form7
w →αw + β
γw + δ
(12.36)
where αδ −βγ ̸= 0. It is usually assumed without loss of generality that
the complex numbers α, β, γ, δ satisfy
αδ −βγ = 1.
(12.37)
M¨obius transformations are the most general analytic transformations of
the Riemann sphere to itself. Using (12.35), we can rewrite (12.36) as
b
c →αb + βc
γb + δc .
(12.38)
The M¨obius transformation (12.38) does not depend on the particular
choice of b and c in the equivalence class [(b, c)], which allows us to view
the transformation as acting on CP1.
In Section 12.2, we gave an alternate, matrix description of CP1 as
CP1 = {X ∈C2×2 : X† = X, X2 = X}
(12.39)
7An excellent description of these transformations, and their relation to Lorentz trans-
formations, appears in §1.2 and §1.3 of [14].

Division Algebras in Mathematics

where X = vv† and v =

.
From this point of view, v is a spinor,
whose square X is a null vector. Using these various identiﬁcations, we can
rewrite a M¨obius transformation (12.36) as a map on spinors
v →Mv
(12.40)
where
M =

α β
γ δ

(12.41)
and, imposing the condition (12.37), we see that det M = 1.
We thus
see that M¨obius transformations are exactly the same as Lorentz trans-
formations. Note the key role played by associativity, which allows one to
multiply numerator and denominator of a M¨obius transformation by c, thus
permitting a reinterpretation as a matrix equation.
But we know how to implement Lorentz transformations over the oc-
tonions.
In Section 9.3, we presented generators for the Lorentz group,
originally given by Manogue and Schray [5], whose components lie in a sin-
gle complex subalgebra of O (which may diﬀer for diﬀerent generators), and
whose determinant is real. As discussed in Section 12.3, Such generators
also satisfy a compatibility condition, namely
(Mv)(Mv)† = M(vv†)M †
(12.42)
between the spinor (v) and vector (X = vv†) representations.
Putting this all together, we will invert the usual derivation that Lorentz
transformations are the same as M¨obius transformations. Rather, we will
deﬁne octonionic M¨obius transformations in terms of Lorentz transforma-
tions, and then show that these transformations can be rewritten in the
form (12.38).
Thus, given an octonion w, deﬁne (generators of) M¨obius transforma-
tions via (12.36), which we rewrite as
fM(w) = (αw + β)(γw + δ)−1
(12.43)
and where the matrix of coeﬃcients M deﬁned by (12.41) is now not only
octonionic, but is further required to be one of Manogue & Schray’s com-
patible generators of the Lorentz group.
We would like to be able to construct more general M¨obius transforma-
tions by nesting. However, it is not at all obvious that iterating (12.43) leads
to a (suitably nested) transformation of the same type. We would really like

118
The Geometry of the Octonions
to be able to use (an octonionic version of) (12.38) to deﬁne M¨obius trans-
formations, as this would make it apparent that iterating M¨obius trans-
formations corresponds directly to nesting Lorentz transformations.
As
previously noted, this construction requires (12.38) to be independent of
the particular choice of b and c. Remarkably, the octonionic generalization
of (12.38) does have this property, as we now show.
Suppose that
w = bc−1
(12.44)
where now b, c ∈O. Letting
v0 =
w
1

(12.45)
we have
v = v0c
(12.46)
and
vv† = |c|2v0v†
0
(12.47)
since only two octonionic directions are involved.
We now write
V = Mv =

(12.49)
and similar relations for V0 = Mv0. Compatibility now leads to
V V † = (Mv)(Mv)†
= M(vv†)M † = |c|2M(v0v†
0)M †
= |c|2(Mv0)(Mv0)† = |c|2V0V †

(12.50)
Comparing the oﬀdiagonal entries of (12.50), we obtain
|C|2BC−1 = |c|2|C0|2B0C−1
0 .
(12.51)
But direct computation shows that
|C|2 = |γb + δc|2 = |γw + δ|2|c|2 = |C0|2|c|2
(12.52)

119
provided
[b, c, γ] · δ = 0
(12.53)
where · denotes the inner product on O deﬁned in (4.25); this condition is
satisﬁed for compatible M since γ and δ lie in the same complex subspace
of O. Finally, by construction we have
fM(w) = B0C−1
0
(12.54)
and putting this all together results in
BC−1 = fM(w)
(12.55)
or equivalently
fM(w) = (αw + β)(γw + δ)−1 = (αb + βc)(γb + δc)−1.
(12.56)
This is the desired result, since b and c were arbitrary (satisfying (12.44)).
We have shown that the ﬁnite octonionic Lorentz transformations in ten
dimensions as given by Manogue & Schray [5] can be used to deﬁne octo-
nionic M¨obius transformations, thus recovering (and correcting) the earlier
results of D¨undarer, G¨ursey, & Tze [16, 17]. However, our approach dif-
fers signiﬁcantly from theirs, as theirs corresponds to using (12.36), while
ours uses (12.38). We have thus shown that octonionic M¨obius transfor-
mations extend to the octonionic projective space OP1, deﬁned by (12.2).
This description could be a key ingredient when attempting to generalize
4-dimensional twistor theory to ten dimensions. Much recent research in
superstrings, supergravity, and M-theory has emphasized the importance
of lightlike objects in ten dimensions. An appropriate octonionic general-
ization of twistor theory to ten dimensions might allow powerful twistor
techniques to be applied to these other theories.
A key role in our argument is the use of two fundamental properties of
the octonionic Lorentz transformations in [5], namely nesting and compati-
bility. Our results here support our view that these are essential features of
any computation involving octonions. Otherwise, repeated transformations
of the form (12.36) are not equivalent to those of the form (12.38), due to
the lack of associativity.
12.5
The Octonionic Projective Plane
In Section 12.2, we considered projective lines, which are equivalence classes
of points in K2.
Those equivalence classes, in turn, correspond to the

120
The Geometry of the Octonions
(normalized) “squares” (vv†) of the “points” (v).
Here, we extend the
discussion to projective planes, which are described in K3.
So what is a projective plane? Starting with R, we would like to deﬁne
an equivalence relation between points, of the form
(b, c, r) ∼(bχ, cχ, rχ)
(12.57)
where 0 ̸= χ ∈R. Again, it is more natural to consider squares of normal-
ized columns. If we normalize v ∈R3 by
v†v = 1
(12.58)
where we have again written † instead of T for transpose, then
(vv†)(vv†) = v(v†v)v† = vv†.
(12.59)
Thus, normalized column vectors v have matrix squares vv† that are pro-
jection operators, that is, which square to themselves. Thus, we deﬁne
RP2 = {X ∈H3(R) : X 2 = X, tr X = 1}
(12.60)
where again the trace condition guarantees that X = vv† for some v.
We expect this construction to go through for the other division alge-
bras, and it does, but there’s a catch.
Over C and H, everything goes
through as expected, yielding projective planes CP2 and HP2. What hap-
pens over O? The octonionic projective plane, discovered by Ruth Moufang
and known as the Cayley plane, is indeed deﬁned by
OP2 = {X ∈H3(O) : X 2 = X, tr X = 1}.
(12.61)
However, we used associativity in (12.59)! We must therefore ask, which
matrices in H3(O) square to themselves? The answer is a bit surprising.
Writing
X =


p a
c
a m b
c
b
n


(12.62)
and squaring, we see that, for instance, the (1, 3) component of X 2 = X
yields
(p + n)c + a b = c.
(12.63)
Since p, n ∈R, a, b, c must associate!
Thus, the components of matri-
ces in the Cayley plane must lie in a quaternionic subalgebra of O! The
components of diﬀerent matrices can of course lie in diﬀerent quaternionic

Division Algebras in Mathematics
121
subalgebras; nonetheless, this is a signiﬁcant restriction on the possible
matrices.
If we recall the deﬁnition of the Freudenthal product given in Sec-
tion 11.2, we see that
X ∗X = X 2 −X tr (X) + 1
2

tr (X)2 −tr (X 2)

(12.64)
so if X 2 = X and tr X = 1, we obtain
X ∗X = 0.
(12.65)
Conversely, if the Freudenthal square vanishes, then so does its trace
tr (X ∗X) = 1
2

tr (X 2) −tr (X)2
(12.66)
so that (12.65) reduces to
X 2 = Xtr (X).
(12.67)
Thus, points in the Cayley plane are precisely the normalized solutions
of (12.65), that is,
OP2 = {X ∈H3(O) : X ∗X = 0, tr X = 1}.
(12.68)
Furthermore, since the components of X ∈H3(O) lie in some quaternionic
subalgebra H ⊂O (which depends on X), simple linear algebra shows that
X = vv†
(12.69)
for some v ∈H3.
Thus, the elements of OP2 the squares of (quater-
nionic!) triples in O3.
Now that we know what the points in the projective plane are, we need
to ﬁnd the lines. We ﬁrst brieﬂy return to the real case. Let v, w ∈R3
be (real) vectors in three Euclidean dimensions. In Section 11.2, we intro-
duced the Jordan (◦) and Freudenthal (∗) products on the Albert algebra
of octonionic Hermitian 3 × 3 matrices. We can construct such matrices
from v and w, namely vvT and wwT . We than have the identities
(vvT ) ◦(wwT ) = (vT w)(vwT ) + (wT v)(wvT )
= (vT w)(vwT + wvT ),
(12.70)
tr (vvT ◦wwT ) = (vT w)2,
(12.71)
(vvT ) ∗(wwT ) = (v × w)(v × w)T ,
(12.72)
where v × w denotes the usual cross product in R3, and where of course
vT w = wT v ∈R. Equations (12.70)–(12.72) justify regarding the trace

122
The Geometry of the Octonions
of the Jordan product as a generalized dot product, and the Freudenthal
product as a generalized cross product.
Over C and H, (12.71) becomes
tr (vv† ◦ww†) = |v†w|2
(12.73)
since now v†w = w†v.
Continuing the analogy to vector analysis, a “vector” “cross” itself must
vanish. In fact, if we think of OP2 ⊗R as the space of (non-normalized)
“vectors”, henceforth called “1-squares”, so that
OP2 ⊗R = {X ∈H3(O) : X ∗X = 0}
(12.74)
then for A, B ∈OP2 ⊗R we have
A ∗B = 0 ⇐⇒B = λA
(12.75)
for some λ ∈R, so that A and B are “parallel”.
Similar analogies can be made with the dot product. In HP2 (and hence
also in RP2 and CP2),
tr (vv† ◦ww†) = 0 =⇒vv† ◦ww† = 0
(12.76)
which follows from (12.73). Remarkably, (12.76) still holds in OP2 even
though (12.73) does not, as can be checked by an explicit but lengthy
computation. That is,
tr (X ◦Y) = 0 =⇒X ◦Y = 0
(12.77)
for X, Y ∈OP2. An interesting consequence of (12.77) is that
X ∗X = 0 = tr X ⇐⇒X = 0.
(12.78)
Using our intuition about points and lines in the real projective plane,
our knowledge of vector analysis in R3, and our notions of generalized
dot and cross products, we are now ready to study the properties of the
octonionic projective plane.
So what are the lines in the projective plane? Recall that the points of
OP2 are given by (12.61). Consider by analogy the matrices
Λ = {X ∈H3(O) : X 2 = X, tr X = 2}
(12.79)
and call the elements of Λ lines.
Why is this terminology reasonable? In algebraic terms, P ∈OP2 is
a primitive idempotent of H3(O). Restricting temporarily to H to avoid
associativity issues, P is a projection operator on H3 into a 1-dimensional

Division Algebras in Mathematics
123
subspace, whereas L ∈Λ is a projection operator into a 2-dimensional sub-
space (and I “projects” into a 3-dimensional subspace, namely all of H3). In
the projective plane, (equivalence classes of) such 1-dimensional subspaces
are “points”, and (equivalence classes of) such 2-dimensional subspaces are
lines. The deﬁnitions (12.61) and (12.79) therefore represent plausible gen-
eralizations of these concepts to the nonassociative case.
Using deﬁnition (12.79), if Q ∈OP2 is a point, then
L = I −Q ∈Λ
(12.80)
is a line, where I is the 3 × 3 identity matrix, which is also the unique
matrix that squares to itself and has trace 3. There is thus a natural duality
relationship between the lines and points of OP2. Using our intuition from
R3, where there is a unique line (through the origin) perpendicular to each
plane (through the origin), and vice versa, we can use the point I−L, which
is “perpendicular” to L, to deﬁne the points P that are on the line L as
being those points which are orthogonal to I −L. What does orthogonality
mean for points? Use the trace of the Jordan product, that is, deﬁne P to
be on L if
tr ((I −L) ◦P) = 0.
(12.81)
Since P, I −L ∈OP2, we can use (12.77) to drop the trace; P is on L if
(I −L) ◦P = 0
(12.82)
or equivalently if
L ◦P = P.
(12.83)
What is the line determined by the points P and Q? Use the cross
product! If P, Q ∈OP2, then it does indeed follow that
(P ∗Q) ∗(P ∗Q) = 0
(12.84)
that is, P ∗Q is a 1-square if P and Q are 1-squares (and is nonzero so
long as P and Q are not “parallel”). However, P ∗Q will not in general be
normalized. The point “orthogonal” to P and Q is therefore P∗Q/tr (P∗Q),
so the line determined by P and Q must be8
LPQ = I −
P ∗Q
tr (P ∗Q).
(12.85)
8Some authors, such as Baez [18], consider lines to be given by P ∗Q, rather than by
expressions such as (12.85).

124
The Geometry of the Octonions
P and Q are on this line, since
(P ∗Q) ◦Q = 0
(12.86)
for any 1-squares P and Q. More generally, three points P, Q, and S are
collinear if
(P ∗Q) ◦S = 0.
(12.87)
Recall from Sections 11.2–11.4 that E6 acts on H3(O). We brieﬂy sum-
marize some properties of the induced action of E6 on OP2.
• The trace of the triple product is the polarization of the determi-
nant, and hence preserved by E6. Thus, E6 is precisely the sym-
metry group which preserves the notion of collinear points in OP2.
• In fact, E6 takes p-squares to p-squares, but the boosts in E6 do
not preserve the normalization condition on OP2. Thus, E6 takes
points to points, and lines to lines up to normalization (which can
be corrected by slightly modifying the action).
• The action of E6 on lines is not the usual action of E6 on 2-squares,
but rather the “squared” action induced by
P ∗Q −→(MPM†) ∗(MQM†),
with subsequent renormalization as needed.
• Since F4 is the automorphism group of the Jordan product, it is
also the automorphism group of the Freudenthal product, so that
(MPM†) ∗(MQM†) = M(P ∗Q)M†
(12.88)
for M ∈F4.
• The remaining elements (“boosts”) in E6 are generated by com-
plex Hermitian matrices, and for such matrices direct computation
shows that
(MPM†) ∗(MQM†) = (M ∗M)(P ∗Q)(M ∗M)†.
(12.89)
This operation yields a “dual” action of boosts on 1-squares, given
by M ∗M rather than M—and note that M ∗M is (a multiple
of) M−1; these boosts go “the other way”.
• Any projective line is a 2-square with repeated eigenvalue 1, and
can therefore be written (in several ways) as L = P + Q, where P,
Q are projective points satisfying P ◦Q = 0.
• But if P ◦Q = 0, the Freudenthal product simpliﬁes to
2 P ∗Q = I −P −Q.
(12.90)

Division Algebras in Mathematics
125
• Thus, a projective line can be written as L = I −2P ∗Q, where P
and Q are (“orthogonal”) points on the line.
• If L ∈Λ is a line in OP2, then the action of E6 is given by
L −→L′ =

I −M(I −L)M†
(rotations)
I −1
N (M ∗M)(I −L)(M ∗M)†
(boosts)
(12.91)
where N is a normalization constant.
• Untangling these deﬁnitions, the condition that a point A is on L
is preserved by boosts, since
(M ∗M)(I −L)(M ∗M)† = 2(M ∗M)(P ∗Q)(M ∗M)†
= 2(MPM†) ∗(MQM†)
(12.92)
and therefore
L′ ◦A′ = A′ ⇐⇒0 = (M ∗M)(I −L)(M ∗M)† ◦MAM†
= 2

(MPM†) ∗(MQM†)

◦MAM†
= 2(P ∗Q) ◦A
⇐⇒L ◦A = A.
(12.93)
• E6 is therefore the symmetry group which takes points to points
and lines to lines in OP2, while preserving the incidence relation.
12.6
Quaternionic Integers
What are integers? Over R, the answer is easy, namely the inﬁnite set
Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}.
(12.94)
It is straightforward to extend this deﬁnition to the complex numbers, re-
sulting in the Gaussian integers
Z[ℓ] = Z ⊕Zℓ= {m + nℓ: m, n ∈Z}.
(12.95)
where we continue to use ℓrather than i for the complex unit. The Gaussian
integers form a lattice in two dimensions. The units of Z[ℓ] are the elements
with norm one, namely the set {±1, ±ℓ}.
What happens over the other division algebras?
We can of course simply extend the construction of the Gaussian inte-
gers. Over H, we obtain the Lipschitz integers
Z[i, j, k] = Z ⊕Zi ⊕Zj ⊕Zk
(12.96)

126
The Geometry of the Octonions
with units {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k}. As with both the ordinary integers and the
Gaussian integers, the Lipschitz integers are clearly closed under multi-
plication, and the norm of a Gaussian integer is an (ordinary) integer.
Remarkably, the Gaussian integers are not the only subalgebra of H with
these properties.
Consider
q = 1
2(1 + i + j + k) ∈H
(12.97)
which has the surprising property that
|q| = 1
4 + 1
4 + 1
4 + 1
4 = 1 ∈Z
(12.98)
so that the norm of q is an integer, even though the components of q are not.
Such “half-integer” quaternions do not quite close under multiplication,
since for instance
1
2(1 + i + j + k)
 1
2(1 −i + j + k)

= k
(12.99)
which has integer coeﬃcients rather than half-integer. But the union of the
“half-integer” quaternions with the “integer” quaternions, that is, with the
Lipschitz integers, does close under multiplication. The elements of this
union are called Hurwitz integral quaternions, or simply Hurwitz integers,
and can be generated by {q, i, j, k}, that is, any Hurwitz integer can be
written as a product of these four generators. The units among the Hur-
witz integers are {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k, 1
2(±1 ± i ± j ± k)}, where all possible
combinations of signs are permitted in the last element. As the subalgebra
consisting of all rational quaternions with integer norm, there are contexts
in which the Hurwitz integers, rather than the Lipschitz integers, play the
role of “quaternionic integers”.
Why did we add the qualiﬁer “rational”? There are of course other
elements of H and C with unit norm. For instance, the cube roots of unity
over C, which are {1, 1
2(−1 ±
√
3ℓ)}, not only have unit norm but form a
subalgebra of C, that is, they close under multiplication. We could therefore
have considered the Eisenstein integers {m + n 1
2(−1 +
√
3ℓ)}, which are
also called Euler integers. However, the unit elements ±ℓare not Eisenstein
integers—hence the restriction to rational coeﬃcients.
A remarkable property of the Hurwitz integers is that they contain
rational cube (and sixth) roots of unity. Because
q3 = −1
(12.100)

Division Algebras in Mathematics
127
the Hurwitz integer
−q2 = 1
2(1 −k −j −k)
(12.101)
is a rational cube root of unity.
Further discussion of integral quaternions can be found in [19].
12.7
Octonionic Integers
What are the octonionic integers? Based on our discussion of the quater-
nionic case in Section 12.6, we require the components of any such octonion
to be either an integer or a half-integer, and the norm of any such octonion
to be an integer. How many elements of this form are there?
First of all, we have the 16 elements
G = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k, ±kℓ, ±jℓ, ±iℓ, ±ℓ}.
(12.102)
These
16
elements
close
under
multiplication,
and
generate
an
8-dimensional lattice which we will call the Gravesian integers, and which
generalize the Lipschitz integers over H.9 However, as is the case over H,
the Gravesian integers are not maximal.
Next, we can consider the 28 elements
Ω=
1
2(±1 ± i ± j ± k ± kℓ± jℓ± iℓ± ℓ)

(12.103)
where all combinations of signs are allowed. Remarkably, products of ele-
ments in Ωeither have integer coeﬃcients, such as
1
2(1 + i + j + k + kℓ+ jℓ+ iℓ+ ℓ)
× 1
2(1 + i + j + k + kℓ+ jℓ+ iℓ−ℓ)
= −1 + i + j + k
(12.104)
or have eight (nonzero) half-integer coeﬃcients, such as
1
2(1 + i + j + k + kℓ+ jℓ+ iℓ+ ℓ)
× 1
2(1 −i −j + k + kℓ+ jℓ+ iℓ+ ℓ)
= 1
2(−1 + i −j + k + kℓ+ 3jℓ+ iℓ−ℓ)
= jℓ+ 1
2(−1 + i −j + k + kℓ+ jℓ+ iℓ−ℓ).
(12.105)
9Our terminology for the various sets of integral octonions is adapted from [19].

128
The Geometry of the Octonions
Thus, the 8-dimensional lattice generated by G ∪Ω, that is, the set of all
integer linear combinations of elements in G ∪Ω, also closes under multi-
plication; these are the Kleinian integers. However, the Kleinian integers
are also not maximal.
What happened to the Hurwitz integers? Surely we should include ele-
ments such as q = 1
2(1+i+j+k) and, once we do so, also the “complement”
of such elements, such as 1
2(kℓ+ jℓ+ iℓ+ ℓ). There’s only one problem:
The set generated by the 2 × 7 × 24 = 224 such elements, together with
G and Ω, collectively known as the Kirmse integers, doesn’t close under
multiplication! For example,
1
2(1 + i + j + k) × 1
2(1 + k + kℓ+ ℓ) = 1
2(i + k + kℓ+ jℓ)
(12.106)
which has not yet been included (since the complement of {i, k, kℓ, jℓ} is
{1, j, iℓ, ℓ}, which does not correspond to a quaternionic subalgebra of O).
Even if we include such elements, expanding our 224 Kirmse units to a set
of
8
4

× 24 = 1120 units, the product still doesn’t close. For example,
1
2(i + k + kℓ+ jℓ) × 1
2(1 + i + jℓ+ kℓ)
= 1
4(−3 + i + j + k + kℓ+ jℓ+ kℓ−ℓ)
(12.107)
which is clearly not in our pool of candidate integral octonions.
So how do we generalize the Hurwitz integers? Let’s start again. Recall
that the Hurwitz units over H are
H = {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k, 1
2(±1 ± i ± j ± k)}.
(12.108)
If we now include the Gravesian units, we can generate the complement of
H as Hℓ, and the Kleinian elements Ωas H ⊕Hℓ. The algebra generated
by H ∪G∪Ωcloses, since all products that don’t involve Ωlie entirely in H
or H⊥. We will refer to this algebra as the double Hurwitzian integers gen-
erated by H. Any of the other six quaternionic triples can be used in place
of {i, j, k}; there are seven diﬀerent copies of the double Hurwitzian integers
in O. However, the double Hurwitzian integers are still not maximal.
As discussed in [19], the trick to obtaining a maximal set of integral
octonions is to choose a preferred octonionic unit; we choose ℓ. Looking
at the octonionic multiplication table, there are three quaternionic triples
containing ℓ, so include the Hurwitz integers corresponding to those three
quaternionic subalgebras, but not those corresponding to the other four
quaternionic subalgebras. As before, include their complements—which can

Division Algebras in Mathematics
129
also be obtained as sums and diﬀerences of Hurwitz integers from diﬀerent
quaternionic subalgebras. We’re almost there. Computing products, we
discover that we have generated a diﬀerent set of 224 “generalized Kirmse
units”, namely
Ω0 =
1
2(±1 ± i ± iℓ± ℓ), 1
2(±1 ± j ± jℓ± ℓ), 1
2(±1 ± k ± kℓ± ℓ),
1
2(±j ± jℓ± k ± kℓ), 1
2(±k ± kℓ± i ± iℓ), 1
2(±i ± iℓ± j ± jℓ),
1
2(±1 ± iℓ± j ± k), 1
2(±1 ± i ± jℓ± k), 1
2(±1 ± i ± j ± kℓ),
1
2(±i ± jℓ± kℓ± ℓ), 1
2(±iℓ± j ± kℓ± ℓ), 1
2(±iℓ± jℓ± k ± ℓ),
1
2(±1 ± iℓ± jℓ± kℓ), 1
2(±i ± j ± k ± ℓ)

.
(12.109)
Remarkably, the lattice generated by G ∪Ω∪Ω0 does close under multi-
plication; we call its elements the “ℓ-integers”. There are 224 + 16 = 240
units in the ℓ-integers, since the elements of Ωare sums of elements of Ω0
(and are not units anyway). Furthermore, the ℓ-integers are maximal; no
further elements can be added without giving up either closure under mul-
tiplication or our deﬁning properties for candidate integers (namely integer
norm and half-integer or integer coeﬃcients).
This construction can of course be repeated replacing ℓwith any other
imaginary octonionic unit; there are thus seven diﬀerent maximal “orders”
of integral octonions.
Further information about integral octonions can be found in [19].
12.8
The Geometry of the e8 Lattice
The octonionic integers provide a natural description of the e8 lattice, as
we now show.
Recall from Section 10.3 that a simple Lie algebra of dimension d and
rank r contains a Cartan subalgebra of dimension r, consisting of mutually
consisting elements. Over C, the remaining d−r elements can be chosen to
be simultaneous eigenvectors of Cartan elements, with real eigenvalues; the
resulting r-tuples form the root diagram of the Lie algebra, which generates
a lattice.
It is intriguing that the root diagram of e8, and the corresponding lat-
tice, being 8-dimensional, can be represented using octonions. Since the

130
The Geometry of the Octonions
dimension of e8 is 248, and the rank is 8, the root diagram has 240 ele-
ments.
One representation of the e8 lattice is obtained by ﬁrst considering the
28 = 256 elements in Ω(see (12.103)). Clearly, half of these elements have
an even number of minus signs; call the collection of such elements Ω+.
We next consider g1 + g2 for pairs of elements g1, g2 ∈G (see (12.102))
that satisfy g1 ̸= ±g2; there are
8
2

× 22 = 112 such elements, which we
collectively call G0. Then the root diagram of e8 can be given by Ω+ ∪G0,
which generates the odd e8 lattice, which we will call L, following [20]. The
conjugate lattice R = L yields another representation of the e8 lattice.
A somewhat diﬀerent representation of the e8 lattice is obtained by
considering the union of the Hurwitz integers corresponding to all seven
quaternionic triples, as well as their complements, namely the 224 Kirmse
integers, together with the 16 elements of G. This construction yields a
third copy of the e8 root diagram; the corresponding lattice is the even e8
lattice, denoted B.
None of the lattices L, R, B closes under multiplication. However, each
of these lattices is closely related to integral octonions! For instance, choose
an octonion (ℓ) to be special, deﬁne
a = 1
2(1 + ℓ)
(12.110)
and denote the ℓ-integers of Section 12.7 by A. Then
A = aL = Ra = 2aBa
(12.111)
so that
L = 2aA = 2aA,
(12.112)
R = 2Aa = 2Aa,
(12.113)
B = La = aR = 2aAa,
(12.114)
where we have used the fact that a = 2a2a, with 2a2 = ℓ∈A. As discussed
by Wilson [20], the Moufang identities now imply that
BL = L,
(12.115)
RB = R,
(12.116)
LR = 2B.
(12.117)
Thus, the e8 lattice has the remarkable property that it can (also) be rep-
resented as an integral subalgebra of O, namely A.
Analogous descriptions exist for the other division algebras.
The
(rescaled) root diagram of a1 = su(2) consists of the two real numbers ±1,

Division Algebras in Mathematics
131
which is clearly closed under multiplication. The (rescaled) root diagram
of a2 = su(3) is a hexagon, which can be represented as the complex sixth
roots of unity—which is again closed under multiplication. Finally, the root
diagram of d4 = so(8) is normally given as the
4
2

× 22 = 24 quaternionic
vectors in G0, but a simple rotation (and renormalization) turns this into
a copy of the Hurwitz integers—which are the rational quaternionic sixth
roots of unity.
Further information about using octonions to describe the e8 lattice can
be found in [20].

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
13.1
The Eigenvalue Problem
The eigenvalue problem as usually stated is to ﬁnd eigenvectors v ̸= 0 and
eigenvalues λ that satisfy
Av = λv
(13.1)
for a given square matrix A, which we will assume to be complex and
Hermitian (A† = A). The basic properties of the eigenvalue problem for
such matrices are well-understood:
(1) The eigenvalues of complex Hermitian matrices are real.
(2) Eigenvectors of a complex Hermitian matrix corresponding to diﬀerent
eigenvalues are orthogonal.
(3) The eigenvectors of any complex Hermitian matrix (can be chosen to)
form an orthonormal basis.
(4) Any complex Hermitian matrix admits a decomposition in terms of an
orthonormal basis of eigenvectors.
Property 1 follows by computing
λv†v = (Av)†v = v†Av = λv†v
(13.2)
so that if v ̸= 0 we have 0 ̸= v†v ∈R, which forces λ = λ. Property 2
follows by considering eigenvectors vm with eigenvalues λm. By Property 1,
λm ∈R. Then
λ1v†
1v2 = (Av1)†v2 = v†
1Av2 = λ2v†
1v2
(13.3)
so if λ1 ̸= λ2 we must have v†
1v2 = 0, which deﬁnes orthogonality.
133

134
The Geometry of the Octonions
Property 3 follows from the previous properties using the additional fact
that there are exactly the right number of independent eigenvectors to form
a basis, which we will not prove.1 Property 4 is the statement that A can
be expanded as
A =
n

m=1
λmvmv†
m
(13.4)
where {vm} is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors corresponding to the
eigenvalues λm, that is, where
Avm = λmvm,
(13.5)
v†
mvn = δmn,
(13.6)
where δmn is the Kronecker delta. This expansion follows from the other
properties by checking that

n

m=1
λmvmv†
m

vk = λkvk.
(13.7)
Which of these properties, if any, hold over the other division algebras?
Over the quaternions, there are Hermitian matrices which admit non-
real eigenvalues. For instance, we have
0 −i
i
0
 1
k

=
j
i

= j
1
k

.
(13.8)
What went wrong? The proof of Property 1 uses commutativity to move
the eigenvalue λ around; this is no longer valid. Is there a way around this?
A bit of thought reveals that (13.1) is no longer the only eigenvalue
equation. The right eigenvalue problem turns out to be, well, the right
eigenvalue problem, that is
Av = vλ.
(13.9)
If the quaternionic matrix A is Hermitian, careful computation shows that
λ(v†v) = (λv†)v = (Av)†v = (v†A)v
= v†(Av) = v†(vλ) = (v†v)λ
(13.10)
which uses associativity, but not commutativity. Since v†v ∈R, we can
still conclude that λ ∈R. Similarly, orthogonality follows from
λ1(v†
1v2) = (λ1v†
1)v2 = (Av1)†v2 = (v†
1A)v2
= v†
1(Av2) = v†
1(v2λ2) = (v†
1v2)λ2
(13.11)
(and the fact that λm ∈R). Properties 1–4 therefore hold over the quater-
nions, so long as the eigenvalues are written on the right, as in (13.9). What
happens over the octonions?
1The Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization process can be used on any eigenspace corre-
sponding to an eigenvalue with multiplicity greater than one.

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
135
The use of associativity in the last two derivations leads one to sus-
pect that something will go wrong. It does; even the right eigenvalues of
octonionic Hermitian matrices need not be real. For instance, we have
0 −i
i
0
 j
ℓ

=
−iℓ
k

=
j
ℓ

kℓ.
(13.12)
Nevertheless, it turns out that there is a sense in which all of Properties 1–4
hold over the octonions, at least for 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 octonionic Hermitian
matrices [21]. We discuss each of these cases in turn.
13.2
The 2 × 2 Real Eigenvalue Problem
We consider the eigenvector problem Av = vλ over O, and look (only) for
solutions with real eigenvalues, that is, where λ ∈R.
There are no surprises in this case, or rather the only surprise is that
we cannot show that λ is real, but must assume this property separately.
First of all, there is only one independent octonion in A; the components
of A live in a complex subalgebra C ⊂O. We can write
A =
p a
a m

(13.13)
with a ∈C, p, m ∈R, and we will assume a ̸= 0. Setting
v =
x
y

(13.14)
with x, y ∈O brings the eigenvalue equation to the form
px + ay = λx,
(13.15)
ax + my = λy,
(13.16)
either of which suﬃces to show that a, x, y associate, and therefore lie in
some quaternionic subalgebra H ⊂O. So at ﬁrst sight, the eigenvalue prob-
lem for 2 × 2 octonionic Hermitian matrices with real eigenvalues reduces
to the quaternionic case.
Not so fast. Each eigenvector must indeed be quaternionic in the sense
above, but diﬀerent eigenvectors can, together with A, determine diﬀerent
quaternionic subalgebras.
Let’s try again. Since A is complex, we can start by solving the complex
eigenvalue problem, which allows us to write
A = λ1v1v†
1 + λ2v2v†
2
(13.17)

136
The Geometry of the Octonions
where the λm are real, and where the components of both A and the vm
all lie in C. If we now set
wm = vmξm
(13.18)
for any octonions ξm ∈O, it’s clear that wm is still an eigenvector of A with
eigenvalue λm; there are no associativity issues here, since A and (a single)
ξm determine (at most) a quaternionic subalgebra of O. Furthermore, if we
normalize the ξm by setting
|ξm| = 1
(13.19)
then we can replace vm by wm in (13.17) without changing anything.
We claim that all eigenvectors v of A have the form (13.18). One way
to see this is to note that, over H, we can make at least one component of v
real by right-multiplying by a suitable (quaternionic) phase, which does not
otherwise aﬀect the eigenvalue equation. But the eigenvalue equation then
forces the other component to lie in C, not merely in H. Thus, the result
of multiplying v by this phase is one of the complex eigenvectors of A.
Reversing this process establishes the claim.
It is instructive to work out these properties using explicit components.
From (13.15) and (13.16) we obtain
(λ −p)(λ −m)x = a(λ −m)y = a(ax) = |a|2x
(13.20)
where we have used the fact that p, m, λ ∈R, so that

(λ −p)(λ −m) −|a|2
x = 0.
(13.21)
Assuming x ̸= 0 (if not, start over with y), we recover the usual character-
istic equation
det(A −λI) = 0
(13.22)
for the eigenvalues of A. The rest is easy; at least one of (13.15) and (13.16)
determines y in terms of x. None of these manipulations use either com-
mutativity or associativity, although alternativity is required in the last
equality of (13.20).
Putting this all together, the eigenvectors of the 2 × 2 octonionic Her-
mitian matrix (13.13) with eigenvalue λ can be given in either of the forms
v =

|a|2
a(λ −p)

ξ,
v =
a(λ −m)
|a|2

ξ
(13.23)
where of course λ must solve (13.22).

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
137
There is however one last surprise. Associativity hasn’t been a problem
yet, since a single eigenvector involves only a and ξ, and hence has compo-
nents that live in a quaternionic subalgebra of O. So if vm are the complex
eigenvectors of A corresponding to eigenvalues λm, with m = 1, 2, then of
course
v†
1v2 = 0
(13.24)
that is, v1 is orthogonal to v2. However, with wm as in (13.18), we have
w†
1w2 = (v1ξ1)†(v2ξ2) = (ξ1v†
1)(v2ξ2)
(13.25)
which is not necessarily zero, since we cannot in general move the paren-
theses. A simple counterexample can be constructed using
v1 =
1
i

,
v2 =
 1
−i

,
(13.26)
and setting ξ1 = j, ξ2 = ℓ. So what does orthogonality mean?
The answer is both simple and elegant, and can be motivated by looking
again at (13.17), in which we can use either vm or wm (assuming that
|ξm| = 1). Why? Because ξm cancels out in the square! This suggests that
the correct notion of orthogonality is given by
v ⊥w ⇐⇒(vv†)w = 0
(13.27)
and it is easy to see that this notion of orthogonality does indeed hold
between any two eigenvectors of A with diﬀerent eigenvalues. In the asso-
ciative case, we can move the parentheses in (13.27), but not in general.
Further details can be found in [21].
13.3
The 2 × 2 Non-real Eigenvalue Problem2
The general 2 × 2 octonionic Hermitian matrix can be written as (13.13)
with p, m ∈R and a ∈O, and satisﬁes its characteristic equation (13.22),
which can be written as
A2 −(tr A) A + (det A) I = 0
(13.28)
where tr A = p + m denotes the trace of A, and where there is no diﬃculty
in deﬁning the determinant of A as usual via
det A = pm −|a|2
(13.29)
since the components of A lie in a complex subalgebra C ⊂O. If a = 0 the
eigenvalue problem is trivial, so we assume a ̸= 0. We also write v in the
form (13.14), with x, y ∈O.

13.3.1
Left Eigenvalue Problem
As pointed out in Section 13.1, even quaternionic Hermitian matrices can
admit left eigenvalues which are not real, as is shown by the following
example:

1 −i
i
1
 
1
k

=

1 + j
k + i

= (1 + j)

1
k

.
(13.30)
Direct computation allows us to determine which Hermitian matrices A
admit left eigenvalues which are not real. Inserting (13.14) into the left
eigenvalue equation (13.1) leads to
(λ −p)x = ay,
(λ −m)y = ax,
(13.31)
which in turn leads to
a

(λ −p)x

|a|2
= y = (λ −m)(ax)
|λ −m|2
.
(13.32)
Assuming without loss of generality that x ̸= 0 and taking the norm of
both sides yields
|a|2 = |λ −p||λ −m|
(13.33)
resulting in
a

(λ −p)x

|λ −p|
= (λ −m)(ax)
|λ −m|
.
(13.34)
This equation splits into two independent parts, the terms (in the numera-
tor) which involve the imaginary part of λ, which is nonzero by assumption,3
and those which don’t. Looking ﬁrst at the latter leads to
p = m
(13.35)
which in turn reduces (13.34) to
a(λx) = λ(ax)
(13.36)
which forces a to be purely imaginary (and orthogonal to λ), but which
puts no conditions on x.
Denoting the 2 × 2 identity matrix by I, setting
J(r) =

0 −r
r
0

(13.37)
3We assume without loss of generality that Re (λ) = 0 by replacing A with A−Re (λ)I.

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
139
and noting that r is a pure imaginary unit octonion if and only if r2 = −1,
we have:
Lemma 13.1. The set of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices A for which non-real
left eigenvalues exist is
A2 = {A = p I + q J(r); p, q ∈R, q ̸= 0, r2 = −1}.
(13.38)
The set A2 has some remarkable properties, which will be further dis-
cussed below. Without loss of generality, we can take r = i, so that A takes
the form
A =

p −iq
iq
p

.
(13.39)
Let us ﬁnd the general solution of the left eigenvalue problem for these
matrices. Taking A as in (13.39) and v as in (13.14), the left eigenvalue
equation becomes
λ −p
q
x = −iy,
(13.40)
λ −p
q
y = ix.
(13.41)
Taking the norm of both sides immediately yields
|x|2 = |y|2
(13.42)
and we can normalize both of these to 1 without loss of generality. We thus
obtain
λ −p
q
= −(iy)x = (ix)y
= −[i, y, x] −i(yx) = [i, x, y] + i(xy).
(13.43)
But since
[z, y, x] = −[z, y, x] = [z, x, y] = −[z, x, y]
(13.44)
for any z, the two associators are equal, and we are left with
x · y = xy + yx = 0.
(13.45)
Thus, x and y correspond to orthonormal vectors in O thought of as R8.
This argument is fully reversible; any suitably normalized x and y which
are orthogonal yield an eigenvector of A. We have therefore shown that all
matrices in A2 have the same left eigenvectors:
Lemma 13.2. The set of left eigenvectors for any matrix A ∈A2 is
V2 =
x
y

: |x|2 = |y|2; x · y = 0

.
(13.46)

140
The Geometry of the Octonions
Given x and y, the left eigenvalue is given in each case by either (13.40)
or (13.41). Furthermore, left multiplication by an arbitrary octonion pre-
serves the set V2, so that matrices in A2 have the property that left mul-
tiplication of left eigenvectors yields another left eigenvector (albeit with a
diﬀerent eigenvalue).4 It follows from (13.40) or (13.41) and (13.42) that
|λ −p| = q.
(13.47)
Inserting (13.47) into either (13.40) or (13.41), multiplying both sides by i,
and using the identities
a · (xb) = b · (xa),
(13.48)
(ax) · (bx) = |x|2 a · b,
(13.49)
for any a, b, x ∈O (where · denotes the inner product on O deﬁned
in (4.25)), then shows that (13.45) forces λ · i = 0, or more generally
λ · a = 0.
(13.50)
However, (13.47) and (13.50) are the only restrictions on λ, in the sense
that (13.40) or (13.41) can be used to construct eigenvectors having any
eigenvalue satisfying these two conditions.
13.3.2
Right Eigenvalue Problem
As discussed in Section 13.1, the right eigenvalues of quaternionic Hermitian
matrices must be real, which is a strong argument in favor of putting the
eigenvalues on the right. However, as also pointed out Section 13.1, there
do exist octonionic Hermitian matrices which admit right eigenvalues which
are not real, as is shown by the following example:

1 −i
i
1
 
j
ℓ

=

j −iℓ
ℓ+ k

=

j
ℓ

(1 + kℓ).
(13.51)
Proceeding as we did for left eigenvectors, we can determine which ma-
trices A admit right eigenvalues which are not real. Inserting (13.14) into
the right eigenvalue equation leads to
x(λ −p) = ay,
y(λ −m) = ax,
(13.52)
which in turn leads to
a

x(λ −p)

|a|2
= y = (ax)(λ −m)
|λ −m|2
.
(13.53)
4Direct computation shows that, other than real matrices, the matrices in A2 are the
only 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices with this property.

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
141
Taking the norm of both sides (and assuming x ̸= 0) again yields (13.33),
resulting in
a

x(λ −p)

|λ −p|
= (ax)(λ −m)
|λ −m|
.
(13.54)
Just as for the left eigenvector problem, this equation splits into two inde-
pendent parts, the terms (in the numerator) which involve the imaginary
part of λ, which is nonzero by assumption, and those which don’t. Looking
ﬁrst at the latter again forces p = m, which in turn forces |y| = |x|. The
remaining condition is now
a(xλ) = (ax)λ
(13.55)
so that a, Im (λ), and x antiassociate. In particular, this forces both a and
x to be pure imaginary, as well as
λ · a = 0,
(13.56)
λ · x = 0 = a · x,
(13.57)
with corresponding identities also holding for y.5 But (13.56) and (13.57)
are conditions on λ and v, not on A. We conclude that the necessary and
suﬃcient condition for matrices to admit non-real right eigenvalues real is
that A ∈A2:
Lemma 13.3. The set of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices A for which non-real
right eigenvalues is A2 as deﬁned in (13.38).
Thus, all 2×2 Hermitian matrices which admit non-real right eigenvalues
also admit non-real left eigenvalues, and vice versa!
Corollary 13.1. A 2 × 2 octonionic Hermitian matrix admits right eigen-
values which are not real if and only if it admits left eigenvalues which are
not real.
Turning to the eigenvectors, inserting p = m into (13.52) leads to
x(ay) = y(ax)
(13.58)
and inserting the conditions on a, x, and y now leads to
x · y = 0
(13.59)
5This also implies that aλ · x = 0, that is, x (and y) must be orthogonal to the
quaternionic subalgebra generated by λ and a.

142
The Geometry of the Octonions
just as for left eigenvectors. All right eigenvectors with non-real eigenvalues
are hence in V2, although the converse is false (since right eigenvectors have
no real part). Furthermore, not all of the remaining elements of V2 will
be eigenvectors for any given matrix A (since right eigenvectors have no
“quaternionic” part).
Putting all of this together, typical solutions of the (right) eigenvalue
problem for A as in (13.39) can thus be written as
v = n
 j
ks

,
λv = p + qs,
(13.60)
w = n
ks
j

,
λw = p −qs,
(13.61)
where p, q, n ∈R and where
s = cos θ + kℓsin θ.
(13.62)
The example given in (13.51) is a special case of the ﬁrst of (13.61) with
p = q = n = 1 and θ = π/2.
13.3.3
Further Properties
We list some further properties of the 2 × 2 non-real eigenvalue problem
without proof. For further details, see [22].
• The eigenvalues of the right eigenvalue problem satisfy the character-
istic equation
λ2 −λ(tr A) + (det A) = [a, x, y] (λ −p)
|y|2
= [a, y, x] (λ −m)
|x|2
. (13.63)
If the associator [a, x, y] vanishes, then λ satisﬁes the ordinary charac-
teristic equation, and hence is real (since A is complex Hermitian). Other-
wise, comparing real and imaginary parts of the last two terms in (13.63)
provides an alternate derivation of |y| = |x|, and we recover p = m as ex-
pected. Furthermore, since the left-hand side of (13.63) lies in a complex
subalgebra of O, so does the right-hand side, and it is then straightforward
to solve for λ by considering its real and imaginary parts. The generalized
characteristic equation (13.63) then yields the following equation for λ
(Re (λ))2 −Re (λ)(tr A) + (det A) = (Im (λ))2 < 0
(13.64)
together with the requirement that
[a, x, y]
|x||y|
= 2 Im (λ).
(13.65)

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
143
The explicit form of the eigenvalues given in (13.61) and (13.62) veriﬁes
that there are no further restrictions on λ other than (13.56) and (13.64).
Furthermore, having shown in the previous subsection that a and x (and
therefore also y) are pure imaginary, (13.65) yields an alternate derivation
that λ is orthogonal to a, which is (13.56) as well as to x and y, which
is (13.57).
• If Av = λvv with v†v = 1 and [a, x, y] = 0, then
A = λvvv† + λwww†
(13.66)
where
w =
0 1
1 0

v =
y
x

∈V2
(13.67)
and where λv = λ is obtained by solving (13.40) or (13.41), and λw is
obtained from λv by interchanging x and y.
We illustrate this result by returning to the example (13.30), for which
we obtain the decomposition

1 −i

(13.68)
where the factor of two is due to the normalization of the eigenvectors.
The above construction fails if [i, x, y] ̸= 0.
• Any A ∈A2 with (normalized) v ∈V2 such that Av = vλv can be
expanded as
A = λv (vv†) + λw (ww†)
(13.69)
where w is deﬁned by (13.67) and satisﬁes Aw = wλw.
As before, we can assume without loss of generality that A is given
by (13.39) and that v and w are given by (13.61). Returning to our exam-
ple (13.51) yields the explicit decomposition

(13.70)
While it is true that
(vv†) w = v (v†w)
(13.71)
for any v, w related by (13.67) (but not necessarily in V2), the decomposi-
tion (13.69) is surprising because the eigenvalues λv, λw do not commute

here, we have

λv(vv†)

w ̸= 0.
(13.72)
• Any A ∈A2 with (normalized) v ∈V2 such that Av = vλv can be
expanded as
A = (vλv) v† + (wλw) w†
(13.73)
where w is deﬁned by (13.67) and satisﬁes Aw = wλw.
The decomposition (13.73) is less surprising than (13.69) when one re-
alizes that orthogonality in the form

(13.74)
holds for any λ ∈O and v, w ∈V2 satisfying (13.67).
13.4
The 3 × 3 Real Eigenvalue Problem6
We now turn to the 3 × 3 case. It is not immediately obvious that 3 × 3
octonionic Hermitian matrices have a well-deﬁned characteristic equation.
We therefore ﬁrst review some of the properties of these matrices before
turning to the eigenvalue problem. As in the 2 × 2 case, over the octonions
there will be solutions of the eigenvalue problem with eigenvalues which are
not real; we consider here only the real eigenvalue problem.
Recall from Section 11.2 that the 3 × 3 octonionic Hermitian matrices,
which we call Jordan matrices, form the exceptional Jordan algebra, also
known as the Albert algebra, under the Jordan product.
Remarkably, Jordan matrices satisfy the usual characteristic equa-
tion [13]
A3 −(tr A) A2 + σ(A) A −(det A) I = 0
(13.75)
where σ(A) is deﬁned by
σ(A) = 1
2

(tr A)2 −tr (A2)

= tr (A ∗A)
(13.76)
and where the determinant of A was deﬁned abstractly in terms of the
Jordan and Freudenthal products in Section 11.2. Concretely, if
A =


p a

with p, m, n ∈R and a, b, c ∈O then
tr A = p + m + n,
(13.78)
σ(A) = pm + pn + mn −|a|2 −|b|2 −|c|2,
(13.79)
det A = pmn + b(ac) + b(ac) −n|a|2 −m|b|2 −p|c|2.
(13.80)
An n × n Hermitian matrix over any of the normed division algebras
can be rewritten as a symmetric kn × kn real matrix, where k denotes the
dimension of the underlying division algebra. It is therefore clear that a
3×3 octonionic Hermitian matrix must have 8×3 = 24 real eigenvalues [23].
However, as we now show, instead of having (a maximum of) three distinct
real eigenvalues, each with multiplicity eight, we show that there are (a
maximum of) six distinct real eigenvalues, each with multiplicity four.
The reason for this peculiar property is that, somewhat surprisingly,
a (real) eigenvalue λ of a Jordan matrix A does not in general satisfy
the characteristic equation (13.75).7
To see this, consider the ordinary
eigenvalue equation
Av = λv
(13.81)
with A as in (13.77), λ ∈R, and where
v =


x
y
z

.
(13.82)
Explicit computation yields
(λ −p)x = ay + bz,
(13.83)
(λ −m)y = cz + ax,
(13.84)
(λ −n)z = bx + cy,
(13.85)
so that
(λ −p)(λ −m)y = (λ −p)(cz + ax) = (λ −p)cz + a(ay + bz)
(13.86)
which implies

(λ −p)(λ −m) −|a|2
y = a(bz) + (λ −p)cz.
(13.87)
7Ogievetski˘ı [24] constructed a 6th order polynomial satisﬁed by the real eigenvalues,
which he called the characteristic equation. This polynomial is presumably equivalent
to the modiﬁed characteristic equations (for both values of r) given below.

146
The Geometry of the Octonions
Assume ﬁrst that λ ̸= p. Using (13.83) and (13.87) in (13.85) leads to

(13.89)
Now consider the case λ = p. We still have (13.87), which here takes the
form
−|a|2y = a(bz).
(13.90)
Inserting (13.90) into (13.84), we can solve for x, obtaining
−|a|2x = a(cz) + (p −m)bz.
(13.91)
Finally, inserting (13.90) and (13.91) in (13.85) yields
−

|a|2(p −n) + |b|2(p −m)

z = b(a(cz)) + c

a(bz)

.
(13.92)
Comparing with (13.78)–(13.80) and using λ = p, we see that (13.89) still
holds, and thus holds in general.
If a, b, c, and z associate, the right-hand side of (13.89) vanishes, and λ
does indeed satisfy the characteristic equation (13.75); this will not happen
in general. However, since the left-hand side of (13.89) is a real multiple
of z, this must also be true of the right-hand side, so that

Lemma 13.4. The real eigenvalues of the 3 × 3 octonionic Hermitian ma-
trix A satisfy the modiﬁed characteristic equation
det(λI −A) = λ3 −(tr A) λ2 + σ(A) λ −det A = r

147
where r is either of the two roots of
r2 + 4Φ(a, b, c) r −|[a, b, c]|2 = 0
(13.95)
with a, b, c as deﬁned by (13.77) and where
Φ(a, b, c) = 1
2 Re ([a, b]c).
(13.96)
Proof. These results were obtained using Mathematica to solve (13.93) by
brute force for real r and octonionic z given generic octonions a, b, c [25].
Furthermore, provided that [a, b, c] ̸= 0, each of x, y, and z can be shown
to admit an expansion in terms of four real parameters.
Corollary 13.2. With A and r as above, and assuming [a, b, c] ̸= 0,
z = (αa + βb + γc + δ)

1 + [a, b, c] r
|[a, b, c]|2

(13.97)
with α, β, γ, δ ∈R. Similar expansions hold for x and y.
The real parameters α, β, γ, δ may be freely speciﬁed for one (nonzero)
component, say z; the remaining components x, y have a similar form which
is then fully determined by (13.83)–(13.85).
Corollary 13.3. The real eigenvalues of A are the same as those of A.
Proof. Direct computation (or (13.78)–(13.80)) shows that
det A = det A −4Φ(a, b, c).
(13.98)
But −4Φ(a, b, c) is precisely the sum of the roots of (13.95), and replacing A
by A merely ﬂips the sign of r, that is r[A] = −r[A]. Thus, the two possible
values of det A+r[A] are precisely the same as those for det A+r[A]. Since
tr A = tr A and σ(A) = σ(A), (13.94) is unchanged.
The solutions of (13.94) are real, since the corresponding 24 × 24 real
symmetric matrix has 24 real eigenvalues. We will refer to the three real
solutions of (13.94) corresponding to a single value of r as a family of
eigenvalues of A.
There are thus two families of real eigenvalues, each
corresponding to four independent (over R) eigenvectors.
We note several intriguing properties of these results. If A is in fact
complex, then the only solution of (13.95) is r = 0, and we recover the
usual characteristic equation with a unique set of three (real) eigenvalues.

148
The Geometry of the Octonions
If A is quaternionic, then one solution of (13.95) is r = 0, leading to the
standard set of three real eigenvalues and their corresponding quaternionic
eigenvectors. However, unless a, b, c involve only two independent imagi-
nary quaternionic directions (in which case Φ(a, b, c) = 0 = [a, b, c]), there
will also be a nonzero solution for r, leading to a second set of three real
eigenvalues. From the preceding corollary, we see that this second set of
eigenvalues consists precisely of the usual (r = 0) eigenvalues of A! Fur-
thermore, since
A(ℓv) = ℓ(Av),
(13.99)
if the components of A and v are in H and for imaginary ℓ∈O orthogonal
to H, the eigenvectors of A corresponding to r ̸= 0 are precisely ℓtimes
the quaternionic (r = 0) eigenvectors of A. In this sense, the octonionic
eigenvalue problem for quaternionic A is equivalent to the quaternionic
eigenvalue problem for both A and A together. Finally, if A is octonionic
(so that in particular [a, b, c] ̸= 0), then there are two distinct solutions
for r, and hence two diﬀerent sets of real eigenvalues, with corresponding
eigenvectors. Note that if det A = 0 ̸= [a, b, c] then all of the eigenvalues
of A will be nonzero!
The ﬁnal surprise lies with the orthogonality condition for eigenvectors
v, w corresponding to diﬀerent eigenvalues. As in the 2 × 2 case considered
in Section 13.2, it is not true that v†w = 0, although the real part of this
expression does vanish, that is,
v†w + w†v = 0.
(13.100)
However, just as in the 2×2 case, what is needed to ensure a decomposition
of the form
A =
3

m=1
λmvmv†
m
(13.101)
is (13.27), and a lengthy, direct computation veriﬁes that (13.27) holds
provided that both eigenvectors correspond to the same value of r.
Lemma 13.5. If v and w are eigenvectors of the 3 × 3 octonionic Her-
mitian matrix A corresponding to diﬀerent real eigenvalues in the same
family (same r value), then v and w are mutually orthogonal in the sense
of (13.27), that is, (vv†)w = 0.
Proof. The modiﬁed characteristic equation (13.94) can be used to elimi-
nate cubic and higher powers of λ from any expression. Furthermore, given

two distinct eigenvalues λ1 ̸= λ2, subtracting the two versions of (13.94)
and factoring the result leads to the equation
(λ2
1 + λ1λ2 + λ2
2) −tr A(λ1 + λ2) + σ(A) = 0
(13.102)
thus eliminating quadratic terms in one of the eigenvalues. The result now
follows by (lengthy!) computation.8
For
Jordan
matrices,
we
thus
obtain
two
decompositions
of
the
form (13.101), corresponding to the two sets of real eigenvalues. For each,
the eigenvectors are ﬁxed up to orthogonal transformations which preserve
the form (13.97) of z.
Theorem 13.1. Let A be a 3 × 3 octonionic Hermitian matrix.
Then
A can be expanded as in (13.101), where {v1, v2, v3} are orthonormal (as
per (13.27)) eigenvectors of A corresponding to the real eigenvalues λm,
which belong to the same family (same r value).
Proof. Fix a family of real eigenvalues of A by ﬁxing r. If the eigenvalues
are distinct, then the previous lemma guarantees the existence of orthonor-
mal eigenvectors, which are also eigenvectors of the decomposition (13.101)
with the same eigenvalues, and the result follows.
If the eigenvalues are the same, the family consists of a single real eigen-
value λ with multiplicity three. Then tr (A) = 3λ and σ(A) = 3λ2. Writing
out these two equations in terms of the components (13.77) of A, and in-
serting the ﬁrst into the second, results in a quadratic equation for λ; the
discriminant D of this equation satisﬁes D ≤0. But λ is assumed to be
real, which forces D = 0, which in turn forces A to be a multiple of the
identity matrix, for which the result holds.
The remaining case is when one eigenvalue, say µ, has multiplicity two
and one has multiplicity one. Letting v be a (normalized) eigenvector with
eigenvalue µ, consider the matrix
X = A −α vv†
(13.103)
with α ∈R. For most values of α, X will have three distinct real eigenval-
ues, whose eigenvectors will be orthogonal by the previous theorem. But
this means that eigenvectors of X are also eigenvectors of A; the required
8We used Mathematica to implement these simpliﬁcations in a brute force veriﬁcation
of (13.27) in this context, which ran for six hours on a SUN Sparc20 with 224 Mb of
RAM [25]. An amusing footnote to this story is that the subsequent version of Math-
ematica was unable to ﬁnish this computation on the same hardware, although later
versions (on better hardware) can reproduce the computation much more quickly.

150
The Geometry of the Octonions
decomposition of A is obtained from that of X simply by solving (13.103)
for A.
Note in particular that for some quaternionic matrices with determinant
equal to zero, one and only one of these two decompositions will contain
the eigenvalue zero.
In the 2 × 2 case,
(vv†)(vv†) = (v†v)(vv†)
(13.104)
which tells us that, for normalized v, vv† squares to itself, and hence is
idempotent. The decomposition analogous to (13.101) in the 2 × 2 case is
thus an idempotent decomposition. But (13.104) fails in the 3 × 3 case,
so that the decomposition in Theorem 13.1 is therefore not an idempotent
decomposition.
It is nevertheless straightforward to show that if u, v, and w are or-
thonormal in the sense of (13.27) then
uu† + vv† + ww† = I
(13.105)
since the left-hand side has eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity three. This per-
mits us to view {u, v, w} as a basis of O3 in the following sense
Lemma 13.6. Let u, v, w ∈O3 be orthonormal in the sense of (13.27) and
let g be any vector in O3. Then
g = (uu†) g + (vv†) g + (ww†) g.
(13.106)
Proof. This result follows immediately from (13.105).
However, another consequence of the failure of (13.104) in the 3 × 3 case
is that the Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization procedure no longer works. It
appears to be fortuitous that we are nevertheless able to ﬁnd orthonormal
eigenvectors in the 3×3 case with repeated eigenvalues; we suspect that this
might fail in general, perhaps already in the 4 × 4 case with an eigenvalue
of multiplicity three.
We can relate our notion of orthonormality to the usual one by noting
that n vectors in On which are orthonormal in the sense (13.27) satisfy
vv† + · · · + ww† = I.
(13.107)
If we deﬁne a matrix U whose columns are just v, . . . , w, then this statement
is equivalent to
UU † = I.
(13.108)

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
151
Over the quaternions, left matrix inverses are the same as right matrix
inverses, and we would also have
U†U = I
(13.109)
or equivalently
v†v = 1 = · · · = w†w,
v†w = 0 = · · ·
(13.110)
which is just the standard notion of orthogonality. These two notions of
orthogonality fail to be equivalent over the octonions; we have been led to
view the former as more fundamental.
We can now rewrite the eigenvalue equation in the form
AU = UD
(13.111)
where D is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the real eigenvalues.9 Mul-
tiplying (13.111) on the left by U† yields
U †(AU) = U †(UD) = (U†U)D
(13.112)
(since D is real), but this does not lead to a diagonalization of A since, as
noted above, U†U is not in general equal to the identity matrix. However,
Theorem 13.1 can be rewritten as
A = UDU †
(13.113)
so that in this sense A is diagonalizable.
Furthermore, multiplication
of (13.111) on the right by U † shows that
(AU)U† = (UD)U† = A = A(UU†)
(13.114)
and this assertion of associativity can be taken as a restatement of Theo-
rem 13.1. In the 2×2 case, this associativity holds for a single eigenvector v,
that is,
(Av)v† = A(vv†)
(13.115)
which leads to the elegant one-line derivation

(13.116)
However, (13.115) fails in the 3 × 3 case, and we are unaware of a corre-
spondingly elegant proof of Theorem 13.1.
Our original proof of the 3 × 3 orthogonality result (13.5) used Math-
ematica to explicitly perform a horrendous, but exact, algebraic computa-
tion. Although Okubo [26] did later give an analytic proof of this result,
the Mathematica computation nevertheless establishes a result which would
otherwise have remained merely a conjecture. This is a good example of
being able to use the computer to verify one’s intuition when it may not be
possible to do so otherwise. This issue is further discussed in [25].
9Since the eigenvalues are real, it doesn’t matter if we put them on the right.

13.5
The 3 × 3 Non-real Eigenvalue Problem
Without being able to solve (some version of) the characteristic equation
in the 3 × 3 case, it is not possible in general to determine all the (non-
real) eigenvalues of a given Hermitian octonionic matrix. It is therefore
instructive to consider several explicit examples.

(13.117)
where
s = cos θ + kℓsin θ.
(13.118)
Note that B is quaternionic if θ = 0.
The real eigenvalues of B, and corresponding orthonormal bases of eigen-
vectors, were given in [25]. But B also admits eigenvectors with eigenvalues
which are not real. For instance:
λbu = p ± qs,
u± =


These eigenvectors and eigenvalues reduce to the ones given in [25] when
θ →0. Somewhat surprisingly, these eigenvectors (when normalized) yield
a decomposition of the form (13.101). Remarkably, they also yield a de-
composition of the form

The Geometry of the Octonions
However, we have been unable to ﬁnd any decompositions of B involving
these vectors. It is intriguing that, for instance, v1 is orthogonal to both u1
and w1 (in the sense of (13.27), but that u1 and w1 are not orthogonal. In
fact, we have shown using Mathematica that there is no eigenvector triple
containing w1 which is orthogonal in the sense of (13.27). Unless w1 is
special in some as yet to be determined sense, we are forced to conclude
that neither (13.27) nor (13.101) are generally true for eigenvectors whose
eigenvalues are not real. It is curious, however, that the sum of the squares
(outer products) of all six of these (normalized) vectors is indeed (twice)
the identity!
13.5.3
Example 3
In all of the examples considered so far, the eigenvalues have been in the
complex subalgebra of O determined by the associator [a, b, c] (with a, b, c
as in (13.77)). We now give an example for which this is not the case.
Consider

(13.134)
with eigenvalue

(13.135)
However, the associator takes the form
[a, b, c]
q3
= [i, (j −iℓ−jℓ), (1 + k + l)] = 2(l −k).
(13.136)
Further discussion of these examples appears in [27].
13.6
The Jordan Eigenvalue Problem10
In Sections 13.2–13.5, we considered both the left and right eigenvalue
problems for 2 × 2 and 3 × 3 octonionic Hermitian matrices. In the 3 × 3
10The material in this section is adapted from [28].

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
155
octonionic case, even if we assume that the eigenvalues are real, the eigen-
value problem does not quite behave as expected. For this case, there are
six, rather than three, real eigenvalues [24], which come in two independent
families, each consisting of three real eigenvalues which satisfy a modiﬁed
characteristic equation rather than the usual one. Furthermore, the corre-
sponding eigenvectors are not orthogonal in the usual sense, but do satisfy
a generalized notion of orthogonality (see also [25, 26]). Finally, all such
matrices admit a decomposition in terms of (the “squares” of) orthonormal
eigenvectors. However, due to associativity problems, these matrices are
not idempotents (matrices which square to themselves).
We describe here a related eigenvalue problem for 3×3 Hermitian octo-
nionic matrices which does have the standard properties: There are three
real eigenvalues, which solve the usual characteristic equation, and which
lead to a decomposition in terms of orthogonal “eigenvectors” which are
indeed (primitive) idempotents.
We consider the eigenmatrix problem
A ◦V = λV
(13.137)
where V is itself an octonionic Hermitian matrix and ◦denotes the Jordan
product [29,30]
A ◦B = 1
2 (AB + BA)
(13.138)
which is commutative but not associative. We further restrict V to be a
(primitive) idempotent; as discussed below, this ensures that the Jordan
eigenvalue problem (13.137) reduces to the traditional eigenvalue prob-
lem (13.9) in the non-octonionic cases. Since A and V are Jordan matrices,
the left-hand side of (13.137) is Hermitian, which forces λ to be real.
Suppose ﬁrst that A is diagonal. Then the diagonal elements p, m, n
are clearly eigenvalues, with obvious diagonal eigenmatrices. But there are
also other eigenvalues! For example,


p 0
0
0 m 0
0 0 n

◦


0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0

= p + m
2


0 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 0


(13.139)
so the averages (p+m)/2, (m+n)/2, (n+p)/2 are also eigenvalues. However,
the corresponding eigenmatrices—which are related to Peirce decomposi-
tions [31,32]—have only zeros on the diagonal, and cannot therefore square
to themselves. To exclude this case, we restrict V in (13.137) to the Cayley
plane, which ensures that the eigenmatrices are primitive idempotents; as

156
The Geometry of the Octonions
we will see, they really do correspond to “eigenvectors” v. Recall that this
condition forces the components of V to lie in a quaternionic subalgebra of
O (which depends on V) even though the components of A may not.
Next consider the characteristic equation (13.75) in the form
−det(A −λ I) = λ3 −(tr A) λ2 + σ(A) λ −(det A) I = 0.
(13.140)
It is not at ﬁrst obvious that all solutions λ of (13.140) are real. To see
that this is indeed the case, we note that A can be rewritten as a 24 × 24
real symmetric matrix, whose eigenvalues are of course real. However, as
discussed in Section 13.1, these latter eigenvalues do not satisfy the char-
acteristic equation (13.140)! Rather, they satisfy a modiﬁed characteristic
equation of the form
det(A −λ I) + r = 0
(13.141)
where r is either of the roots of a quadratic equation which depends on A,
namely (13.95). As shown explicitly using Mathematica in Figure 5 of [25],
not only are these roots real, but they have opposite signs (or at least
one is zero). But, as can be seen immediately using elementary graphing
techniques, if the cubic equation (13.141) has three real roots for both a
positive and a negative value of r, it also has three real roots for all values
of r in between, including r = 0. This argument shows that (13.140) does
indeed have three real roots.
Alternatively, since F4 preserves both the determinant and the trace
(and therefore also σ) [13,33], it leaves the characteristic equation invariant.
Since F4 can be used to diagonalize A [13, 28, 33] (see also Section 13.7),
and since the resulting diagonal elements clearly satisfy the characteristic
equation, we have another, indirect, proof that the characteristic equation
has three real roots. Furthermore, this argument shows that these roots
correspond precisely to the three real eigenvalues whose eigenmatrices lie in
the Cayley plane. We therefore reserve the word “eigenvalue” for the three
solutions of the characteristic equation (13.140), explicitly excluding their
averages. The above argument shows that these eigenvalues correspond to
solutions V of (13.137) which lie in the Cayley plane; we will verify this
explicitly below.
Restricting the eigenvalues in this way corresponds to the traditional
eigenvalue problem in the following sense.
If the components of A and
v ̸= 0 lie in a quaternionic subalgebra of the octonions, then the Jordan
eigenvalue problem (13.137) together with the restriction to the Cayley
plane becomes
A vv† + vv†A = 2λ vv†.
(13.142)

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
157
Multiplying (13.142) on the right by v and simplifying the result using the
trace of (13.142) leads immediately to Av = λv (with λ ∈R), that is,
the Jordan eigenvalue equation implies the ordinary eigenvalue equation
in this context. Since the converse is immediate, the Jordan eigenvalue
problem (13.137) (with V restricted to the Cayley plane but A octonionic)
is seen to be a reasonable generalization of the ordinary eigenvalue problem.
We now show how to construct eigenmatrices V of (13.137), restricted
to lie in the Cayley plane, and with real eigenvalues λ satisfying the charac-
teristic equation (13.140). From the deﬁnition of the determinant, we have
for real λ that satisfying (13.140)
0 = det(A −λ I) = (A −λ I) ◦((A −λ I) ∗(A −λ I)).
(13.143)
Thus, setting
Qλ = (A −λ I) ∗(A −λ I)
(13.144)
we have
(A −λ I) ◦Qλ = 0
(13.145)
so that Qλ is a solution of (13.137).
Due to the identity
(X ∗X) ∗(X ∗X) = (det X) X
(13.146)
we have
Qλ ∗Qλ = 0.
(13.147)
If Qλ ̸= 0, we can renormalize Qλ by deﬁning
Pλ =
Qλ
tr (Qλ).
(13.148)
Each resulting Pλ is in the Cayley plane, and is hence a primitive idempo-
tent. Due to (13.147) and (12.69), we can write
Pλ = vλv†
λ
(13.149)
and we call vλ the (generalized) eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λ. Note
that vλ does not in general satisfy either (13.1) or (13.9). Rather, we have
A ◦vλv†
λ = λ vλv†
λ
(13.150)
as well as
v†
λvλ = 1.

(13.153)
one computes directly that
Qλ ◦(A ◦Qµ) = (Qλ ◦A) ◦Qµ.
(13.154)
If λ, µ are solutions of the characteristic equation (13.140), then us-
ing (13.145) leads to
µ (Qλ ◦Qµ) = λ (Qλ ◦Qµ).
(13.155)
If we now assume λ ̸= µ and Qλ ̸= 0 ̸= Qµ, this computation shows that
eigenmatrices corresponding to diﬀerent eigenvalues are orthogonal in the
sense
Pλ ◦Pµ = 0
(13.156)
where we have normalized the eigenmatrices.
We now turn to the case Qλ = 0. We have ﬁrst that
tr (Qλ) = tr ((A −λ I) ∗(A −λ I)) = σ(A −λ I).
(13.157)
Denoting the three real solutions of the characteristic equation (13.140) by
λ, µ, ν, so that
tr A = λ + µ + ν,
(13.158)
σ(A) = λ(µ + ν) + µν,
(13.159)
we then have
σ(A −λ I) = σ(A) −2λ tr A + 3λ2 = (λ −µ)(λ −ν).
(13.160)
But by (13.147) and (12.78), Qλ = 0 if and only if tr (Qλ) = 0.
Us-
ing (13.157) and (13.160), we therefore see that Qλ = 0 if and only if λ is a
solution of (13.140) of multiplicity greater than one. We will return to this
case below.
Putting this all together, if there are no repeated solutions of the char-
acteristic equation (13.140), then the eigenmatrix problem leads to the
decomposition
A =
3

(13.161)

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems
159
in terms of orthogonal primitive idempotents, which expresses each Jordan
matrix A as a sum of squares of quaternionic columns.11 We emphasize
that the components of the eigenmatrices Pλi need not lie in the same
quaternionic subalgebra, and that A is octonionic. Nonetheless, it is re-
markable that A admits a decomposition in terms of matrices which are,
individually, quaternionic.
We now return to the case Qλ = 0, corresponding to repeated eigenval-
ues. If λ is a solution of the characteristic equation (13.140) of multiplicity
three, then tr A = 3λ and σ(A) = 3λ2. As shown in [21] in a diﬀerent
context, or using an argument along the lines of footnote 11, this forces
A = λ I, which has a trivial decomposition into orthonormal primitive
idempotents. We are left with the case of multiplicity two, corresponding
to A ̸= λ I and Qλ = 0.
Since Qλ = 0, A−λ I is (up to normalization) in the Cayley plane, and
we have
A −λ I = ±ww†
(13.162)
with the components of w in some quaternionic subalgebra of O. While
ww† is indeed an eigenmatrix of A, it has eigenvalue µ = tr (A) −2λ ̸= λ.
However, it is straightforward to construct a vector v orthogonal to w in a
suitable sense. For instance, if
w =


x
y
r


(13.163)
with r ∈R, then choosing
v =


|y|2
−yx
0


(13.164)
leads to
vv† ◦ww† = 0
(13.165)
and only minor modiﬁcations are required to adapt this example to the
general case. But (13.162) now implies that
A ◦vv† = λ vv†
(13.166)
so that we have constructed an eigenmatrix of A with eigenvalue λ.
11To see this, one easily veriﬁes that tr (B) = 0 = σ(B), where B = A −P λiPλi. But
this implies that tr (B2) = 0, which forces B = 0.

The Geometry of the Octonions
We can now perturb A slightly by adding ϵ vv†, thus changing the eigen-
value of vv† by ϵ. The resulting matrix will have three unequal eigenvalues,
and hence admit a decomposition (13.161) in terms of orthogonal primitive
idempotents. But these idempotents will also be eigenmatrices of A, and
hence yield an orthogonal primitive idempotent decomposition of A.12 In
summary, decompositions analogous to (13.161) can also be found when
there is a repeated eigenvalue, but the terms corresponding to the repeated
eigenvalue cannot be written in terms of the projections Pλ, and of course
the decomposition of the corresponding eigenspace is not unique.13
13.7
Diagonalizing Jordan Matrices with F4
The group F4 is the automorphism group of both the Jordan and Freuden-
thal products, that is, if X, Y ∈H3(O), and φ ∈F4, then
φ(X ◦Y) = φ(X) ◦φ(Y),
(13.171)
φ(X ∗Y) = φ(X) ∗φ(Y).
(13.172)
Loosely speaking, F4 allows us to change basis in H3(O), without aﬀecting
normalization or inner products. We have seen in Section 13.6 that there
is indeed an eigenvalue problem for any Jordan matrix X ∈H3(O), with
exactly three real eigenvalues (counting multiplicity). We therefore expect
12More formally, with the above assumptions we have
(A + ϵ vv† −λ I) ∗(A + ϵ vv† −λ I) = (ww† + ϵ vv†) ∗(ww† + ϵ vv†)
= 2ϵ vv† ∗ww†.
(13.167)
The Freudenthal square of (13.167) is zero by (14.110), which shows that
det(A + ϵ vv† −λ I) = 0
(13.168)
by (13.146), so that λ is indeed an eigenvalue of the perturbed matrix A + ϵ vv†. Fur-
thermore, (13.167) itself is not zero (unless v or w vanishes) since (13.165) implies that
2 tr (vv† ∗ww†) = (v†v)(w†w) ̸= 0
(13.169)
which shows that λ does not have multiplicity two.
13An invariant orthogonal idempotent decomposition when λ is an eigenvalue of multi-
plicity two is
A = µ
(A −λ I)
tr (A −λ I) −λ

(A −λ I)
tr (A −λ I)
(13.170)
where the coeﬃcient of µ = tr (A) −2λ is the primitive idempotent corresponding to
the other eigenvalue and the coeﬃcient of λ is an idempotent but not primitive. An
equivalent expression was given in [30].

Octonionic Eigenvalue Problems

to be able to ﬁnd a basis in which X is diagonal. We show here that this
expectation is correct, and any Jordan matrix can be diagonalized using F4
transformations.
We start with a Jordan matrix in the form (13.77), and show how to
diagonalize it using nested F4 transformations. As discussed in [13], a set
of generators for F4 can be obtained by considering its SO(9) subgroups,
which in turn can be generated by 2 × 2 tracefree, Hermitian, octonionic
matrices.
Just as for the traditional diagonalization procedure, it is ﬁrst necessary
to solve the characteristic equation for the eigenvalues. Let λ be a solution
of (13.75), and let vv† ̸= 0 be a solution of (13.137) with eigenvalue λ.14
We assume further that the phase in v is chosen such that
v =

(13.173)
where x, y ∈O and r ∈R. Deﬁne

N 2

1 + |y|2 = v†v ̸= 0. (If N1 = 0, then A is already block diagonal.)
It is straightforward to check that
M2M1v =





(13.176)
and, since everything so far is quaternionic, this implies

0 0 0
0 0 1

= E3
(13.177)
since there are no associativity problems.
14It is straightforward to construct v using the results of Section 13.6, especially since
we can assume without loss of generality that λ is an eigenvalue of multiplicity one.

The Geometry of the Octonions
But conjugation by each of the Mi is an F4 transformation (which is
well-deﬁned since each Mi separately has components which lie in a com-
plex subalgebra of O); this is precisely the form of the generators referred
to earlier. Furthermore, F4 is the automorphism group of the Jordan prod-
uct (13.138). Thus, since
(A −λ vv†) ◦vv† = 0
(13.178)
then after applying the (nested!) F4 transformation above, we obtain

M2(M1(A −λ I)M1)M2

Chapter 14
The Physics of the Octonions
14.1
Spin
We begin by considering angular momentum in quantum mechanics. An-
gular momentum is deﬁned classically as the cross product of position and
momentum, that is
⃗L = ⃗r × ⃗p.
(14.1)
In quantum mechanics, momentum is replaced by a diﬀerential operator,
that is
⃗p −→−iℏ⃗∇.
(14.2)
Inserting (14.2) into (14.1) we obtain the components of the angular mo-
mentum operator as
Lx = −iℏ(y∂z −z∂y),
(14.3)
Ly = −iℏ(z∂x −x∂z),
(14.4)
Lz = −iℏ(x∂y −y∂x).
(14.5)
These operators have the following characteristic properties. First of
all, the commutator of any two is proportional to the third, so that
[Lx, Ly] = LxLy −LyLx = iℏLz
(14.6)
and similarly for cyclic permutations. The second property is more subtle.
The total angular momentum operator is
L2 = |⃗L|2 = ⃗L · ⃗L.
(14.7)
When one separates variables in the Schr¨odinger equation in a central po-
tential, the diﬀerential equation corresponding to the spherical angle θ re-
duces to an eigenvalue equation for the operator L2. Imposing the bound-
ary condition that the solutions should be well-behaved at the poles, the
eigenvalues take the form l(l + 1)ℏ2, where l is a non-negative integer.
163

164
The Geometry of the Octonions
The famous Stern–Gerlach experiment split a beam of atoms into sep-
arate beams for each of the 2l + 1 allowed angular momentum states. If
l is an integer, there should therefore be an odd number of beams. But
the experiment produced two beams of silver atoms, thus showing that the
angular momentum of the valence electron corresponds to l = 1
2. How can
we describe this phenomenon?
The commutation relations (14.6) (and cyclic permutations) can also be
represented using matrices. A particularly nice choice is given in terms of
the Pauli matrices
σx =

0 1

(14.8)
that were introduced in Section 7.3. If we now deﬁne
La = ℏ
2 σa
(14.9)
where a = x, y, z, then
[Lx, Ly] = LxLy −LyLx = iℏLz.
(14.10)
If we interpret the Lm as the components of some sort of angular momen-
tum, and compute the corresponding total angular momentum
L2 = L2
x + L2
y + L2
z
(14.11)
we discover that
L2 = 3
4ℏ2I
(14.12)
since each of the Pauli matrices squares to the identity matrix. This de-
scription corresponds to l = 1
2 (since 3
4 = 1
2( 1
2 + 1)).
This new concept of angular momentum is however distinct from orbital
angular momentum, and is therefore called spin angular momentum, or
simply spin.1
Spinors represent states of spin- 1
2 particles such as the electron. Spinors
are important because they are needed to give a spin- 1
2 representation of
the angular momentum algebra (14.6).
1There is a well-known 3 × 3 representation of (14.6), involving matrices of the form
ℏ

and cyclic permutations. The total angular momentum operator in this case—the sum
of the squares of the three matrices—is 2ℏtimes the identity, corresponding to l = 1;
this is a spin-1 representation of (14.6), corresponding to ordinary vectors in R3.

The Physics of the Octonions
165
Here’s a crash course in quantum mechanics. Physical states are rep-
resented by elements in a Hilbert space, which in this case consists of
2-component spinors. Any multiple of a given state v represents the same
physical state, so we usually consider only normalized states, that is, we
demand that v†v = 1. Operators such as Lz act on the state v by ordinary
matrix multiplication, which takes v to some other state, given in this case
by Lzv. The expectation value of the operator Lz in the state v is given
by v†Lzv,2 and gives the (average) result of (a large number of) physical
measurements, in this case of the z-component of spin.
There are special states which satisfy the eigenvalue equation
Lzvλ = λvλ
(14.13)
for some λ. The eigenvalues λ are the only possible results of physical mea-
surements; it is only in an eigenstate vλ that the measured value actually
equals the expectation value. By requiring physical quantities (“observ-
ables”) to correspond to Hermitian matrices, we ensure that the result of
any measurement is real, since the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices are
real—at least, over C. (See Chapter 13 for a discussion of what happens
over H and O.)
What are the eigenstates of Lz? We have
Lzv± = ±ℏ
2 v±
(14.14)
where
v+ =
1
0

,
v−=
0
1

.
(14.15)
The expectation value of either Lx or Ly is 0 in these states: A “spin-up”
electron is equally likely to be “spin-left” as “spin-right”. Furthermore, v±
are not eigenstates of either Lx or Ly. Only operators which commute
with each other correspond to observables that can be measured simulta-
neously. It is therefore not possible to simultaneously measure more than
one component of angular momentum!
As discussed in Section 7.3, the Pauli matrices are also closely related
to rotations in three dimensions—as they should be if they are to describe
2Those familiar with the Dirac “bra/ket” notation can make the identiﬁcations

⟨v| ←→v†.

angular momentum. Using (14.9), we see that
Lz = iℏdRz
dα

α=0
(14.16)
and similarly for Ly and Lx.
The spin operators are thus inﬁnitesimal
rotations; they live in the Lie algebra corresponding to the Lie group of
3-dimensional rotations.
14.2
Quaternionic Spin
In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of a self-adjoint operator correspond
to the physical states with particular values of the corresponding observable
physical quantity. A fundamental principle of quantum mechanics further
states that after making a measurement the system is “projected” into the
corresponding eigenstate. It is therefore only eigenstates which are unaf-
fected by the measurement process; they are projected into themselves. In
particular, in order to simultaneously make two measurements, the sys-
tem must be in an eigenstate of each; otherwise, the order in which the
measurements are made will matter.
As discussed in Section 14.1, the spin operators Lm are imaginary mul-
tiples of the derivatives (“inﬁnitesimal generators”) of the rotations Rm
introduced originally in Section 7.3. Writing ra for those derivatives, we
have
ra = dRz

to 1) to obtain a description of the Lie algebra su(2) in terms of Hermitian
matrices.
As discussed in [34,35], however, even in the quaternionic setting care
must be taken with this last step; we must put the factor of ℓin the right
place! The right place turns out to be on the right; we deﬁne the operator
Lm(ψ) = −(rmψ)ℓ
(14.19)

The Physics of the Octonions
167
where ψ is a 2-component octonionic column (representing a Majorana-
Weyl spinor in ten spacetime dimensions).
The operators Lm are self-
adjoint with respect to the inner product

(14.20)
where the map
π(q) = 1
2(q + ℓqℓ)
(14.21)
projects O to a preferred complex subalgebra C ⊂O, namely the one
containing ℓ.
Spin eigenstates are the eigenvectors of Lz, whose eigenvalues are ± 1

(really ± ℏ
2). What are the eigenvectors of Lz? Unsurprisingly, we have

(14.22)
(We could of course have written the eigenvalue on the left since it is real.)

2.
For instance, we have
Lz
0

(14.23)
Note the crucial role played by the anticommutativity of the quaternions

e↓=

(14.25)
and which were proposed as representing particles3 at rest with spin ± 1
2,
respectively. The eigenstates e↑and e↓are orthogonal with respect to the
above inner product, that is
⟨e↑, e↓⟩= 0.
(14.26)
We will therefore focus on these eigenstates, which have some extraordinary
properties.
3These two papers used diﬀerent conventions to distinguish particles from antiparticles;
we adopt the conventions used in [35].

with similar results holding for e↓, illustrating the fact that this quater-

are not real. More importantly, as claimed in [34, 35], it shows that e↑is
a simultaneous eigenvector of the three self-adjoint spin operators Lx, Ly,
and Lz!
This result could have signiﬁcant implications for quantum mechanics.
In this formulation, the inability to completely measure the spin state of a
particle, because the spin operators fail to commute, is thus ultimately due
to the fact that the eigenvalues don’t commute. Explicitly, we have
4Lx

so that the non-real eigenvalues depend on the phase. It is intriguing to
speculate on whether the value of the non-real eigenvalues, which determine
the phase, can be used to specify (but not measure) the actual direction of
the spin, and whether this might shed some insight on basic properties of
quantum mechanics such as Bell’s inequality.
Finally, we point out that all eigenvectors of the complex operators
Lx, Ly, Lz turn out to be quaternionic; each eigenvector lies in some
quaternionic subalgebra of O which also contains ℓ.
14.3
Introduction to the Dirac Equation
The Dirac equation describes the quantum mechanical state of a relativistic,
massive, spin- 1
2 particle, such as the electron. The Dirac equation in four
dimensions is usually given as
(iℏγµ∂µ −mc)Ψ = 0.
(14.35)
What do these symbols mean? First of all, m is the mass of the particle
described by Ψ, c is the speed of light (which we normally set to 1) and
ℏis Planck’s constant (divided by 2π). The notation ∂µ is short for
∂
∂xµ ,
and the repeated index µ implies a summation over the spacetime index
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, where x0 = ct, x1 = x, x2 = y, and x3 = z. But what is γµ?
We will brieﬂy postpone this question.
The form (14.35) assumes that the “squared length” of the spacetime
vector whose components are xµ is given by4
gµνxµxν = (x0)2 −(x1)2 −(x2)2 −(x3)2
(14.36)
so that the spacetime metric is given by the matrix
(gµν) =



0 −1

.
(14.37)
What happens if we multiply the Dirac equation (14.35) by the diﬀer-
ential operator obtained by replacing m with −m? We get
0 = (iℏγµ∂µ + mc)(iℏγν∂ν −mc)Ψ = −(ℏ2γµ∂µγν∂ν + m2c2)Ψ
(14.38)
4These signs determine a choice of signature. The other choice is to use −gµν for the
metric components, which eliminates the i in (14.35) (and multiplies all the γ matrices
by i).

170
The Geometry of the Octonions
where we have been careful to use diﬀerent dummy indices in the two
implicit sums.
The right-hand side almost looks like the Klein–Gordon
equation,
(ℏ2□+ m2c2)φ = 0,
(14.39)
a wave equation which describes the state of a relativistic, massive, spin-0
particle. Here, □is the d’Alembertian operator, the spacetime version of
the Laplacian, which is given by
□= gµν∂µ∂ν = ∂2
t −△= ∂2
t −∇2
(14.40)
where (gµν) is the inverse metric, that is, the inverse of the matrix (gµν).
The Klein–Gordon equation was known to Dirac, but there were diﬃcul-
ties (later resolved) interpreting the squares of its solutions as probability
densities, arising from the equation being second order. Dirac was led to
his ﬁrst-order equation by reversing the argument just given, thus “fac-
toring” the Klein–Gordon equation. To make this work, he had to show
that (14.38) really is the Klein–Gordon equation.
Assume that each γµ is constant. Then we must solve the equation
γµγν∂µ∂ν = gµν∂µ∂ν.
(14.41)
Writing out all the terms of (14.41) and comparing coeﬃcients of ∂µ∂ν,
remembering that partial derivative operators commute (∂µ∂ν = ∂ν∂µ), we
obtain
{γµ, γν} = γµγν + γνγµ = gµν + gνµ = 2gµν
(14.42)
where we have introduced the curly bracket notation for anticommutators.
It is easily seen that (14.42) has no solutions if each γµ is a number. Dirac’s
brilliant idea was to use matrices instead, which we will discuss in Sec-
tion 14.4.
Suppose that Ψ is a plane-wave of the form
Ψ = e−ipνxν/ℏΨ0
(14.43)
where pν is the 4-momentum of the particle and where Ψ0 does not depend
on xµ. Inserting (14.43) into (14.35) leads to the momentum space Dirac
equation
(γµpµ −mc)Ψ0 = 0
(14.44)
which is purely algebraic.5 (We will usually write Ψ rather than Ψ0.)
5One can also view (14.44) as the Fourier transform of (14.35).
Equivalently, one
obtains (14.44) from (14.35) by the formal substitution iℏ∂µ →pµ.

The Physics of the Octonions
171
Note the absence of any explicit factors of i in the momentum-space
Dirac equation (14.44)! We view momentum space as more fundamental
than position space, and deliberately chose the metric signature to achieve
this property.
It is now straightforward to generalize (14.44) to higher
dimensions using the other division algebras, which would not have been
the case had there been factors of i to worry about.
14.4
Gamma Matrices
In Section 14.3, we introduced the momentum-space Dirac equation, which
we rewrite in the form6
(γµ pµ −m)Ψ = 0
(14.45)
where we have set c = 1. The gamma matrices γµ satisfy
{γµ, γν} = γµγν + γνγµ = 2gµν.
(14.46)
How do we ﬁnd such matrices?
It turns out that, in all the cases we will be interested in, the gamma
matrices can be constructed in blocks from the Pauli matrices σa. We begin
by discussing how to construct big matrices from small ones in this way.
Imagine a chessboard.
It’s an 8 × 8 grid.
Now suppose it’s a
3-dimensional chess game. Easy; just stack eight boards on top of each
other. But there’s no need to stack them vertically! Simply put eight ordi-
nary chess boards next to each other, and you can still play 3-dimensional
chess. What about four dimensions? Take eight rows of eight chessboards
each. You can keep going to get a chess game in any (ﬁnite!) dimension,
but four is enough for our needs.
How do you label a square in our 4-dimensional chess game? You need
to specify both the chessboard, and the square on the chessboard. But each
of these speciﬁcations corresponds to an element of an 8 × 8 matrix! Thus,
a square on the chessboard is labeled by specifying an element of two 8 × 8
matrices.
Of course, we can also imagine this setup as a single 64 × 64 board,
whose squares are speciﬁed by giving an element of a 64 × 64 matrix. We
have thus built up a 64×64 matrix using two 8×8 matrices, one to describe
6Indices can be raised and lowered using the metric; a time component (index 0) is
unchanged, while a space component (indices 1–3) picks up a minus sign.

indices being summed over should always have one up and one down, in which case it
doesn’t matter which is which.

block.
Consider doing this construction with 2 × 2 matrices, rather than 8 × 8.
Suppose the ﬁrst is
σ1 = σx =

0 1
1 0

(14.47)
and the second is the identity matrix. What is the result?
The ﬁrst matrix, σ1, gives the block structure: The upper-left and
lower-right blocks are (multiplied by) 0, while the remaining blocks are
(multiplied by) 1. What’s in each block? The identity matrix! What is the
result? We write
σ1 ⊗I =




0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0



(14.48)
where the symbol ⊗is read “tensor”; this is a tensor product. Tensors are
generalizations of matrices, in this case a 4-dimensional array of numbers,
which is 2 × 2 × 2 × 2. Just as with the chessboards, we reinterpret this as
an ordinary matrix, which in this case is 4 × 4.
The power of this description comes from the fact that matrix multipli-
cation is compatible with the tensor product, in the sense that
(A1 ⊗B1)(A2 ⊗B2) = (A1A2) ⊗(B1B2).
(14.49)
Compatibility doesn’t quite work for anticommutators, except in special
cases. One such case occurs if either [A1, A2] = 0 or [B1, B2] = 0, for
which
{(A1 ⊗B1), (A2 ⊗B2)} = 1
2{A1, A2} ⊗{B1, B2}.
(14.50)
By constructing the gamma matrices as tensor products of Pauli matrices,
we can use (14.49) and (14.50) to work out products of gamma matrices in
terms of products of Pauli matrices, which are much easier. Remembering
that
σ2 = σy =

0 −i



σ3 = σz =

(14.51)
it is easy to check that the Pauli matrices anticommute and square to the
identity, that is,
{σa, σb} = 2δab
(14.52)

The Physics of the Octonions
173
where δab is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if a = b and 0 otherwise.
There are many possible choices of matrices γµ which satisfy (14.46);
each such choice is called a representation (more formally, a representation
of the underlying Cliﬀord algebra). We seek a minimal representation, that
is, we are looking for the smallest matrices possible, so that the solutions Ψ
of the Dirac equation have as few physical degrees of freedom as possible.
In four dimensions, the smallest matrices that can be used are 4 × 4, but
there are still many representations.
We choose a representation which will generalize nicely to the other
division algebras, namely
γ0 = σ1 ⊗I =

0 I
I 0

,
(14.53)
γa = iσ2 ⊗σa =

0
σa
−σa
0

,
(14.54)
where a = 1, 2, 3. These expressions are carefully chosen so that, given any
two distinct gamma matrices, exactly one of the factors commutes. Us-
ing (14.50), it is then obvious that distinct gamma matrices anticommute;
all that remains to be checked is that they square to the correct multiples
of the identity matrix. They do.
This representation is not the one found in most introductory text-
books. It has the advantage that all of the gamma matrices have the same
oﬀ-diagonal block structure. This structure emphasizes the fundamental
role played by the mass term in the Dirac equation, which multiplies the
identity matrix. Such a representation is called a chiral or Weyl represen-
tation (because the eigenspinors of the chiral projection operator take on a
particularly nice form). Multiplying the Dirac equation (14.45) on the left
by γ0 brings it to a form equivalent to Dirac’s original formulation, namely
(γ0γµ pµ −mγ0)Ψ = 0.
(14.55)
This form emphasizes the chiral nature of the representation: The ﬁrst
term is block diagonal, and the mass term “couples” the otherwise unre-
lated blocks. Furthermore, both matrix coeﬃcients (γ0γµ and γ0) are now
Hermitian—and both square to the identity matrix.
We have not yet said what Ψ is. Since the gamma matrices are matrices,
Ψ is clearly a column vector of the appropriate size. However, it turns out
that Ψ transforms in a particular way under the Lorentz group; Ψ is a
(Dirac) spinor; the description “column vector” is misleading, and will be
avoided.

174
The Geometry of the Octonions
The set of all products of gamma matrices is the basic example of a
Cliﬀord algebra. Using the anticommutativity properties, any such product
can be simpliﬁed so that it contains each gamma matrix at most once. Each
element of the Cliﬀord algebra can therefore be classiﬁed as even or odd
depending on the number of gamma matrices it contains. The product of
an even element with another even element is still even; the even part of the
Cliﬀord algebra is a subalgebra. In the chiral representation above, the even
elements are block diagonal, and the odd elements are block oﬀ-diagonal.
Our gamma matrices have the further advantage that they generalize
immediately to the other division algebras. First of all, the apparent factor
of i in (the ﬁrst factor of) γa isn’t really there; iσ2 is real. We can expand
our set of four Pauli matrices by including (in the second factor of γa) the
generalized Pauli matrices obtained from σ2 by replacing i by j, k, etc.7
There are as many of these matrices as there are imaginary units in the
division algebra; they still anticommute, by virtue of the division algebra
multiplication table, so that (14.50) still holds. Remembering to include
σx and σz, we get 3, 4, 6, or 10 gamma matrices over R, C, H, and O,
respectively. We will use this construction in Section 14.5 to discuss the
Dirac equation in higher dimensions.
14.5
The Dirac Equation
It’s time to put everything together. Insert (14.53) and (14.54) into (14.55).
Take advantage of the block structure by writing the (4-component) Dirac
spinor Ψ in terms of two (2-component) Penrose/Weyl spinors θ and η as
Ψ =

θ
η

(14.56)
which yields a particularly nice form of the Dirac equation, namely

p0I −paσa
−mI
−mI
p0I + paσa
 
θ
η

= 0.
(14.57)
We can do even better. The 2 × 2 matrix corresponding to the momentum
vector pµ is just
P = pµσµ
(14.58)
7We number the generalized Pauli matrices sequentially from 2, renumbering σ3 to put
it last. To avoid confusion, we will often use the indices x, y, z for the original Pauli
matrices, and j, k, etc. for the generalized Pauli matrices.

The Physics of the Octonions
175
and we introduce the notation
P = P −tr (P )I
(14.59)
for trace reversal, which reverses the sign of p0.8 Working out (14.57), the
Dirac equation reduces to the two equations
−P θ −mη = 0,
(14.60)
−mθ + P η = 0,
(14.61)
which no longer contain any gamma matrices!
Furthermore, insert-
ing (14.61) into (14.60) yields the constraint
−P P = m2I
(14.62)
or equivalently
pµpµ = m2
(14.63)
which is just the condition that the norm of the momentum vector be the
mass.
This construction works over any of the four division algebras, and over
the complex numbers we recover the usual formalism in four spacetime
dimensions. In this case, θ and η have two complex components. But since
H2 = C2 ⊕C2
(14.64)
we can replace a pair of complex 2-component spinors by a single quater-
nionic 2-component spinor. We choose the identiﬁcation


with A, B, C, D ∈C. Equivalently, we can write this identiﬁcation in terms
of the Penrose/Weyl spinors θ and η as
Ψ =

θ


←→ψ = η + σkθ
(14.66)
8We can therefore think of −eP as the 1-form (covariant vector) that is dual to P. This
interpretation is strengthened by noting that
−ePP = det(P)I = pµpµI.

where the generalized Pauli matrix σk is given by
σk =

.
(14.67)
Since (14.66) is clearly a vector space isomorphism, there is also an
isomorphism relating the linear maps on these spaces.
We can use the
induced isomorphism to rewrite the (4-dimensional, complex) Dirac equa-
tion (14.55) in 2-component quaternionic language. Direct computation
yields the correspondences
γ0γa ←→σa
(14.68)
and
γ0 ←→σk.
(14.69)
One way to see that these equivalences make sense is to notice that

(14.70)
Direct translation of (14.55) now leads to the quaternionic Dirac equa-
tion
(P −mσk)(η + σkθ) = 0.
(14.71)
Working backward, we can separate (14.71) into an equation not involv-
ing k, which is precisely (14.61), and an equation involving k, which is
P σkθ −mσkη = 0.
(14.72)
Multiplying (14.72) on the left by σk, and using the remarkable identity
σkP σk = −P
(14.73)
reduces (14.72) to (14.60), as expected.
So far, all we have done is rewrite the usual (4-dimensional, complex)
Dirac equation in 2-component quaternionic language. However, the ap-
pearance of the term mσk suggests a way to put the mass term on the same
footing as the other terms, which we now exploit. Multiplying (14.71) on
the left by −σk and using (14.73) brings the (4-dimensional) Dirac equation
to the form
( P + mσk) (θ + σkη) = 0.
(14.74)

The Physics of the Octonions
177
The spinor in parentheses is just σkψ, which we will henceforth relabel as
simply ψ, that is, from now on we write9
ψ = σk(η + σkθ) = θ + σkη.
(14.75)
When written out in full, (14.74) takes the form

−pt + pz
px −ℓpy −km
px + ℓpy + km
−pt −pz

ψ = 0.
(14.76)
which clearly suggests viewing the mass as an additional spacelike compo-
nent of a higher-dimensional vector. Furthermore, since the matrix multi-
plying ψ has determinant zero, this higher-dimensional vector is null. We
thus appear to have reduced the massive Dirac equation in four dimensions
to the massless Dirac, or Weyl, equation in higher dimensions, thus putting
the massive and massless cases on an equal footing. This expectation is in-
deed correct, as we will show below in the more general octonionic setting.
14.6
The Weyl Equation
Consider the Dirac equation (14.57) with m = 0. Then equations (14.60)
and (14.61) decouple, so it is enough to consider just one, say (14.60). This
is the Weyl equation
P ψ = 0
(14.77)
where we have written ψ instead of θ. In matrix notation, it is straight-
forward to show that the momentum pµ of a solution of the Weyl equation
must be null: (14.77) says that the 2 × 2 Hermitian matrix P has 0 as one
of its eigenvalues, which forces det(P ) = 0, which is precisely the condition
that pµ be null.
Note that P is a complex matrix; it contains only one octonionic direc-
tion. But a 2 × 2 complex Hermitian matrix with determinant zero can be
written as
P = ±θθ†
(14.78)
where θ is also complex. The general solution of (14.77) is
ψ = θξ
(14.79)
9This change in notation also inserts a minus sign into the correspondence (14.68), but
leaves (14.69) intact. We could of course have simply started with (14.75) in (14.65),
but that choice makes it slightly more diﬃcult to obtain (14.71).

178
The Geometry of the Octonions
where ξ ∈O is arbitrary. It follows immediately from (14.79) that
ψψ† = ±|ξ|2P
(14.80)
which says that the vector constructed from ψ is proportional to P .
Since there are still just two octonions in all, ξ and the components of θ
(and hence also those of P ) belong to a quaternionic subalgebra of O. Thus,
for solutions (14.79), the Weyl equation (14.77) itself becomes quaternionic!
We can assume without loss of generality that this quaternionic subal-
gebra is the one containing k and ℓ. We therefore have
P = ptI + pxσx + pyσy + pzσz + pkσk + pkℓσkℓ.
(14.81)
We can further assume, by a rotation in the plane containing k and kℓ
if necessary, that pkℓ= 0.
Writing m = pk brings P precisely to the
form (14.76)! The octonionic Weyl equation, describing massless spin- 1
2
particles in ten dimensions, can therefore be reduced to the complex Dirac
equation, describing, in general, massive spin- 1
2 particles in four dimensions.
We will pursue this program in the next section.
14.7
Leptons10
The description in the preceding sections of 10-dimensional Minkowski
space in terms of Hermitian octonionic matrices is a direct generalization of
the usual description of ordinary (4-dimensional) Minkowski space in terms
of complex Hermitian matrices. If we ﬁx a complex subalgebra C ⊂O,
then we single out a 4-dimensional Minkowski subspace of 10-dimensional
Minkowski space. The projection of a 10-dimensional null vector onto this
subspace is a causal 4-dimensional vector, which is null if and only if the
original vector was already contained in the subspace, and timelike other-
wise. The time orientation of the projected vector is the same as that of
the original, and the induced mass is given by the norm of the remaining
six components. Furthermore, the ordinary Lorentz group SO(3, 1) clearly
sits inside the Lorentz group SO(9, 1) via the identiﬁcation of their double
covers, the spin groups Spin(d, 1), namely
Spin(3, 1) = SL(2, C) ⊂SL(2, O) = Spin(9, 1).
(14.82)
Therefore, all it takes to break ten spacetime dimensions to four is to
choose a preferred octonionic unit to play the role of the complex unit.
10The material in this section is adapted from [35].

The Physics of the Octonions
179
We choose ℓrather than i to ﬁll this role, preferring to save i, j, k for a
(distinguished) quaternionic triple. The projection π from O to C is then
π(q) = 1
2(q + ℓqℓ)
(14.83)
and we thus obtain a preferred SL(2, C) subgroup of SL(2, O), correspond-
ing to the “physical” Lorentz group.
For each solution ψ of (14.77), the momentum is proportional to ψψ†
by (14.80). Up to an overall factor, we can therefore read oﬀthe components
of the 4-dimensional momentum pµ directly from π(ψψ†). The projection
of a 10-dimensional lightlike vector to four dimensions results in a causal
vector, that is, in a vector which is either lightlike or timelike. In other
words, the resulting 4-momentum is that of a massless or massive particle,
respectively. We can use a (4-dimensional!) Lorentz transformation to bring
a massive particle to rest, or to orient the momentum of a massless particle
to be in the z-direction.
As in the previous chapter, we will assume that the components of Ψ—
and hence also of P —lie in the quaternionic subalgebra containing k and ℓ,
and that pkℓ= 0. We therefore have
P = π(P ) + mσk
(14.84)
which shows explicitly the relationship between the higher-dimensional
lightlike vector P , the causal 4-dimensional vector π(P ), and the mass m.
If m ̸= 0, we can distinguish particles from antiparticles by the sign of
the term involving m, which is the coeﬃcient of σk in P . Equivalently, we
have the particle/antiparticle projections (at rest)
Π± = 1
2 (I ± σk) .
(14.85)
If m = 0, however, we can only distinguish particles from antiparticles in
momentum space by the sign of pt, as usual; this is the same as the sign
in (14.80).
Similarly, in this language, the chiral projection operator is
constructed from
Υ5 = σtσxσyσz = −
ℓ0
0 ℓ

.
(14.86)
However, as with spin, we must multiply by ℓin the correct place, that is
Υ5[ψ] = Υ5ψℓ.
(14.87)
As a result, even though Υ5 is a multiple of the identity, Υ5 is not, and
the operators 1
2(I ± Υ5) project H2 into the Weyl subspaces C2 ⊕C2k as
desired.

180
The Geometry of the Octonions
Combining the spin and particle information, over the quaternionic sub-
algebra H ⊂O determined by k and ℓ, we thus ﬁnd one massive spin- 1
2
particle at rest, with two spin states, namely
e↑=
1
k

,
e↓=
−k
1

.
(14.88)
Both of these spinors (of course) have the same momentum, namely
e↑e†
↑= e↓e†
↓=
1 −k
k
1

(14.89)
corresponding to a particle at rest (with m = 1).
The corresponding
antiparticles are obtained by replacing k by −k (and changing the sign
in (14.80)).
We also ﬁnd one massless spin- 1
2 particle involving k, namely
νz =
0
k

(14.90)
whose momentum is
νzν†
z =
0 0
0 1

(14.91)
and which is therefore moving at the speed of light in the z-direction. This
momentum-space state corresponds, as usual, to both a particle and its
antiparticle. It is important to note that
ν−z =
k
0

(14.92)
has momentum
ν−zν†
−z =
1 0
0 0

(14.93)
and thus corresponds to a massless particle with the same helicity moving in
the opposite direction, not to a diﬀerent particle with the opposite helicity.
Each of the above states may be multiplied (on the right) by an arbitrary
complex number without aﬀecting its properties.
So far we have one massive particle with two helicity states, and one
massless particle with a single helicity state. These are precisely the ob-
served mass and helicity properties of a generation of leptons! We therefore
interpret e as an electron, and ν as a neutrino.
We have so far been working with a particular quaternionic subalgebra.
How many such subalgebras are there? We want to include our preferred

complex unit, ℓ, so that the reduction to four dimensions will work. So we
are asking how many copies of H are there in O which contain a particular
copy of C. If we add the reasonable requirement that any two such sub-
algebras intersect only in C, then there precisely three such subalgebras,
labeled by i, j, and k, as shown in Figure 14.1. But there are precisely
three generations of leptons!
The careful reader will have noticed that we have left out a massless
particle, namely
Øz =
0
1

.
(14.94)
This particle is complex, and has the opposite helicity from the neutrinos ν.
As with the other massless states, this state describes both a particle and
an antiparticle. Alone among the particles, this one does not contain k,
and hence does not depend on the choice of identiﬁcation of a particular
quaternionic subalgebra H satisfying C ⊂H ⊂O.
We emphasize this basic asymmetry in the octonionic description of
particles. In a quaternionic description, we would have recovered the usual
solutions of the Dirac description, namely a massive particle with two
helicity states, and a massless particle with two helicity states. The fact
that one helicity state is complex and the other quaternionic would seem to
be simply a conventional choice. Over the octonions, however, there are
three massive particles, each with two helicity states, three massless parti-
cles with just one helicity state, and a single, complex massless state with
the opposite helicity; there are more massless particles of one helicity than
the other.

182
The Geometry of the Octonions
In conclusion, there is room in this octonionic description for precisely
the right number of leptons: exactly three generations, each containing
massless particles having only a single helicity. These two properties, ob-
served in nature, have yet to be explained theoretically.
But what about the extra particle, the Øz? In the picture presented
here, it has no generation structure. The other neutrinos are hard enough to
detect; it does not seem unreasonable to predict that this “sterile neutrino”
would interact weakly if at all with ordinary matter. Is this dark matter?!
14.8
Cayley Spinors
We have argued in Sections 14.3–14.7 that the ordinary momentum-space
(massless and massive) Dirac equation in 3 + 1 dimensions can be obtained
via dimensional reduction from the Weyl (massless Dirac) equation in 9+1
dimensions. This latter equation can be written as the eigenvalue problem
P ψ = 0
(14.95)
where P is a 2 × 2 octonionic Hermitian matrix corresponding to the 10-
dimensional momentum and tilde again denotes trace reversal. The general
solution of this equation is
P = ±θθ†,
(14.96)
ψ = θξ,
(14.97)
where θ is a 2-component octonionic vector whose components lie in the
same complex subalgebra of O as do those of P , and where ξ ∈O is
arbitrary. (Such a θ must exist since det(P ) = 0.)
It is then natural to introduce a 3-component formalism; this approach
was used by Schray [36,37] for the superparticle. Deﬁning
Ψ =
θ
ξ

(14.98)
we have ﬁrst of all that
P = ΨΨ† =
P
ψ
ψ† |ξ|2

(14.99)
so that Ψ combines the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Lorentz
transformations can be constructed by iterating (“nesting”) transforma-
tions of the form [5]
P →MP M †,
(14.100)
ψ →Mψ,
(14.101)

The Physics of the Octonions
183
which can be elegantly combined into the transformation
P →MPM†
(14.102)
with
M =
M 0


.
(14.103)
This construction in fact shows how to view SO(9, 1) as a subgroup of E6;
the rotation subgroup SO(9) lies in F4. It turns out that the Dirac equa-
tion (14.95) is equivalent to the equation
P ∗P = 0
(14.104)
which shows both that solutions of the Dirac equation correspond to the
Cayley plane and that the Dirac equation in ten dimensions admits E6 as a
symmetry group. Using the particle interpretation from Section 14.7 then
leads to the interpretation of (part of) the Cayley plane as representing
three generations of leptons.
We therefore refer to the 3-component octonionic column Ψ as a Cayley
spinor. This name is a bit misleading, as Ψ is not a “spinor” in the clas-
sical sense of belonging to an appropriate representation of an orthogonal
group (more precisely, of a spin group). However, Ψ does bear a similar
relationship to the “vector” P as the true spinor ψ does to the vector P .
We emphasize that not all 3-component octonionic columns are Cayley
spinors. For Ψ to be a Cayley spinor, ΨΨ† must satisfy the Dirac equa-
tion in the form (14.104), which, as we saw in Section 12.5, forces the
components of ΨΨ† to lie in a quaternionic subalgebra of O. As in the
above construction, we assume that the components of Ψ also lie in this
quaternionic subalgebra.
We conclude with a bit of speculation. We refer to P as a “1-square”,
since it is a primitive idempotent (squares to itself and has trace 1). In gen-
eral, we refer to decompositions of the form (13.161) as p-square decomposi-
tions, where p is the number of nonzero eigenvalues, and hence the number
of nonzero primitive idempotents in the decomposition. If det(A) ̸= 0, then
A is a 3-square. If det(A) = 0 ̸= σ(A), then A is a 2-square. Finally, if
det(A) = 0 = σ(A), then A is a 1-square (unless also tr (A) = 0, in which
case A = 0). It is intriguing that, since E6 preserves both the determinant
and the condition σ(A) = 0, E6 therefore preserves the class of p-squares for
each p. If, as argued above, 1-squares correspond to leptons, is it possible
that 2-squares are mesons and 3-squares are baryons?

The Jordan Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
It is well-known that the Albert algebra, introduced in Section 11.2, is the
only exceptional realization of the Jordan formulation of quantum mechan-
ics [17,29,30,38]; this is in fact how it was ﬁrst discovered. We summarize
this formalism here.
Recall that the Cayley plane, introduced in Section 12.5, consists of
those Jordan matrices V which satisfy the restriction [13,33]
V ◦V = V,
tr V = 1.
(14.105)
Elements of the Cayley plane correspond to projection operators in the
Jordan formulation of quantum mechanics. As shown in Section 12.5, the
conditions (14.105) force the components of V to lie in a quaternionic sub-
algebra of O (which depends on V). Basic (associative) linear algebra then
shows that each element of the Cayley plane is a primitive idempotent, and
can be written as
V = vv†
(14.106)
where v is a 3-component octonionic column vector, whose components lie
in the quaternionic subalgebra determined by V, and which is normalized
by
v†v = tr V = 1.
(14.107)
For given V, the vector v is unique up to a quaternionic phase. Furthermore,
using (12.64) and its trace (13.76), it is straightforward to show that, for
any Jordan matrix B,
B ∗B = 0 ⇐⇒B ◦B = (tr B) B
(14.108)
which agrees with (14.105) up to normalization, and which is therefore
the condition that that ±B can be written in the form (14.106) (without
the restriction (14.107)). For any Jordan matrix satisfying (14.108), the
normalization tr B can only be zero if v, and hence B itself, is zero, so that
B ∗B = 0 = tr B ⇐⇒B = 0
(14.109)
since the converse is obvious.
We will need the useful identities (13.146) and (13.153) from Section 13.6
for any Jordan matrix X, which can be veriﬁed by direct computation. We
also have the remarkable fact that
A ∗A = 0 = B ∗B =⇒(A ∗B) ∗(A ∗B) = 0
(14.110)

which follows by polarizing (13.146),11 and which ensures that the set of
Jordan matrices satisfying (14.108), consisting of all real multiples of ele-
ments of the Cayley plane, is closed under the Freudenthal product.
In the Dirac formulation of quantum mechanics, a quantum mechanical
state is represented by a complex vector v, often written as |v⟩, which is
usually normalized such that v†v = 1. In the Jordan formulation [17,29,30],
the same state is instead represented by the Hermitian matrix vv†, also
written as |v⟩⟨v|, which squares to itself and has trace 1 (compare (14.105)).
The matrix vv† is thus the projection operator for the state v, which can
also be viewed as a pure state in the density matrix formulation of quantum
mechanics. The phase freedom in v is no longer present in vv†, which is
uniquely determined by the state (and the normalization condition).
A fundamental object in the Dirac formalism is the probability ampli-
tude v†w, or ⟨v|w⟩, which is not however measurable; it is the squared
norm |⟨v|w⟩|2 = ⟨v|w⟩⟨w|v⟩of the probability amplitude which yields the
measurable transition probabilities. One of the basic observations leading
to the Jordan formalism is that these transition probabilities can be ex-
pressed entirely in terms of the Jordan product of projection operators,
since
(v†w)(w†v) = tr (vv† ◦ww†).
(14.111)
A similar but less obvious translation scheme also exists [17] for transition
probabilities of the form |⟨v|A|w⟩|2, where A is a Hermitian matrix, cor-
responding (in both formalisms) to an observable, so that all measurable
quantities in the Dirac formalism can be expressed in the Jordan formalism.
So far, we have assumed that the state vector v and the observable A
are complex. But the Jordan formulation of quantum mechanics uses only
the Jordan identity
(A ◦B) ◦A2 = A ◦

B ◦A2
(14.112)
for two observables (Hermitian matrices) A and B. As shown in [30], the
Jordan identity (14.112) is equivalent to power associativity, which ensures
that arbitrary powers of Jordan matrices—and hence of quantum mechan-
ical observables—are well-deﬁned.
The Jordan identity (14.112) is the deﬁning property of a Jordan alge-
bra [29], and is clearly satisﬁed if the operator algebra is associative, which
11The necessary fact that det(A + B) = 0 follows from the deﬁnition (11.15) of the
determinant in terms of the triple product, the cyclic properties of the trace of the triple
product, and the assumptions on A and B.

186
The Geometry of the Octonions
will be the case if the elements of the Hermitian matrices A, B themselves
lie in an associative algebra. Remarkably, the only further possibility is the
Albert algebra of 3 × 3 octonionic Hermitian matrices [30,38].12
14.10
The 3-Ψ Rule13
An essential ingredient in the construction of the Green–Schwarz super-
string [39,40] is the spinor identity
ϵklmγµΨkΨlγµΨm = 0
(14.113)
for anticommuting spinors Ψk, Ψl, Ψm, where ϵklm indicates total antisym-
metrization. This identity can be viewed as a special case of a Fierz rear-
rangement. An analogous identity holds for commuting spinors Ψ, namely
γµΨΨγµΨ = 0.
(14.114)
It is well-known that the 3-Ψ Rule holds (only) for Majorana spinors
in three dimensions, Majorana or Weyl spinors in four dimensions, Weyl
spinors in six dimensions, and Majorana–Weyl spinors in ten dimensions.
Thus, the Green–Schwarz superstring exists only in those cases [39,40]. For
the same reason, the only Yang–Mills theories with minimal supersymmetry
occur in dimensions 3, 4, 6, and 10 (see for instance [41]).
Several authors [4, 42, 43] discussed the relationship of vectors and
spinors in these dimensions to the four division algebras, R, C, H, O. As
was shown by Fairlie and Manogue [44], the 3-Ψ Rule in all of these cases
is equivalent to an identity on the γ-matrices, which holds automatically
for the natural representation of the γ-matrices in terms of the four divi-
sion algebras, corresponding precisely to the above four types of spinors.
Manogue and Sudbery [45] then showed how to rewrite these spinor expres-
sions in terms of 2 × 2 matrices over the appropriate division algebra, thus
eliminating the γ-matrices completely.
We show here that the 3-Ψ Rule is in fact equivalent to an associator
identity over the division algebras.
Let U, V , W be arbitrary octonionic vectors, that is, 1 × n octonionic
matrices. The vector associator
[U, V, W] = (UV †)W −U(V †W)
(14.115)
12The 2×2 octonionic Hermitian matrices also form a Jordan algebra, but, even though
the octonions are not associative, it is possible to ﬁnd an associative algebra which leads
to the same Jordan algebra [30,31].
13The material in this section is adapted from the appendix of [22].

The Physics of the Octonions

satisﬁes
[W, V, V ] ≡0
(14.116)
which is established by direct computation using alternativity.
Setting
W = V yields
[V, V, V ] ≡0.
(14.117)
Essentially the same argument establishes a similar formula when W is
replaced by an octonionic scalar λ, namely
[λ, V, V ] = 0
(14.118)
where we have implicitly deﬁned yet another associator, namely
[λ, V, W] = (λV †)W −λ(V †W).
(14.119)
An interesting consequence of this result is the Hermitian conjugate relation
V †(V λ) = (V †V )λ
(14.120)
which has applications to the right eigenvalue problems considered in Chap-
ter 13.
We can polarize (14.116) to obtain
[U, V, W] + [U, W, V ] ≡0
(14.121)
a special case of which is
[V, V, W] + [V, W, V ] ≡0
(14.122)
obtained by setting U = V . A further special case of (14.121) is
[U, V, W] + [U, W, V ] + [V, W, U]
+ [V, U, W] + [W, U, V ] + [W, V, U] ≡0
(14.123)
obtained by adding cyclic permutations of (14.121), or, without requir-
ing (14.116), by repeated polarization of (14.117).
In the commuting case, the (unpolarized) 3-Ψ Rule can be written in
terms of a 2-component octonionic “vector” (really a spinor) V as [36]

(V V †) V = 0
(14.124)
where
A = A −tr A
(14.125)
corresponding to time reversal. It is straightforward to check that (14.124)
holds by alternativity, or by using the identity
tr (V V †) = tr (V †V ) = V †V ∈R
(14.126)

188
The Geometry of the Octonions
to write

(V V †) V = (V V † −V †V ) V = (V V †)V −V (V †V ) = [V, V, V ]
(14.127)
and we see that the 3-Ψ Rule for commuting spinors is just (14.117).
Equivalently, we can rewrite the (polarized) 3-Ψ Rule in terms of
2-component “vectors” U, V , W as
(
UV † + 
V U †) W + ( 
V W † + 
WV †) U + ( 
WU † + 
UW †) V = 0.
(14.128)
Using the identity
tr (UV † + V U †) = tr (V †U + U †V ) = V †U + U †V
(14.129)
we have

UV † + 
V U † = (UV † + V U †) −(U †V + V †U)
(14.130)
where the last term is Hermitian and hence real. We thus have
(
UV † + 
V U †)W = (UV † + V U †)W −W(U †V + V †U)
(14.131)
which implies that (14.128) is precisely the same as (14.123).
An analogous argument can be given for anticommuting spinors; this
is essentially the approach used in [36]. Combining these results, the 3-Ψ
Rule can be written without γ-matrices in terms of 2-component octonionic
spinors ψα as
[ψ1, ψ2, ψ3] ± [ψ1, ψ3, ψ2] + [ψ2, ψ3, ψ1]
± [ψ2, ψ1, ψ3] + [ψ3, ψ1, ψ2] ± [ψ3, ψ2, ψ1] = 0
(14.132)
for both commuting (+) or anticommuting (−) spinors. Both of these iden-
tities follow from the identity (14.117) applied to 2-component octonionic
vectors, which is a special case of the more general identity (14.116) that
holds for octonionic vectors of arbitrary rank.

The 2 × 2 Magic Square
In Section 9.2, we showed that the groups SU(2, K) are
SU(2, R) ∼= SO(2),
(15.1)
SU(2, C) ∼= SO(3),
(15.2)
SU(2, H) ∼= SO(5),
(15.3)
SU(2, O) ∼= SO(9),
(15.4)
for K = R, C, H, O, respectively (and where all congruences are local, that
is, up to double cover). Similarly, in Section 9.3, we showed that the groups
SL(2, K) are
SL(2, R) ∼= SO(2, 1),
(15.5)
SL(2, C) ∼= SO(3, 1),
(15.6)
SL(2, H) ∼= SO(5, 1),
(15.7)
SL(2, O) ∼= SO(9, 1).
(15.8)
Finally, combining results from Sections 7.5, 8.2, and 9.4, we showed that
Sp(4, R) ∼= SU(2, H′) ∼= SO(3, 2),
(15.9)
Sp(4, C) ∼= SU(2, 2) ∼= SO(4, 2).
(15.10)
There is a pattern here, which correctly suggests that
Sp(4, H) ∼= SO(6, 2),
(15.11)
Sp(4, O) ∼= SO(10, 2),
(15.12)
as shown in Table 15.1. This table has some remarkable properties. Looking
at the three columns labeled by R, C, and H, there is a symmetry between

Corresponding groups, such as SO(3) and SO(2, 1),
have the same dimension, and are in fact merely diﬀerent real forms of the
same group. Furthermore, comparing (15.3) with (15.9) leads us to suspect,
again correctly, that the rows can perhaps be labeled with the split division
algebras.
These symmetries also lead us to suspect that there should be a fourth
row in Table 15.1, and a uniﬁed description of all of these groups at once.
We provide such a description in Section 15.2.
15.2
The Geometry of SU(2, K′ ⊗K)1
The groups in Table 15.1 are all orthogonal groups.
What is the pat-
tern to their signatures?
Let’s go ahead and label the rows with the
split division algebras, as shown in Table 15.2. Let κ = |K| = 1, 2, 4, 8,
and for K′ keep track separately of the number of positive-normed basis
units, κ′
+ = 1, 1, 2, 4, and negative-normed basis units, κ′
−= 0, 1, 2, 4, with
κ′
+ + κ′
−= |K′|. Then the groups in the table are just SO(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−)! So
we need a representation of SO(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−).2 The orthogonal groups are
closely related to spinors and Cliﬀord algebras, and we can translate this
standard relationship into the language of division algebras.
We choose as a basis for the octonions O the unit elements
{ea, a = 1 . . . 8} = {1, i, j, k, kℓ, jℓ, iℓ, ℓ}
(15.13)
and similarly for the split octonions O′ the unit elements
{ea, a = 9 . . . 16} = {1, I, J, K, KL, JL, IL, L}.
(15.14)
In what follows, the split quaternions H′ have basis {1, K, KL, L}, the split
complex numbers C′ have basis {1, L}, and of course R′ = R.
1The material in this section is adapted from [12].
2Throughout this section, we continue to use SO(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−) to refer to its double
cover, the spin group Spin(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−).

We will work with the algebra O′ ⊗O and its subalgebras K′ ⊗K, where
K is any of the division algebras R, C, H, O, and K′ any of their split
versions. Elements of O′ ⊗O are simply (sums of) products of elements of
O′ and O, such as “jK”. We assume that O and O′ commute with each
other, that is, that
aA = Aa
(15.15)
for all a ∈O, A ∈O′, and we will therefore usually write elements of O
before elements of O′.
15.2.1
The Cliﬀord Algebra Cℓ(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−)
We consider matrices of the form
X =
A
a
a −A∗

(15.16)
with A ∈K′ and a ∈K. Then X can be written as
X = xaσa
(15.17)
where there is an implicit sum over the index a, which takes on values
between 1 and 16 as appropriate for the case being considered. When not
stated otherwise, we assume K′ = O′ and K = O, as all other cases are
special cases of this one. Equation (15.17) deﬁnes the generalized Pauli
matrices σa, which are given this name because σ1, σ2, and σ9 are just
the usual Pauli spin matrices.
We deﬁne the determinant of X in the obvious way, namely
det X = −AA∗−aa = −|A|2 −|a|2.
(15.18)
The collection of matrices of the form X forms a normed vector space of
signature (κ + κ′
+, κ′
−), using (−1 times) the determinant as the norm. We

can therefore identify the resulting vector space with Rκ+κ′
+,κ′
−.3
We now consider the 4 × 4 matrix
P =

(15.19)
where tilde represents trace reversal,

X = X −tr(X) I,
(15.20)
and where the gamma matrices Γa are implicitly deﬁned by (15.19). The
only σa which are aﬀected by trace reversal are those containing an imag-
inary element of K′, which are imaginary multiples of the identity matrix.
A straightforward computation using the commutativity of K with K′ now
shows that
{Γa, Γb} = 2gabI
(15.21)
where I is the identity matrix and
gab =

(15.22)
is the metric. These are precisely the anticommutation relations necessary
to generate a representation of the (real) Cliﬀord algebra Cℓ(12, 4) in the
case of O′ ⊗O, and Cℓ(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−) in general.
However, Cliﬀord algebras are associative, so our algebra must also be
associative.
Since the octonions are not associative, neither are matrix
groups over the octonions, at least not as matrix groups. The resolution
to this puzzle is to always consider octonionic “matrix groups” as linear
transformations acting on a particular vector space, and to use composi-
tion, rather than matrix multiplication, as the group operation. This con-
struction always yields an associative group, since composition proceeds in
a ﬁxed order, from the inside out.
3There is a similar construction using matrices of the form
X′ =
„A
a
a
A∗
«
which have some remarkable properties. As a vector space, of course, the collection of
such matrices provides another representation of Rκ+κ′
+,κ′
−. But matrices of this form,
unlike those of the form (15.16), close under multiplication; not only do such matrices
satisfy their characteristic equation, but the resulting algebra is a Jordan algebra.

Magic Squares
193
Let’s start again.
The Cliﬀord identity that we need to verify is
not (15.21) itself, but rather the action of (15.21) on (linear combinations
of) products of gamma matrices, such as Γc. So we need to establish that
Γa (ΓbΓc) + Γb (ΓaΓc) = 2gabΓc.
(15.23)
If
the
associator
of
the
corresponding
units
vanishes,
that
is,
if
[ea, eb, ec] = 0, then (15.23) reduces to (15.21), so we only need to con-
sider cases where the associator is nonzero. But in this case an extra minus
sign is required in each term on the left-hand side of (15.23) in order to
factor out Γc, which changes nothing since both sides are 0. This argument
establishes (15.23), and it is easy to see that the argument still holds if Γc is
replaced by any product of gamma matrices. Thus, the linear transforma-
tions {Γa} do indeed generate a Cliﬀord algebra, namely Cℓ(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−).
15.2.2
The Orthogonal Group SO(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−)
Representations of Cliﬀord algebras normally lead to representations of the
corresponding orthogonal groups, using a well-known construction, so we
expect Cℓ(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−) to lead us to a representation of SO(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−);
we show here that it does.
However, our use of nonassociative division
algebras in our representations requires some modiﬁcations to the standard
construction.
In the associative case,
the homogeneous quadratic elements of
Cℓ(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−) act as generators of SO(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−) via the map
P −→M abP M −1
ab
(15.24)
where
M ab = exp

−ΓaΓb


(15.25)
and P = xaΓa as above. So we consider ﬁrst the case where [ea, eb, ec] = 0,
with a, b, c assumed to be distinct.
Then the original Cliﬀord iden-
tity (15.21) implies that
ΓaΓa = ±I,
(15.26)
(ΓaΓb)Γc = Γc(ΓaΓb),
(15.27)
(ΓaΓb)Γb = (Γb)2Γa = gbbΓa,
(15.28)
(ΓaΓb)Γa = −(Γa)2Γb = −gaaΓb,
(15.29)
(ΓaΓb)2 = −Γ2
aΓ2
b = ±I.
(15.30)

(15.31)
From (15.26), if a = b, then M ab is a real multiple of the identity matrix,
which therefore leaves P unchanged under the action (15.24). On the other
hand, if a ̸= b, properties (15.27)–(15.29) imply that M ab commutes with
all but two of the matrices Γc. We therefore have
ΓcM −1
ab =

M abΓc,
c = a or c = b
M −1
ab Γc,
a ̸= c ̸= b
(15.32)
so that the action of M ab on P aﬀects only the ab subspace. To see what
that action is, we ﬁrst note that if A2 = ±I then
exp (Aα) = I c(α) + A s(α) =

I cosh(α) + A sinh(α),
A2 = I
I cos(α) + A sin(α),
A2 = −I
(15.33)
where the second equality serves to deﬁne the functions c and s. Insert-
ing (15.32) and (15.33) into (15.31), we obtain
M ab

xaΓa + xbΓb

(15.34)
Thus, the action (15.24) is either a rotation or a boost in the ab-plane,
depending on whether
(ΓaΓb)2 = ±I.
(15.35)
More precisely, if a is spacelike (gaa = 1), then (15.24) corresponds to a
rotation by θ from a to b if b is also spacelike, or to a boost in the a direction
if b is timelike (gbb = −1), whereas if a is timelike, the rotation (if b is also
timelike) goes from b to a, and the boost (if b is spacelike) is in the negative
a direction.
If K′ ⊗K = H′ ⊗H (or any of its subalgebras), we’re done: Since
transformations of the form (15.24) preserve the determinant of P , it is clear
from (15.18) that we have constructed SO(6, 2) (or one of its subgroups).
What about the nonassociative case? We can no longer use (15.27),
which now contains an extra minus sign. A diﬀerent strategy is needed.

Magic Squares
195
If ea, eb commute, they also associate with every basis unit, that is
[ea, eb] = 0 =⇒[ea, eb, ec] = 0
(15.36)
and the argument above leads to (15.34) as before. We therefore assume
that ea, eb anticommute, the only other possibility; in this case, ea, eb
are imaginary basis units that either both lie in O, or in O′. As before,
we seek a transformation that acts only on the ab subspace. Consider the
transformation
P −→eaP e−1
a
(15.37)
which preserves directions corresponding to units eb that commute with ea,
and reverses the rest, which anticommute with ea. We call this transforma-
tion a ﬂip about ea; any imaginary unit can be used, not just basis units.
If we compose ﬂips about any two units in the ab plane, then all directions
orthogonal to this plane are either completely unchanged, or ﬂipped twice,
and hence invariant under the combined transformation. Such double ﬂips
therefore aﬀect only the ab plane.
The rest is easy. We nest two ﬂips, replacing (15.24) by

and we have constructed the desired rotation in the ab plane.

The Geometry of the Octonions
We also have
ΓaΓb = −eaeb I
([ea, eb] ̸= 0)
(15.45)
so in the associative case (with ea, eb anticommuting), we have

which diﬀers from Mab only in replacing θ by −θ (and an irrelevant overall
sign) if gaa = −1. In other words, the nested action (15.38) does indeed
reduce to the standard action (15.24) in the associative case, up to the ori-
entations of the transformations. In this sense, (15.38) is the nonassociative
generalization of the process of exponentiating homogeneous elements of the
Cliﬀord algebra in order to obtain rotations in the orthogonal group.
We therefore use (15.24) if ea and eb commute, and (15.38) if they
don’t. Since both of these transformations preserve the determinant of P ,
it is clear from (15.18) that we have constructed SO(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−) from
Cℓ(κ + κ′
+, κ′
−).
15.2.3
The Group SU(2, K′ ⊗K)
So far we have considered transformations of the form (15.24) and (15.38)
acting on P . In light of the oﬀ-diagonal structure of the matrices {Γa},
we can also consider the eﬀect these transformations have on X. First, we
observe that trace-reversal of X corresponds to conjugation in K′, that is,

σa = σ∗
a.
(15.47)
The matrices ΓaΓb then take the form
ΓaΓb =
σaσ∗
b
0
0
σ∗
aσb

(15.48)
and, in particular,

(15.49)

The 4 × 4 action (15.24) acting on P is thus equivalent to the action
X −→exp

−σaσ∗

θ
2

X exp

σ∗

.
(15.51)
on X.
Transformations of the form (15.38) are even easier, since each of M 1
and M 2 are multiples of the identity matrix I.
These transformations
therefore act on X via
X −→M 2

M 1XM −1
1

M −1
2
(15.52)
where M1, M 2 are given by (15.40), but with I now denoting the 2 × 2
identity matrix.
Since X is Hermitian with respect to K, and since that condition is
preserved by (15.51), we have realized SO(κ+κ′
+, κ′
−) in terms of (possibly
nested) determinant-preserving transformations involving 2 × 2 matrices
over K′ ⊗K. This 2×2 representation of SO(κ+κ′
+, κ′
−) therefore deserves
the name SU(2, K′ ⊗K).
15.2.4
Magic Squares
This construction is reminiscent of the Freudenthal–Tits magic square of
Lie algebras, which is discussed further in Section 15.3. Indeed, Barton and
Sudbery [9] discuss the restriction of the Freudenthal–Tits magic square to
precisely the case considered here, albeit at the Lie algebra level. Their
restricted magic square contains the 16 Lie algebras
v2(K1, K2) = sa(2, K1 ⊗K2) ⊕so(Im K1) ⊕so(Im K2)
(15.53)
where K1, K2 are division algebras (or possibly their split cousins),
sa(n, K1) denotes the anti-Hermitian tracefree n×n matrices with elements
in K1 and so(Im K1) denotes the isometry Lie algebra of the imaginary el-
ements of K1. The algebras R and C have no such isometries, and
so(Im H) = so(3),
(15.54)
so(Im O) = so(7).
(15.55)
We have argued here that the group version of (15.53) is
V2(K1, K2) = SU(2, K1 ⊗K2)
(15.56)
that is, that the groups in this 2 × 2 magic square deserve to be called
SU(2, K1 ⊗K2). We have presented the construction above only for the
“half-split” case, with K1 = K′ and K2 = K, which, as already noted, has
interesting applications to physics, but the other two cases (“non-split” and
“double-split”) are similar.

15.3
The 3 × 3 Magic Square
The Freudenthal–Tits magic square was originally given in terms of Lie
algebras [33,46]; the version shown in Table 15.3 lists instead particular real
forms of the corresponding Lie groups. Vinberg [47] later gave a symmetric
parametrization of the Lie algebras v3(K1, K2) in this magic square in the
form
v3(K1, K2) = sa(3, K1 ⊗K2) ⊕der(K1) ⊕der(K2)
(15.57)
where K1, K2 are division algebras (or possibly their split cousins),
sa(n, K1) denotes the anti-Hermitian tracefree n × n matrices with ele-
ments in K1 and der(K1) denotes the derivations of K1, which are the Lie
algebra version of automorphisms. The division algebras R and C have no
derivations, and
der(H) = so(3),
(15.58)
der(O) = g2.
(15.59)
Thus, the only change in the Vinberg construction between the 2 × 2 and
3 × 3 cases is the use of g2 rather than so(7) in the octonionic case, a
diﬀerence that can be attributed to the lack of triality in the 2 × 2 case.
This magic square again possesses a symmetry between rows and
columns; corresponding groups are again diﬀerent real forms of the same
group. But the most remarkable property of the Freudenthal–Tits magic
square is that it contains four of the ﬁve exceptional Lie groups—and the
ﬁfth, G2, appears implicitly as part of the Vinberg construction.
The Vinberg construction also suggests that the groups in the
Freudenthal–Tits magic square can be described as SU(3, K′ ⊗K), by anal-
ogy with the 2 × 2 case considered in Section 15.2. This construction is
indeed possible, but is beyond the scope of this book.
