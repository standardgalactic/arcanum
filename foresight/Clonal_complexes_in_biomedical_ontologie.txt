PREFACE 
Ontologies are being used in a variety of ways by researchers in almost every life science discipline, 
and their use in annotation of both clinical and experimental data is now a common technique in 
integrative translational research. When data from different sources are described using shared, 
logically structured, controlled vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology (GO), this makes the data more 
easily retrievable and navigable, and it also enhances the degree to which they can be analyzed and 
combined to serve new purposes. 
Two major international conferences on Standards and Ontologies for Functional Genomics (SOFG), 
held at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, UK in 2002 and at the University of 
Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, PA in 2004, have thus far been devoted to the topic of 
biomedical ontology. They served to bring together researchers involved in the development and use of 
ontologies in addressing the data annotation needs created by the new high-throughput experimental 
techniques and new applications of comparative genomics in the investigation of human biology and 
disease. 
In the years since SOFG, the number of applications of ontologies in biomedicine has expanded 
greatly, and so also has the range and functionality of associated software tools. The Web Ontology 
Language (OWL) serves as a central enabling technology of the Semantic Web, which is itself 
increasingly being used to serve computational biomedical research in reflection of the growth of the 
Internet as a medium for data exchange. Ontologies are now being used in almost every domain of 
biomedical research, including translational medicine, drug discovery, clinical trials, neuroimaging, 
environmental studies, evolutionary biology, and many other fields. Ontologies have been developed to 
describe data at all scales, from molecular pathways to mammalian anatomy and from protein 
modifications to infectious disease. 
Increasingly, it is recognized that these different ontologies need to work together in order to maximize 
the degree to which they can serve the needs of researchers and clinicians, and it is the recognition of 
this need that led to the organization of the International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO) in 
Buffalo on July 24-26, 2009.  
ICBO brings together scientists and informaticians developing and using ontologies across the entire 
spectrum of biology and clinical and translational medicine. It represents a continuation not only of the 
SOFG series but also of multiple dissemination events organized under the auspices of the National 
Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), an NIH Roadmap Center for Biomedical Computing. We 
acknowledge the financial support of the NCBO, and also of the University at Buffalo College of Arts 
and Sciences, the National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR), and the National Human Genome 
Research Institute through award number R13 HG005049-01.

An OWL-DL Ontology for Classification of Lipids

Abstract 
Lipids can be systematically classified according to 
functional 
properties, 
structural 
features, 
biochemical origin or biological system. However 
Lipid nomenclature has yet to become a robust 
research tool since no rigorous definitions exist for 
membership of specific lipid classes. Lipids need to 
be defined in a manner that is systematic yet at the 
same time semantically explicit. We report on the 
reuse of existing lipid nomenclature, ontology 
describing chemical structure and the extension of 
the OWL-DL Lipid Ontology to support the 
classification of lipid molecules. We applied 
definitions, DL-axioms, to describe lipids classes and 
illustrate suitability of the ontology for the 
classification of Fatty Acyl lipids and Mycolic acids. 
Introduction 
IUPAC-IUBMB proposed a systematic nomenclature 
for lipids which received limited adoption by the 
lipid community. The proposed classification was 
complicated and prone to erroneous application by 
scientists. Moreover the naming scheme was not 
extended and does not adequately represent many 
novel lipid classes discovered in the recent decades. 
As a result lipids still lack systematic classification 
and a nomenclature that is universally adopted by the 
biomedical research community. The LIPIDMAPS 
consortium1 aims to resolve this by introducing a 
scientifically robust, comprehensive and extensible 
classification system evolved from the IUPAC 
nomenclature. This classification scheme organizes 
lipids from different phyla and synthetic domains yet 
uptake by the lipid community has been slow and the 
literature is steeped with instances of lipid synonyms 
that fail to reflect the new nomenclature.  
Hierarchical Classification of Lipid Nomenclature 
Lipids 
are 
organic 
compounds 
and 
can 
be 
systematically 
classified 
according 
to 
various 
features e.g. atomic connectivity, physicochemical 
properties, presence of functional groups, or types of 
bioactivities. Albeit an important contribution, the 
LIPIDMAPS central repository of lipids has 
primarily used is-a relationships2 to categorize lipids 
and many definitions describing LIPIDMAPS lipid 
classes remain implicit. Moreover they are often 
dependent on a chemical diagram in the form a 
molecular graphic file that can only be accurately 
classified by a trained lipid expert. No rigorous 
definition, independent of a graphical diagram, exists 
and the graphical definitions are not flexible, nor are 
they extensible. Changes in such definitions require 
the redrawing of the chemical diagram/definition. 
Subsequently, 
communicating, 
storing 
and 
transferring of such structural definitions in the 
current format is inefficient and there is much 
reliance on trained experts. There is therefore a need 
for lipids to be defined in a manner that is systematic 
and explicit. A rigorous definition would involve a 
minimal necessary and sufficient declaration for class 
membership that could adequately describe a lipid 
without requiring a molecular structure diagram. 
Description logics (DL) describe a domain using 
class descriptions according to a logic based 
semantic. In previous work DL has been used to 
represent chemical knowledge3,4. Using DL, it is 
possible to define a lipid with necessary conditions 
such that an alpha mycolic acid is defined as a lipid 
that 
minimally 
has 
alpha-hydroxyl 
acid 
and 
cyclopropane groups. Moreover, we can define 
necessary and sufficient conditions limiting the 
definition of an alpha mycolic acid to a lipid that has 
only 
alpha-hydroxyl 
acid 
and 
cyclopropane 
functional groups. Consequently molecules that have 
functional groups other than alpha-hydroxyl acid 
group and cyclopropane groups cannot be considered 
as an alpha mycolic acid.

The Lipid Ontology 
The Lipid Ontology was exclusively developed to 
conceptualize and capture knowledge in the domain 
of lipids through the use of concepts, relations, 
instances and constraints on concepts5. It was 
designed to provide a common terminology for the 
3

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lipid domain, a basis for interoperability between 
information systems and to support navigation of text 
mining results from lipid literature. The ontology has 
been 
extended 
to 
describe 
the 
LIPIDMAPS 
nomenclature 
classification 
explicitly 
using 
description logics (OWL-DL) and to support 
reasoning and inference tasks. Prior to extending the 
ontology for classification tasks we reviewed existing 
chemo-ontologies6,7 for reusable components. We 
reviewed the Chemical Ontology6 for reuse of 
functional group specifications in the Organic_Group 
hierarchy. We enriched the Lipid Ontology with 32 
functional groups from Chemical Ontology and 63 
new concepts were added under the Organic_Group 
super-concept. The Organic_Group hierarchy was 
reorganized and asserted with new is-a relationships. 
From Chemical Ontology, we also used hasPart to 
relate concepts of lipids to concepts under 
Organic_Group. In reviewing the ChEBI7 Ontology 
we identified that it is currently undergoing major 
revisions to correct inconsistent use of ‘IsA’ and 
‘IsPartOf’ properties. We opted not to re-use its 
organization and relationship definitions, moreover 
to represent a systematic lipid nomenclature using 
formal logical definition of classes, we do not yet 
need all the relationship definitions found in ChEBI 
To further facilitate the reuse of the formal 
definitions in the lipid ontology we provide a high 
level alignment to ChEBI using SAMBO12. The 
alignment is available online at: 
http://www.lipidprofiles.com/LipidOntology/Others/SA 
MBO_0.rdf 
Functional Groups Used in Lipid Classification  
Lipids can have a wide range of distinct functional 
organic groups that should be accommodated in their 
conceptualization 
and 
classification. 
Distinct 
combinations of these organic groups underpin the 
definitions of lipid classes and membership of lipid 
classes can be restricted by formal descriptions which 
refer to functional groups. While the Chemical 
Ontology6 describes basic functional groups, a wider 
range of functional groups are needed to describe 
lipids. To equip the Lipid Ontology for use as a 
classification tool we added 400 DL definitions to all 
lipid classes, with the exception of polyketides (Table 
1). Primarily we re-used, from Chemical Ontology, 
the 
axiom 
“Organic_Compound 
hasPart 
Organic_Group” 
to 
relate 
Lipid 
concepts 
to 
Organic_Group concepts. We then defined concepts 
to 
describe 
lipid 
functional 
groups, 
namely 
Organic_Group and Ring_System. Organic_Group 
has three sub-groups (i) Simple_Organic_Group, (ii) 
Complex_Organic 
_Group, 
(iii) 
Chain_Group. 
Simple_Organic_Group subsumes concepts that 
describe 
basic 
functional 
groups 
whereas 
Complex_Organic_Group encapsulates glycans and 
amino acids. Glycans, in particular, are used to 
classify lipids such as sacharrolipids, and other 
sugar-linked 
lipids 
such 
as 
sphingolipids. 
Chain_Group consists of the Carbon_Chain_ Group 
and 
the 
Sphingoid_Base_ 
Chain_Group. 
The 
Sphingoid_ Base_Chain_Group is used exclusively 
for sphingolipids whereas Carbon_Chain_ Group is 
applied to other lipid classes accordingly. The 
Ring_System 
consists 
of 
(i) 
Isoprenoid_ring_ 
derivative, (ii) Monocyclic_Ring_ Group and (iii) 
Polycyclic_Ring_System. These concepts are used to 
define lipids that have one or more rings, primarily 
sterol, prenol and other ring lipids. In Lipid Ontology 
these concepts are extensively used to provide the 
necessary structural descriptions to define the 
identity of lipid-based compounds.

Table 1. Summary of the current Lipid Ontology 
Hierarchical Classification of Lipids 
Lipid concepts are organized hierarchically with the 
super-classes 
restricted 
by 
generic 
necessary 
conditions. More specific necessary conditions are 
used to define membership requirements for sub 
classes of lipid. At the end of a hierarchy, lipid 
classes are restricted by necessary and sufficient 
conditions and closure axioms. Super-classes are not 
closed by closure axiom to avoid inconsistency 
among disjointed sibling classes. More specific lipid 
classes are defined in two ways. In the first approach 
we specify the subclass of the present class to restrict 
the definition of a lipid. Necessary conditions such as 
“hasPart some Carboxylic_Acid_derivative_ Group” 
can be further specified by the subclass of 
Carboxylic_Acid_Derivative_Group, e.g. aldehyde. 
The second approach uses a Cardinality Axiom that 
restricts the number of a particular concept to be 
allowed in a restriction. Lipid classes can be defined 
by the number of certain functional group concept or 
Chain_Group concept. For example, a triacylglycerol 
is an acylglycerol with 3 acyl chains. Its superclass is 
restricted with an existential axiom “has some Acyl_ 
Chain”. This is further specified with the following 
cardinality axiom “hasAcyl_Chain exactly 3”. We are 
currently exploring Qualified Cardinality Axioms in 
4

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
OWL 2.0 as a means of defining lipid classes. For 
example we can define the class Triacylglycerol with 
“hasPart exactly 3 Acyl_Chain” without additional 
properties such as hasAcyl_Chain. However, an 
Acyl_Chain would have a carboxylic acid functional 
group encapsulate within it. When defining lipids 
with “hasPart exactly 3 Acyl_Chain”, care must be 
taken not to add functional groups that entail others. 
DL Axioms for the definition of Fatty_Acyl 
Fatty acyls are a diverse lipid group synthesized by 
chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with 
malonyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA 
groups1. 
We 
define a fatty acyl as a lipid that has at least one 
Carboxylic_Acid_derivative_Group and at least one 
Acyl_Chain. Docosanoid is a subclass of fatty acyls 
that 
inherits 
from 
Fatty_Acyl 
class 
the 
Carboxylic_Acid_derivative_Group 
as 
well 
as 
Acyl_Chain. 
The 
Carboxylic_Acid_derivative_ 
Group in Docosanoid is further specified to be a 
Carboxylic_Acid, 
whereas 
the 
Acyl_Chain 
is 
specified with a cardinality axiom and the property 
hasAcyl_Chain. 
Consequently, 
Docosanoid 
is 
defined to have only 1 Acyl_Chain. In addition, 
Docosanoid can have multiple and distinct functional 
groups such as Carboxylic_Acid, Alkenyl_Group, 
Alcohol and Cyclopentenone. These functional 
groups are associated with the class Docosanoid via 
the property “hasPart” in conjuction with the 
existential axiom “some”. A closure axiom is needed 
to restrict the type of relationship constraints allowed 
for a lipid class. The closure axiom is applied to the 
class Docosanoid so that lipids of this class can only 
have the following functional groups, namely, 
Carboxylic_Acid, 
Alkenyl_Group, 
Alcohol, 
Cyclopentenone and Acyl_Chain. (Figure 2). As 
LIPIDMAPS nomenclature classifies lipids based on 
Figure 2. DL-definitions of Alpha_mycolic_acid,  
Fatty_alcohol and Docosanoids  
chemical structure or biosynthetic origin, lipids such 
as fatty alcohols are classified as fatty acyls in spite 
of having no Acyl_Group. When considered 
structurally, this classification of lipids is not 
systematic. 
We 
address 
this 
shortcoming 
in 
LIPIDMAPS 
nomenclature 
by 
expanding 
the 
definition of Fatty_Acyl to include Alkyl_Chain, a 
characteristic structure of un-usual Fatty_Acyl 
classes. In doing so a Fatty_alcohol inherits an 
Alkyl_Chain from Fatty_Acyl and is further defined 
to have a single Alkyl_Chain in the necessary and 
sufficient condition. This definition includes a 
“hasPart” property that connects Fatty_alcohol to an 
Alcohol class allowing inclusion of a lipid without an 
acyl group as a member of Fatty_Acyl (Figure 2). In 
addition we create a new lipid class, namely 
Fatty_Acyl_derivative, a subclass of Fatty_Acyl. 
Using the flexibility of OWL-DL, we can begin to 
address 
inconsistencies 
in 
lipid 
classification 
grounded in lipid definitions that are non systematic.  
Extension of the Mycolic Acid Class 
Mycolic acids are a key component of the cell wall of 
Mycobacterium tubeculosis sps. and are implicated 
mycobacterial disease. By 1998 there existed 500+ 
known chemical structures of related mycolates8 and 
yet LIPIDMAPS currently contains only 3 mycolic 
acid records. Consequently many mycolic acids with 
known structures have yet to be systematically 
classified. Classification of these lipids is critical for 
system-level analysis of mycobacterial pathogenesis. 
We illustrate extension of Lipid Ontology to include 
new 
Mycolic_Acid 
classes 
and 
demonstrate 
classification of a real instance of an alpha mycolate 
(Figure 1) to the appropriate class. Based on 
LIPIDMAPS nomenclature, we assign Mycolic_acid 
as a member of Fatty_Acid and extend Mycolic_acid

classification to 9 defined subclasses (Table 2 
http://www.lipidprofiles.com/LipidOntology/Others/T 
able2.jpg), 
distributed 
among 
three 
primitive 
superclasses. Alpha mycolic acid is a mycolic acid 
that has cyclopropane and alpha-hydroxyl acid (a 
special class of carboxylic acid) groups. The 
carboxylic acid group is a member of the acyl group, 
an ester group. Therefore, according to the 
classification scheme below, alpha mycolic acid must 
be a member of Fatty_Acyl. Among members of 
Fatty_Acyl, 
only 
Octadecanoid, 
Docosanoid, 
Eicosanoid and Fatty_Acid have carboxylic acid. 
Alpha mycolic acid does not have a cycloketone 
group and therefore, it cannot be Docosanoid, 
Eicosanoid or Octadecanoid and must be a member 
of Fatty_Acid. Among members of Fatty_Acid, only 
Mycolic_acid has an Alpha-Hydroxy_Acid_Group 
and a Meromycolic_ Chain. Therefore, alpha mycolic 
acid is classified under this class of Fatty_Acid. Since 
Alpha_mycolic_acid is the only class that accepts 
mycolic acid with Cyclopropane, the lipid in Figure 1 
is classified as a member of Alpha_mycolic_acid. 
(Figure 2). 
Conclusion 
Lipid research is increasingly integrated within 
systems level biology such as lipidomics9 where lipid 
definition and classification are required before 
annotation of chemical functions can be applied. In 
this paper we have sought to address the ongoing 
challenge of classifying lipids through the adoption 
of W3C standard knowledge representation and the 
application of DL axioms. In other domains of 
metabolomics, e.g. glycomics, the adoption of 
ontologies such as, GlycO – a focused ontology 
representing complex carbohydrates, have enabled 
correlation of structural features of glycans to the 
biosynthesis and metabolism10. We initiated the 
process of defining lipids according to appropriate 
functional groups with the intent of using the 
ontology for classification of lipids. Ontology driven 
classification has been applied to proteins11 and small 
molecules6 through the coordination of protein 
domain or pharmacophore analysis, OWL-DL 
ontology, and DL reasoning. By adding precisely 
defined DL-axioms to the lipid ontology we can 
apply a similar approach for the automated 
classification of lipids. Our approach is extensible to 
accommodate novel lipids and we extended the use 
of DL-axioms to classify all lipid classes (except for 
polyketides). In support of mycobacterial disease 
research, we extended lipid nomenclature and 
classification of mycolic acids. We have made 
available systematic and formalized OWL-DL 
definitions of lipids for testing the appropriateness of 
existing nomenclature to lipid structures. This will 
serve as a reusable standard for lipid researchers and 
the lipid bioinformatics community. The Lipid 
Ontology is available online at NCBO’s Bioportal

Abstract 
Biomedical Ontologies are intended to integrate 
diverse biomedical data to enable intelligent data-
mining and facilitate translation of basic research 
into useful clinical knowledge. We present the first 
version of RNAO, an ontology for integrating RNA 
3D structural, biochemical and sequence data. While 
each 3D data file depicts the structure of a specific 
molecule, such data have broader significance as 
representatives of classes of homologous molecules, 
which, while differing in sequence, generally share 
core structural features of functional importance. 
Thus, 3D structure data gain value by being linked to 
homologous sequences in genomic data and 
databases of sequence alignments. Likewise genomic 
data can increase in value by annotation of shared 
structural features, especially when these can be 
linked to specific functions.  The RNAO is being 
developed in line with the developing standards of 
the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Consortium.  
Introduction 
The aim of the RNA Ontology Consortium (ROC)1 is 
“to create an integrated conceptual framework—an 
RNA 
ontology—with 
a 
common, 
dynamic, 
controlled and structured vocabulary to describe and 
characterize RNA sequences, secondary structures, 
three-dimensional structures and dynamics pertaining 
to RNA function.” Other kinds of experiment that are 
useful to RNA biochemists and bioinformaticists 
include 
chemical 
probes 
and 
thermodynamic 
measurements. Previous work in this field includes 
the RiboWeb ontology,2 which was part of a 
knowledge base for studying the bacterial ribosome, 
the Multiple Alignment Ontology for nucleic acid 
and protein sequences3 and RNAML,4 which is an 
actively-used 
XML 
schema 
for 
exchanging 
information about RNA secondary structures, tertiary 
structures, sequences and sequence alignments. The 
immediate context of the RNA Ontology is the Open 
Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) project,5 which seeks 
to coordinate the development of biomedical 
ontologies. Small molecules are dealt with by 
ChEBI,6 macromolecular sequences (DNA, RNA and 
protein) by the Sequence Ontology7 and proteins by 
the Protein Ontology.8 The RNAO is distinct from its 
neighbors but will share relationships and refer to 
terms from the other ontologies where necessary. 
We set out the paper as follows: we briefly describe 
the chemical structure of the RNA molecule and then 
describe how to represent (1) base pairing and other 
pairwise interactions, (2) motifs and (3) backbone 
conformations based on the hierarchical nature of 
RNA structure. We will also describe the relationship 
to the Sequence Ontology. The RNAO is developed 
using Protégé as an OWL* ontology and is also 
available in OBO format. We illustrate what can be 
done within the limitations of OWL; however a full 
treatment of RNA structure requires first-order logic. 
RNAO is freely available.† 
RNA 
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules consist of 
nucleotide (nt) units, which themselves consist of 
heterocyclic nucleobases covalently bonded to ribose 
rings which are connected covalently to the ribose 
rings of other nucleotides through phosphate groups. 
The combination of base and ribose is called a 
nucleoside. Each nucleoside has three interacting 
edges, the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge 
and the sugar edge as shown in Fig. 1. These edges 
are sets of hydrogen-bond donors and hydrogen-bond 
acceptors located on the same stretch of the boundary 
of the nucleoside. They are illustrated for adenosine 
in Fig. 1. The nucleotide units themselves are linked

connection of the 3' position of a nucleotide to the 5' 
position of the next nucleotide in the chain via the 
phosphate group (see Fig. 1).

We follow Villanueva-Rosales and Dumontier,9 who 
base their ontology on atoms and bonds, but we 
modify their approach by treating the nucleotides as 
the objects and the interactions between them as the 
relations. Thus we have two fundamental relations, 
the 
covalently_bonded_to 
relation, 
and 
the 
pairs_with relation. 
The folding of the RNA chain brings together pairs 
of short sequence segments that are Watson-Crick 
complementary to form anti-parallel double helices 
consisting of stacked Watson-Crick basepairs. 
Helices are the simplest and most regular RNA 3D 
motifs. The set of Watson-Crick paired helices 
comprise the secondary structure of the RNA. Some 
RNA molecules can form more than one secondary 
structure and can be induced by appropriate 
perturbations to switch between them. The looping of 
the chain forms other motifs called hairpin loops, 
many of which are structured by specific sets of 
interactions, including base-pairing and base-stacking 
and often, base-phosphate interactions. Segments of 
sequence joining two helices can also form structured 
motifs called internal loops. Finally, multi-helix 
junction loops result when three or more helical 
segments are joined together. Junction loops provide 
branch points in RNA molecules. RNA 3D motifs 
recur in numerous RNA molecules encoded by genes 
from different families in very different organisms. 
Recurrent 3D motifs often play similar roles in 
different RNA molecules. For example, junction 
loops provide branch points, kink-turn internal loops 
provide flexible hinges and GNRA hairpin loops 
mediate tertiary interactions. Motifs combine to 
define characteristic RNA folds or domains. 
Base Pairing 
We start with the basepair classification proposed by 
Leontis and Westhof,10 which places RNA basepairs 
in distinct, geometrically defined classes that are 
mutually exhaustive and disjoint. The pairwise 
interactions are hydrogen bonds between atoms in 
adjacent nucleosides, and as such we define the 
interactions in terms of edges (see Fig. 1). To a first 
approximation: 
(1) each edge of a nucleoside may interact only with 
a single edge of a different nucleoside 
Because OWL can only handle binary relations, we 
have to specialize the pairs_with relation for each 
combination of interacting edges. With six different 
combinations of edge interaction (WC-WC, H-H, S­
S, WC-H, WC-S and H-S), and two relative 
orientations (cis and trans) for the interaction of the 
nucleosides, there result twelve basepairing classes in 
the Leontis-Westhof scheme and eighteen base 
pairing relations as shown in Table 1 (appendix). We 
can express statement (1) formally by declaring each 
of these relations to be disjoint from other relations, 
which means for example that if X pairs_with_CWH 
Y then there is no Z such that X pairs_with_CWW Z. 
The logical definition for a family 1 base pair is 
written: 
family_1_base_pair = hasPart some (Nucleobase 
and pairs_with_CWW some Nucleobase) 
in OWL Manchester syntax,11 and this is sufficient 
for a reasoner to classify a base pair with the correct 
pairing relation into the correct LW family. 
Motifs 
By specializing the covalently_bonded_to relation 
and pairs_with relation it is possible to create 
rudimentary definitions of most motifs, and it is 
straightforward to generate RNAO-specific first-
order logic representations of a given RNA structure 
from a plain text file. However, because all but the 
very simplest motifs contain cyclically-connected 
nucleotides, and OWL cannot handle cycles, it is 
impossible for this part of the ontology to be 
represented in OWL in such a way that reasoners can 
deal with it. 
Further, it is possible that some motifs will be best 
described by formal definitions, whereas other more

complex motifs may be best described by statistical 
or machine learning approaches. 
Backbone Conformers 
The backbone in RNA molecules is a chain of 
covalently-bonded atoms which are parts either of the 
phosphate group (O5', P, O3') or of the ribose rings 
(C3'-C4'-C5'). We are interested in RNA backbone 
conformations for two reasons: (1) particular RNA 
motifs can also be described as a sequence of 
backbone conformers, and (2) they provide sites for 
catalysis or interaction with ions, proteins, small 
molecules, proteins, and other nucleic acids or 
segments of the same RNA. 
We are using the ROC backbone committee’s 2­
character notation12 for the conformations of suites, 
which are the stretches of backbone between two 
ribose rings. Each of their 54 suite conformers is a 
cluster of datapoints in the 7-dimensional space of 
the backbone dihedral angles. Suites and nucleotides 
provide alternative ways to partition the RNA 
molecule, but we are exploring whether the ontology 
can simply treat suite conformers as qualities of the 
covalent connection between nucleotides. 
RNAO and the Sequence Ontology 
The Sequence Ontology (SO) is a structured 
controlled 
vocabulary 
for 
the 
description 
of 
biological sequence. SO is used by model organism 
genome communities for the annotation of genomic 
sequence and will provide the basic terms to describe 
sequence features for RNAO.  SO will be extended to 
provide terms to describe discontiguous regions. This 
will be necessary to describe many secondary and 
tertiary structural motifs.  SO also includes a number 
of RNA motif terms that will be transitioned to 
RNAO. 
Conclusions 
We have presented a rudimentary version of RNAO 
which contains logical definitions that can be used by 
a reasoner to classify base pairings into the twelve 
categories of Leontis and Westhof and outlined how 
to 
incorporate 
3D 
motifs 
and 
backbone 
configurations into the ontology. We have also 
shown what can be done in OWL for interoperability 
with other OBO ontologies and what needs to be 
represented in first-order logic.

Abstract 
The Sequence Ontology is undergoing reform to meet 
the standards of the OBO Foundry. Here we report 
some of the incremental changes and improvements 
made to SO. We also propose new relationships to 
better define the mereological, spatial and temporal 
aspects of biological sequence.  
Introduction 
The Sequence Ontology1 was begun in 2003 as a 
means to provide the terms and relations that obtain 
between terms, to describe biological sequence. The 
main purpose being the unification of the vocabulary 
used in genomic annotations, specifically genomic 
databases and flat file data exchange formats. 
Genomic data has been notoriously unspecified with 
a multitude of file formats expressing the same kind 
of data in different ways. Each gene prediction 
algorithm for example, exported the gene models in 
either a different format from other groups, or when 
they used the same format, the terms often had 
slightly different meanings. 
Data integration 
between groups was therefore not straightforward. 
Likewise, validation of annotations relied on the 
programmers understanding the nuances of each kind 
of annotation and hard-coding their programs to 
match. The Sequence Ontology provides a forum for 
the genomic annotation community to discuss and 
agree on terminology to describe their biological 
sequence. 
The SO was initially divided into aspects to describe 
the features of biological sequence and the attributes 
of these features. A sequence feature is a region or a 
boundary of sequence that can be located in 
coordinates on biological sequence. SO uses a 
subsumption hierarchy to describe the kinds of 
features 
and 
meronomy 
to 
describe 
their 
containment. Features were related by their genomic 
position. For example polypeptides and transcripts 
are described by genomic context. This excluded 
their post-genomic topology. 
The SO has a large user community of established 
model organism databases and newer ‘emerging 
model organism’ systems who rely on the GMOD2 
suite of tools to annotate and disseminate their 
genetic information. GMOD schemas and exchange 
formats rely on the SO to type their features such as 
the Chado database3, with its related XML formats 
and the tab delimited flat file exchange format 
GFF34. Several GMOD tools use GFF3, for example 
GBrowse5. SO is also used by genome integration 
projects such as Flymine6, modENCODE7 and the 
BRC pathogen data repository8. There are other uses 
for SO such as natural language processing initiatives 
that use the SO terminology9,10. 
The SO is one of the original members of the OBO 
Foundry11. The OBO ontology developers agreed to a 
set of shared principles for formal ontology design, 
with the aim of achieving orthogonal, interoperable 
ontologies. There are 10 principles for OBO Foundry 
membership which include a common syntax, a data­
versioning system, collaborative development, and 
adherence to the same set of defined relationships12. 
The OBO ontology developers attempt to accurately 
represent reality. Membership in the OBO Foundry 
represents a commitment to adhere to the ontology 
design principles and agree to reform where 
necessary. The OBO Foundry spans the biomedical 
domain in steps of granularity from the molecule to 
the population. It also encompasses the relations to 
time. Continuants endure through time, where as 
occurrents, which include processes, unfold through 
time in stages. The sequence features of SO are 
instantiated as molecules or parts of molecules. 
The SO has orthogonal neighbor ontologies within 
the OBO Foundry, also describing molecular 
continuants. Chemical entities of Biological Interest 
(ChEBI) 
is 
a 
dictionary 
of 
small 
chemical 
compounds13. It does not describe molecules encoded 
by the genome such as transcripts and peptides. The 
RNA Ontology14 describes the secondary and tertiary 
motifs of RNA as well as providing relationships 
between bases for base pairing and stacking. The 
Protein Ontology (PRO) defines the forms of 
proteins and the evolutionary relationships between 
protein families15. It is natural for these ontologies to 
interact and create inter-ontology terms in the form of 
cross products. To do so, the ontologies must all 
adhere to the same principles.  
Coordinated Reform of SO to OBO Standards 
The SO, like other pre-exisiting ontologies has begun 
to undergo reform to meet the OBO Foundry 
standards.

Textual Definitions 
New terms are now defined using OBO Foundry 
guidelines for definitions. The existing terms in SO 
were initially either defined by a member of the 
developer community, or via a cross reference to a 
reputable source. This has lead to inconsistency 
between the definitions, and sometimes inconsistency 
between the definition and placement of the term. 
The OBO Foundry recommends that terms be 
defined with respect to the is_a parent, and the 
attributes that differentiate the term from its parent 
and sibling terms, called the differentiae. This 
practice forces a self check on the whether the 
position of the term in the ontology agrees with the 
defined meaning of the term. New definitions in SO 
must adhere to the “A is_a B that C’s” principle. For 
example, the new term, vector_replicon, a subtype 
of replicon, has the following definition: A replicon 
that has been modified to act as a vector for foreign 
sequence. Existing terms are undergoing a refinement 
process. 
Logical Definitions 
In addition to providing text definitions, the SO 
includes over 100 ‘cross-product’ definitions in 
genus/differentiae form16. A reasoner can then be 
used to place the terms in the correct place in the 
ontology. This is especially useful as it untangles the 
graph for editing purposes. The SO is released in two 
forms, either with the logical definitions, or fully 
classified for use without a reasoner.  
Parthood Relations 
The SO must adhere to the principles of OBO 
Relations Ontology (RO). The RO provides a set of 
defined formal type level and instance level relations. 
The list of relations may be extended by individual 
ontologies as required. The class level relations 
follow the “ALL_SOME” rule17. This rule is 
necessary to improve the ability to reason over data 
that uses the ontology. In practice, making these 
changes to SO has required the addition of the 
‘has_part’ relation to the ontology. Prior to this 
change the SO stated that: 
TATA_box part_of RNApol_II_promoter and 
TATA_box part_of RNApol_III_promoter. 
This was incorrect as all TATA_boxes are not part of 
both kinds of promoter. The ontology now states that: 
RNApol_III_promoter has_part TATA_box. 
The integral_part_of relation and its inverse have 
been added to clarify the occasions when the part and 
the whole must both exist. 
Temporal Relations and Spatial Interval Relations 
There are several kinds of relation that are needed to 
describe the complex nature of biological sequence. 
Mereological relations are needed to describe 
containment. Spatial relations are needed to relate the 
positional 
information 
about 
features. 
Each 
transformation of sequence requires a temporal 
relation. Finally as SO is part of a larger suite of 
ontologies, it will need relations with which to make 
cross products and refer to other ontologies. We 
propose to extend SO with the relations outlined in 
Table 1. 
Biological sequence is predominantly instantiated in 
three kinds of polymeric molecule: DNA, RNA and 
polypeptide, although man-made polymers such as 
PNA do exist. The SO will represent the 
transformation of sequence from one kind of 
molecule to another using the temporal relations 
shown in Table 1. A gene, manifest in DNA 
transcribed_into the primary_transcript, which is 
expressed as RNA. A polypeptide sequence is a 
translation_of the CDS sequence. Transcript 
molecules also undergo processing such as splicing 
and editing which remove or add additional 
sequences. 
The 
relations 
processed_from 
and 
processed_into relate the primary transcript to its 
mature processed  form. 
It is important to understand how the proposed 
changes will affect the annotation community who 
already use the terms and relations of SO in their 
pipelines and processes. This will effect how the 
changes are released. The terminology used to type 
the features already in use will not change. The GFF3 
format will be unaffected as it lists the feature types 
and the parent term of a given relation. It does not 
name the relation – this is maintained in the ontology.  
Developers will need to be given notice of new 
relationships and structures however, as this may 
have adverse effects of pipelines and programs.  
The proposed changes to the SO relationships and 
structure can be found on the SO website at the 
following address:

Table 1. New relations proposed for SO. Definitions are for instance level relations, examples are for class-level relations,  
which follow from the instance-level definition in the standard all-some pattern. 
Conclusions 
The updates to the SO, based on OBO Foundry 
recommendations have strengthened the ontology as 
a tool for reasoning. The treatment of definitions 
enforces a tight regulation on the position of a new 
term in the ontology and synchronizes the textual 
definition within the subsumption hierarchy. The 
process of updating all of the definitions is ongoing. 
Stricter adherence to the OBO Relations Ontology is 
making SO interoperable with the other OBO 
ontologies. The SO uses a reasoner to maintain the 
is_a parents of cross product terms. This aids 
ontology maintenance and can be used as a model for 
other OBO ontologies. 
The application of sequence features that span the 
range of the molecular biology central dogma, rather 
than simply the position of the genomic region that 
encodes the molecule, is a subtle but important step

forward. It allows the topological relations at each 
stage from genome to transcript or peptide to be 
catalogued. It roots the SO within OBO making cross 
products between the sibling ontologies possible. 
The addition of a suite of mereological, topological 
and temporal relations will dramatically enhance the 
ability to use the SO as a tool for computational 
reasoning. Each of the new defined relationships 
adds another avenue for analysis. This is especially 
important for the validation of sequence annotations 
using SO.

ChemAxiom – An Ontological Framework for Chemistry in Science 
Nico Adams, Edward O. Cannon, Peter Murray-Rust  
Unilever Centre for Molecular Science Informatics, University Chemical Laboratory,  
University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK  
Abstract 
We present ChemAxiom as the first ontological 
framework for chemistry in science. ChemAxiom 
enables discourse about chemical objects in a 
computable language and is useful for the 
management of chemical concepts and data, the 
retrospective typing of resources, the identification of 
ambiguity and supports chemical text mining. 
Ontology in Chemistry – Current State of the Art 
Chemistry is a central scientific discipline and at the 
heart of a number of other important sciences such as 
biomedical research. While the latter has derived 
tremendous benefit from the development of 
controlled vocabularies, taxomomies and ontologies 
for the annotation of biological knowledge and text, 
chemistry has been slow to adopt these technologies 
and remains, on the whole, an ontological wasteland, 
although Batchelor and others have made excellent 
cases for the use of (formal) ontological methods in 
chemistry.1, 2 
There have been several attempts to apply 
ontological techniques to the field of chemistry in the 
past. Currently, the most widely used ontology in 
chemistry is the “Chemical Entities of Biological 
Interest” 
(ChEBI) 
ontology.3 
ChEBI 
contains 
ontological associations, which specify chemical 
relationships as well as the biological roles and 
applications of a molecule. A recent study by 
Batchelor showed, that ChEBI contains a substantial 
amount of implicit and disguised semantics, which 
significantly complicates its use in modern semantic 
information systems.1 Other notable ontologies in the 
chemistry domain are the Chemical Ontology,4 REX5 
and FIX,6 which model physicochemical processes 
and methods respectively, as well as ChemTop, 
which is a subset of the BioTop ontology.7 Though 
valuable for annotation, none of these efforts can be 
considered to constitute an ontological framework for 
chemistry. 
Case for Formal Ontological Methods in Chemistry 
Chemical 
information 
systems 
and 
resource 
discovery in chemistry are often predicated on the 
use of chemical structure (connection table) as an 
identifier and as annotation for chemical data. This 
springs from the “central dogma” of chemistry, 
namely, that molecular structure is correlated to the 
physico-chemical 
and 
biological 
properties 
of 
chemical entities. While this practice has served a 
subsection of the chemical community relatively 
well, there are major problems: first and foremost, 
the use of a connection table as a chemical identifier 
leads to a fundamental ontological confusion 
between the universal “molecule” and a “real world” 
bulk substance. Yet, in many information systems, a 
physicochemical 
property 
of 
a 
substance 
is 
associated with the structure of a molecule. It does 
not make sense to speak of a melting point in terms 
of a molecule. Many physicochemical quantities are 
properties of the mereological sums of the molecules, 
which make up the substance and not properties of 
the molecules themselves. In practice, this almost 
always leads to “lossy” encoding of information and 
information compartmentalisation. Formal ontology 
can help by providing a clear distinction between the 
abstract notion of a molecule and a bulk substance as 
might be in use in the laboratory. A similar argument 
can be made for many identifiers: in many 
information systems, it is not clear whether the 
identifier applies to a molecule or the substance. 
Many chemical entities have dynamic structures (e.g. 
rapidly interconverting isomers - glucose dissolved in 
water) and cannot be described by one structural 
representation alone, i.e. there exists a parthood 
relationship between a given chemical entity and the 
corresponding several structures that can be written. 
Furthermore, there is a dependence on the notion of 
time: the fluxional structure of a chemical entity is a 
function of time. Ontology can assist in defining and 
specifying both these parthood relationships as well 
as the time dependence. 
Materials and formulations, too, can be composites of 
several molecular entities or other chemical entities, 
which, in turn can be composites. Moreover, the 
“history” (e.g. synthesis conditions, post-processing 
etc.) of a material often has a significant impact on its 
physical properties, which are not captured by simple 
structural annotation. 
By adopting formal ontological methods, we can 
clarify ambiguous meanings: if, for example, text 
mining has identified the term “acid” in a piece of 
text, then it is not clear whether this refers to a 
molecule acting as an acid or a chemical substance (a 
bottle of acid). If, however, the term “pH” has also 
15

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been identified in this context, a formal ontology 
could indicate that the concept “acid” refers to a 
substance rather than a molecule. When applied in 
this way, an ontology can be used to “retrospectively 
type” chemical objects – in this example into 
chemical substance or molecule. 
The ChemAxiom Set of Ontologies 
To address some of the points discussed above and to 
fill the ontological void that currently exists in the 
chemical domain, we have developed ChemAxiom – 
a set of separately maintainable, but interoperable 
and integrated ontologies (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. The ChemAxiom set of ontologies. 
Each ontology describes a particular aspect of the 
chemical domain and collectively the ontologies form 
a framework for the description of chemistry. In 
designing ChemAxiom, we have borrowed from 
many bioscience ontologies such as the OBO family, 
ChEBI and MeSH and have derived some advantage 
from the fact that chemical concepts have clearer 
boundaries than biological ones. Consequently, 
ChemAxiom has been designed to (a) contain no 
implicit semantics, (b) be useful for the management 
of both chemical concepts and chemical data, (c) 
allow retrospective typing of chemical objects and 
the identification of ambiguity, (d) allow for 
undecideability either because of lack of knowledge 
or lack of axiomatisation and (e) allow for community 
extensibility and interoperability. Currently, the main 
use case for the ChemAxiom ontologies is the 
description of chemical data contained in documents 
of different types as well as machine output and the 
ability to support machine-generated RDF. We will 
present a formal evaluation of the ontologies w.r.t. 
this use case in further work. ChemAxiom 
complements other ontologies in the chemical field, 
which focus on, for example, compound taxonomy 
and biological function (ChEBI) or chemical structure 
(CO).4 ChemAxiom has been prepared in the OWL 
language and is currently under active development, 
funded in part by both Unilever plc as well as the 
Dutch Polymer Institute. We are currently exploring 
the possibility of forming a broad platform around 
the ontologies with a number of partners and 
explicitly invite and value community participation in 
the development process. All ontologies are available 
at http://www.bitbucket.org/na303.  
There are currently several ontology modules, which 
are integrated via the Basic Formal Ontology8 as an 
upper ontology. ChemAxiomChemDomain is a small 
ontology which clarifies some fundamental concepts 
in chemistry, such as the parthood relationships 
between molecule and substance as well as generic 
roles which molecules and substances can assume. 
ChemAxiomProp currently contains a list of over 
150 chemical and materials properties, together with 
definitions of symbols (where appropriate or 
available) and axioms for typing (see below). 
ChemAxiomMetrology is an ontology of over 200 
measurement techniques and also contains a 
framework for instruments (though currently required 
metadata such as measurement conditions or 
specification of minimum information requirements 
are not included – this will be added at a later stage). 
It 
follows 
the 
same 
modeling 
pattern 
as 
ChemAxiomProp and thus also allows for typing of 
objects. ChemAxiomPoly and ChemAxiomPolyClass 
contain terms, which are in common use across 
polymer chemistry and materials science as well as a 
taxonomy of polymers in terms of generic chemical 
structure. 
ChemAxiomMeta 
will 
allow 
the 
specification of the provenance of chemical data and 
information. 
ChemAxiomContinuants, 
finally, 
represents the integration of all of these sub-
ontologies into an ontological framework for 
chemical continuants. Classes in all ontologies have 
natural language definitions (which have been 
omitted in the examples shown in this paper). Further 
ontologies will include ontologies of chemical 
reactions and experiments as well as specifying 
minimum information requirements for properties 
and measurement methods. We now illustrate some 
of the capabilities of the framework using a number 
of select examples. 
Clarifying Parthood Relationships and Roles 
Key concepts in the ChemAxiomChemDomain 
ontology are ChemicalIdentifier, ChemicalElement, 
MolecularEntity and ChemicalSpecies. We employ 
the IUPAC definitions of MolecularEntity and 
ChemicalSpecies and understand the former to be a 
“constitutionally 
or 
isotopically 
distinct 
atom, 
molecule, ion, […] etc., identifiable as a separately 
distinguishable entity”, whereas a ChemicalSpecies is 
understood to be “an ensemble of chemically

identical molecular entities”. Following Batchelor’s 
suggestion, 
we 
map 
ChemicalElement, 
MolecularEntity and ChemicalSpecies into the BFO 
as subclasses of snap:Object.1 
ChemDomain:ChemicalSpecies  
a 
owl:Class ;  
rdfs:subClassOf snap:Object ;  
rdfs:subClassOf  
[ a     owl:Restriction ;  
owl:onProperty  
ChemAxiomProp:hasProperty ;  
owl:someValuesFrom  
ChemAxiomProp:Property  
] ;  
rdfs:subClassOf  
[ a     owl:Restriction ;  
owl:onProperty  
ChemDomain:presentInAmount ;  
owl:someValuesFrom xsd:string  
] ;  
rdfs:subClassOf  
[ a     owl:Class ;  
owl:unionOf ([ a  
owl:Restriction ;  
owl:onProperty ChemDomain:hasPart ;  
owl:someValuesFrom ChemDomain:MolecularEntity  
] [ a  
owl:Restriction ;  
owl:onProperty ChemDomain:hasPart ;  
owl:someValuesFrom  
ChemDomain:ChemicalSpecies  
])  
] ;  
owl:disjointWith ChemDomain:MolecularEntity ,  
ChemDomain:ChemicalIdentifier ,  
ChemDomain:ChemicalElement .  
ChemicalSpecies, in turn, is composed of (hasPart) 
MolecularEntity(s) or other ChemicalSpecies. This 
crucial distinction now allows “real world” bulk 
substances (e.g. polymers, formulations, an amount 
of benzene in a bottle) to be modeled and kept 
ontologically distinct from the notion of the universal 
“molecule”. Concepts such as Solvent, Catalyst or 
Acid are subclasses of either ChemicalSpecies or 
MolecularEntity as appropriate and are modeled in 
terms of roles: a Solvent is a ChemicalSpecies which 
has a role of SolventRole. While ChemAxiom makes 
parthood relationships specific, it is not easy to see 
how this can be reconciled with the current de facto 
use of many chemical identifiers, which are 
interchangeably applied to both molecules and 
substances (e.g. CAS numbers). If there is a unique 
molecular indentifier, such as InChI may be, then the 
identifier for the substance (URI) may be viewed as 
an aggregation of all the identifiers of the discrete 
molecular entities which are part of the substance. 
For materials, such as polymers, the situation is even 
more complex as it is difficult to discern a single 
uniqueness criterion: uniqueness in materials is often 
dependent on a material’s history and context and it 
may be the case that several URIs may be required 
for the same material. This is an important question 
and subject to ongoing research. 
Typing of Chemical Objects and Resources 
ChemAxiomProp contains the central class Property 
(subclass of snap:SpecificallyDependentContinuant). 
Property has two types of subclass, NamedProperty, 
which is a primitive class and contains a list of 
concrete properties, which, too, are primitive. The 
other subclasses are mostly defined classes and 
represent categorizations in the domain. One 
NamedProperty, for example, is the MeltingPoint, 
which carries the following axiomatisation: 
:MeltingPoint  
a 
owl:Class ;  
rdfs:subClassOf :NamedProperty ;  
rdfs:subClassOf  
[ a     owl:Restriction ;  
owl:onProperty :hasType ;  
owl:someValuesFrom  
:ThermophysicalProperty  
] ;  
rdfs:subClassOf  
[ a     owl:Restriction ;  
owl:hasValue "m.p."^^xsd:string ;  
owl:onProperty :hasSymbol  
] .  
In addition to being a direct rdfs:subClassOf 
:NamedProperty, MeltingPoint is a also a subclass of 
the 
anonymous 
class 
“hasType 
some 
ThermophysicalProperty” (l. 4-7). The defined class 
“ThermophysicalProperty”, in turn, is modeled as the 
intersection of the two classes “Property” and 
“everything that is of type ThermophysicalProperty” 
(l. 5-12 below): 
:ThermophysicalProperty  
a 
owl:Class ;  
rdfs:label "Thermophysical properties"@en ;  
rdfs:subClassOf :Property ;  
owl:equivalentClass  
[ a     owl:Class ;  
owl:intersectionOf (:Property [ a  
owl:Restriction ;  
owl:onProperty :hasType  
;  
owl:someValuesFrom  
:ThermophysicalProperties  
])  
] .  
Therefore, a reasoner will be able to infer that a 
MeltingPoint 
is 
also 
a 
subclass 
of 
ThermophysicalProperty. This is an example of both 
ontology normalization and retrospective typing; 
while all classes have asserted single inheritance, 
multiple inheritance can be inferred and maintained 
via a reasoner (ontology normalisation). Reasoning 
of this type can easily be accomplished using 
reasoners such as Pellet. Furthermore, we do not 
assert deep hierarchies – rather we allow a user to 
construct their own taxonomies using a combination 
of axioms and defined classes. If, for example, text-
mining were to discover the term “melting point”, it 
could retrospectively be typed and therefore 
annotated as a ThermophysicalProperty or a 
NamedProperty. 
Typing could be part of a larger system, in which a 
new “perspective” (i.e. a view onto a contextual 
reality, which need not be universally shared and may 
vary substantially and even conflict with other defined 
perspectives) can be constructed. This definition can 
17

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be implemented a posteriori without needing to re-
code the data. Typing of this sort is informing our 
object-oriented code generation in physical science 
applications. ChemAxiomProp does not yet contain 
notions of dimensionality, nor a subdivision of 
properties into qualities and dispositions. This is the 
subject of future development work. 
Management of Chemical Data – Data in RDF 
ChemAxiomContinuants 
is 
the 
result 
of 
the 
integration of all the sub ontologies discussed so far, 
and facilitates the modeling of chemical objects and 
data in RDF. We show how this can be done by 
creating an instance of the NamedChemicalSpecies 
benzene in ChemAxiomContinuants: 
:benzene  
a 
ChemDomain:NamedChemicalSpecies ;  
ChemAxiomProp:hasProperty  
:Density_1 , :BoilingPoint_1 ;  
ChemDomain:hasPart :benzeneMolecule .  
:BoilingPoint_1  
a 
ChemAxiomProp:BoilingPoint ;  
ChemAxiomProp:hasValue  
"80.1"^^xsd:string ;  
:measuredBy Metrology:Ebulliometry .  
:Density_1  
a 
ChemAxiomProp:Density ;  
ChemAxiomProp:hasValue  
"0.8786"^^xsd:string .  
:benzeneMolecule  
a 
ChemDomain:MolecularEntity ;  
ChemDomain:hasIdentifier  
:MolecularFormula_1 , :CASNumber_1 .  
:CASNumber_1  
a 
ChemDomain:CASNumber ;  
ChemDomain:hasValue "71-43-2"^^xsd:string .  
:MolecularFormula_1  
a 
ChemDomain:MolecularFormula ;  
ChemDomain:hasValue "C6H6"^^xsd:string .  
In future work we will use the ontologies to describe 
data and chemical entities extracted from papers, 
theses and other sources of chemical information 
using our OSCAR3 entity extraction system. When 
coupled with the ability of retrospective typing of the 
extracted information, this opens the door to 
document classification and faceted search.9 
Conclusions 
The adoption of ontological methods in the chemistry 
domain is lagging far behind that of other disciplines. 
However, the integration of biomedical and chemical 
data is important for the future progress of science. 
We have developed a set of ontologies that enables 
the description and typing of chemical objects and 
data in a semantically rich way. This work should go 
some way towards facilitating the integration of data 
from other scientific disciplines with chemical data.

A Formal Ontology of Sequences

Abstract 
The Sequence Ontology is an OBO Foundry ontology 
that provides categories of sequences and sequence 
features that are applied to the annotation of 
genomes. To facilitate interoperability with other 
domain ontologies and to provide a foundation for 
automated inference, we provide here an axiom 
system for the Sequence and Junction categories in 
first- and second-order predicate logics.  
Introduction 
Biological sequences play a major role in genetics 
and bioinformatics research. They are important in 
the description of DNA, RNA and proteins. To 
describe sequences and their features semantically, 
the Sequence Ontology (SO)2 was developed. 
The SO distinguishes between sequence features, 
qualities of sequences, operations on sequences and 
sequence variants. A sequence feature is an extended 
or non-extended biological sequence. Extended 
sequence features are regions such as genes, 
intergenic regions or sequences of polypeptides. 
Non-extended sequences are called junctions – the 
boundaries 
between 
two 
extended 
sequences. 
Operations on sequences include insertions and 
deletions. Qualities of sequences include whether or 
not a sequence encodes a protein, whether a sequence 
acts enzymatically when transcribed, or whether the 
sequence is conserved. Although some formal 
definitions are available for the SO categories, most 
categories are defined using English. 
Formal ontologies are intended to specify a 
conceptualization of a domain5, and therefore provide 
the foundation for data and information integration 
and exchange. Definitions alone are insufficient to 
achieve this goal. Axioms are required to provide 
meaning for primitive, undefined categories. To 
formalize the basic categories used in the SO, several 
ontological questions about sequences must be 
answered, among them: What kind of entity is a 
biological sequence and how does it relate to 
categories in a top-level ontology? What are the 
properties of biological sequences? What relations 
are applicable to sequences? How do sequences 
relate to other kinds of entities, in particular to 
molecules, organisms or processes (of selection, 
mutation)? 
Here we provide an axiom system for the SO's top-
level categories. We use first- and second-order 
logics for this purpose. The axiom system is intended 
to serve as a foundation for the SO, and as a means to 
achieve interoperability between the SO and other 
domain ontologies through the provision of an 
explicit formalization of the basic categories and 
relations used in the context of sequences. For the 
construction of the axiom system, we employed the 
axiomatic method.8 
Method 
We consider a formal ontology to be a specification 
of a conceptualization, i.e., a particular view on the 
world5. A formal ontology uses a vocabulary whose 
terms denote concepts and relations which refer to 
things in reality. 
One method that is used to specify the meaning of a 
term is an explicit definition. An explicit definition 
for a relation or category P  provides a sentence φ  in 
which P does not occur, such that every occurrence 
of P  can be replaced with φ . 
When explaining the meanings of a set of terms 
through explicit definitions, other terms must be used 
to define the terms in the set, and in turn the meaning 
of these terms must be specified (without creating a 
circular 
definition). 
Therefore, 
specifying 
the 
meanings of terms solely through explicit definitions 
will either lead to an infinite regress or leave several 
terms unspecified. In the latter case, the meaning of 
all terms for which a definition is provided depends 
on the meaning of the terms without definition, 
therefore leaving the meaning of all terms in the 
ontology unspecified. 
We call the terms that are not explicitly defined 
primitive terms. The meaning of all terms in the 
ontology depends on the meaning of these primitive 
terms: because non-primitive terms are introduced 
through explicit definitions, every sentence involving 
a non-primitive term can be replaced with a sentence 
containing only primitive terms. 
The problem remains how the meaning of the 
primitive terms can be described formally. We may 
construct 
complex 
sentences 
containing 
only 
primitve terms. These sentences can be understood as 
descriptions of formal interrelations between the

primitive terms. Some of these sentences are chosen 
as axioms: they are accepted as being true within the 
domain under consideration. Such axioms provide 
restrictions on the interpretation of the primitive 
terms, and therefore on the terms defined using these 
primitive terms. For a formal theory, and therefore 
for a formal ontology, the axioms are the central 
component, because only they can give meaning to 
terms used in the theory. 
Results 
The theory of biological symbols and sequences that 
we propose here is intended to be compatible with 
the Sequence Ontology (SO).2 The SO uses two basic 
categories in the characterization of sequences, 
Sequence and Junction. Both can have attributes, i.e., 
properties. For example, a sequence may be a gene or 
a base, a junction an insertion site, and a sequence 
attribute enzymatic. 
Sequences are linear entities and can come in two 
facets. Sequences can either have a start and an end 
point (such as an mRNA sequence), or form circles 
(such as the sequence of mitochondrial DNA). There 
are sequence atoms, which we call Primitive 
biological symbols. Primitive biological symbols 
have no proper sequence parts. 
We introduce an important distinction that is 
currently neglected in the SO. The SO contains as its 
only basic category a sequence region, and employs 
an extensional mereological system on it. However, 
we will show that it is important to distinguish 
between a sequence and the tokens of a sequence. To 
illustrate the difference between a sequence and its 
token, consider all constituents (parts) of the 
sequences ACAC  and CAAC . The first sequence has 
as parts the sequences ACAC , ACA , CAC , AC , 
CA , A  and C . The sequence CAAC  has as parts 
sequences CAAC , CAA , AAC , CA , AA , AC , A 
and 
C . It is remarkable that, although both 
sequences apparently have the same length, use the 
same primitive symbols (only A  and C ), and every 
primitive symbol occurs exactly twice in each 
sequence, ACAC  has seven sequences as part, while 
CAAC  has eight. This is due to the fact that there is 
only one sequence AC , which occurs in ACAC 
twice. On the other hand, each token of ACAC  and of 
CAAC  will have ten parts.  
The theory we propose here assumes that Sequence, 
Molecule, Junction and Abstract sequence are 
primitive categories. In particular, they are not 
defined, but characterized axiomatically. Sequence 
and Junction refer to representations of sequences 
such as those found in biological databases. 
Sequences have tokens which belong to the Molecule 
category. Molecules are material entities which are 
located in space and time. Instances of Sequence 
represent abstract, information bearing entities which 
are instances of Abstract sequence. 
We make no commitment to a particular top-level 
ontology. The ontology of sequences presented here 
can stand on its own, and axioms are presented for all 
relations used in the theory. However, the foundation 
in 
a 
top-level 
ontology 
can 
benefit 
the 
interoperability between the presented ontology and 
other domain-specific ontologies, because the top-
level ontology can provide a common interface for 
multiple domain ontologies. 
The theory is based on these primitives: the 
categories Seq of biological sequences, Jun of 
junctions, Mol of molecules, ASeq of abstract 
sequences, and the relations sPO (sequence-part-of), 
PO (part-of), aPO (abstract-part-of), binds, :: 
(token-of), Rep (representation), between, end and 
conn. 
The first part consists of axioms that restrict the 
arguments of some of the relations.§ Additionally, an 
axiom requiring all sequences to have only molecules 
as tokens is introduced.

Based on the relation sPO, we first define sPPO 
(proper sequence part) and the category of primitive 
biological symbols (PBS) as well as the soverlap and 
sdisjoint relations:  
sPPO(x, y) ↔sPO(x, y) ∧ x =/ y 
(4) 
PBS(x) ↔Seq(x) ∧ ¬∃y(sPPO( y, x)) 
(5) 
soverlap(x, y) ↔∃z(sPO(z, x) ∧ sPO(z, y)) 
(6) 
sdisjoint(x, y) ↔¬soverlap(x, y) 
(7) 
The relation sPO is a parthood relation that holds for 
sequences when one sequence contains the other as a 
sequence part. It satisfies reflexivity, transitivity and 
antisymmetry, and therefore forms a partial order. 
sPO(x, y) ∧sPO(y, z) → sPO(x, z) 
(8) 
Seq(x) →sPO(x, x) 
(9) 
sPO(x, y) ∧sPO( y, x) → x = y

are introduced later.

the 
strong 
supplementation principle, leading to an extensional 
mereology for sequences6: 
¬sPO(x, y) →∃z(sPO(z, x) ∧ sdisjoint(z, y))

Sequences consist entirely of atoms with respect to 
the relation sPO. The following two axioms require 
that all sequences have atoms as part, and that they

Next, we restrict the arguments for the between and

explicit definition.

The following set of axioms pertains to the conn 
relation of connectedness between junctions. It is 
used to represent the order of the sequence through 
an order of junctions.

The axioms presented here are mostly first-order 
axioms and do not suffice to require connectedness of 
sequences. Instead, a second-order axiom is required to 
express the fact that sequences must be connected:  
∀s∀P(∀x(P(x) ↔ in(x, s)) ∧∀Q(∃aQ(a) ∧∀x(Q(x) → P(x)) ∧ 
∀u,v(Q(u) ∧ conn(u,v) → Q(v)) →∀x(P(x) → Q(x)))) 
(24) 
The remaining axioms pertain to molecules, relate 
sequences to their tokens or the abstract sequences 
they represent. They can be found in Hoehndorf 9 and 
in the machine implementation we provide with this 
paper. 
A question that is not answered with these axioms is 
how sequences and junctions relate to categories 
commonly found in the top-level ontology. We believe 
these axioms to be compatible with most major top-
level ontologies, in particular BFO4, DOLCE11 and 
GFO7. However, the foundation in these ontologies 
varies substantially. 
In BFO, sequences and their junctions should be 
considered subcategories of Generically dependent 
continuant. A category A  is generically dependent on 
the category B  if for every instance of A , some 
instance of B must exist. In the framework of the 
BFO, sequences are generically dependent on their 
tokens. The difficulty that arises with such a view is 
that not every sequence is the sequence of a molecule. 
Therefore, the tokens must not be restricted to 
molecules which have the structure specified by the 
sequence, but must include textual and other digital 
representations as tokens of sequences. Junctions, on 
the other hand, always belong to a sequence and 
cannot exist without a sequence. Therefore, junctions 
should be considered as specifically dependent 
continuants which are dependent on sequences. 
In DOLCE, the category Abstract is a sub-category of 
Particular. The main characteristic of abstract entities 
is that they do not have spatial nor temporal qualities, 
and they are not qualities themselves.3 Sequences as 
well as junctions have this property, and the axioms we 
provide can be founded in the DOLCE ontology 
through an addition axioms:  
Seq(x) ∨Jun(x) → dolce : abstract(x) 
(25) 
Integration of our theory in GFO is similar to the 
scenario described in the DOLCE. Alternatively, GFO 
provides the category Symbol structure, to which both 
sequences and junctions can be assigned. Symbol 
structures are higher-order categories in the GFO, and 
the token-of relation ( :: ) falls together with the 
instantiation relation. 
Implementation 
We implemented the axiom system using the SPASS 
first-order theorem prover.12 The implementation can 
be found on our project webpage.10 Due to the 
restriction of SPASS to first-order logic, we could not 
implement the axiom requiring connectedness of 
sequences. This axioms necessitates the use of 
monadic second-order logics. Furthermore, a condition 
that sequences must be finite could not be 
implemented due to the restrictions of first order logic. 
We employed the SPASS theorem prover on our 
axioms and attempted to prove the proposition φ ∧¬φ . 
If this logical contradiction can be derived from the

axioms we provide, our axioms would be inconsistent. 
On the other hand, if our axioms are consistent, we 
expect SPASS to never terminate, because, in the 
general case, an automated consistency proof for first-
order theories is impossible.1 
The SPASS theorem prover could not find a proof for 
the contradictory statement φ ∧¬φ in three weeks 
time. However, this is merely an indication for 
consistency. A formal proof of the consistency, e.g., 
through the construction of a model, is subject to 
future work. 
Conclusion 
We provide an axioms system for sequences, 
junctions and molecules in predicate logics. Most of 
the axioms are available in first-order logic, although 
some require the use of second-order logic. The 
axiom system is intended to serve as a foundation of 
the 
Sequence 
Ontology's 
top-level 
categories 
Sequence and Junction. As a corollary from the 
axiom system, we introduced a class of sequence 
tokens, which we called Molecule. We find that in 
order to understand the category Sequence, it is 
necessary to consider the tokens of a sequence. 
The axiom system we provide is not based on a 
particular top-level ontology, but is compatible with 
multiple top-level ontologies. We discuss how to 
include the theory of sequences in the BFO, DOLCE 
and GFO top-level ontologies. Depending on the top-
level ontology used, sequences and junctions are 
considered different kinds of entities: generically 
dependent continuants in BFO, abstract individuals in 
DOLCE and higher-order categories in GFO. 
This axiom system for sequences is – to the best of 
our knowledge – the first extensive axiom system for 
basic categories of an OBO Foundry ontology. With 
increasing demands for semantic interoperability and 
information flow between OBO Foundry ontologies, 
the importance of developing axiom systems likely 
will increase, because only axioms can provide a 
formal specification of a category's meaning, and 
therefore provide the foundation for automated 
inferences, information flow and integration. The 
new axioms are implemented for the SPASS theorem 
prover and can be downloaded from our website.10

Abstract 
The Cell Ontology (CL) aims for the representation 
of in vivo and in vitro cell types from all of biology. 
Although the CL is a reference ontology of the OBO 
Foundry, it requires extensive revision to bring it up 
to current standards for biomedical ontologies, both 
in its structure and its coverage of various subfields 
of biology. A recent workshop sponsored by NIAID 
on hematopoietic cell types in the CL addressed both 
issues. The section of the ontology dealing with 
hematopoietic cells was extensively revised, and 
plans were set for structuring these cell type terms as 
cross-products with logical definitions built from 
relationships to external ontologies, such as the 
Protein Ontology and the Gene Ontology. The 
methods and improvement to the CL in this area 
represent a paradigm for improvement of the whole 
of the ontology over time. 
Overview 
The Cell Ontology (CL) is an OBO Foundry 
candidate ontology originally built to represent in 
vivo and in vitro cell types, including developmental 
stages, of all the major model organisms.1 The CL 
now aims to become a reference ontology within the 
OBO Foundry.2 The CL both serves the terminology 
needs of data annotation, and provides a base 
ontology from which compound terms in other 
ontologies can be derived by means of cross-product 
term formation.3 At Mouse Genome Informatics, the 
CL is used in conjunction with Gene Ontology (GO) 
annotation of mouse gene products to indicate the 
cell type in which a gene product is active. The GO 
itself uses CL terms in the formation of new GO 
terms: for instance, the GO term “leukocyte 
differentiation” is a cross-product of the CL term 
“leukocyte” with the GO term “cell differentiation.” 
The Cell Ontology is constructed using two 
relationships, is_a and develops_from. The first 
relationship is used to build an ontology of cellular 
subtypes; the latter relationship is used to indicate 
cell lineage relationships. The ontology as it was 
initially developed relied upon a number of artificial 
high level terms to capture types of cellular qualities, 
such as “cell in vivo,” “cell by organism,” and “cell 
by class,” a term which itself has the is_a child terms 
“cell by function,” “cell by histology,” “cell by 
lineage,” “cell by ploidy,” etc. These subclasses of 
cells have further is_a children denoting more 
specific qualities of cells. Depending on the qualities 
of a particular cell type it may have one or more of 
these terms as is_a ancestors. For instance, the well-
defined cell type “erythrocyte” is a type of “erythroid 
lineage 
cell,” 
“oxygen 
accumulating 
cell,” 
“transporting cell,” and “blood cell.” It also has a 
develops_from relationship with “reticulocyte.” 
With its multiple inheritance structure, the original 
CL could be described as having separate ontologies 
of cell types delineated by particular cellular qualities 
overlaid upon each other, i.e. an ontology with 
multiple axes of differentia that are variously and 
sometimes arbitrarily applied to individual cell types. 
Furthermore the high level terms themselves are not 
actual cell types, so the ontology is not a true is_a 
hierarchy. This unwieldy ontological construct is not 
ideal for developing proper inference about cell 
types, nor does it always provide obvious placement 
of new cell type terms. 
Informal discussions among interested parties in the 
past few years have focused on how best to

restructure the CL to eliminate the complexity of its 
multiple inheritance structure with the aim of finding 
a single axis of differentia upon which to base the 
ontology. Participants in these general discussions 
about the CL gradually recognized that no consistent 
differentia such as cellular structure or lineage can 
adequately describe all cell types, and that the best 
solution for biologists is to represent the differences 
and relations between cell types as scientists working 
in various subfields of biology do, depending on their 
specific criteria for differentiating cell types. 
Other criticisms about the CL include the fact that 
many terms do not have definitions or a complete set 
of synonyms. Also, cell types in many subfields of 
biology are poorly represented within the CL. A 
compounding issue has been the lack of a full-time 
curator for the ontology as a whole. Efforts at 
improvement have been made in certain areas of the 
ontology, and hematopoietic cell types in particular 
have been the focus of two rounds of intensive 
curation in recent years. Here we report on these 
revisions and examine the process as an example for 
the future development of the Cell Ontology. 
Hematopoietic Cell Type Revisions 
The first set of improvements for hematopoietic cells 
was done in 2006 in conjunction with the revision of 
the terms for immunological processes in the GO.4,5 
At that time 80 new hematopoietic cell type terms 
were introduced, many other terms were revised, and 
many improvements in ontology structure were made 
for these cell types. 
A second, larger round of revisions to the 
hematopoietic cell type terms in CL is described 
herein. These revisions are the product of a National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) 
sponsored 
“Workshop 
on 
Immune 
Cell 
Representation in the Cell Ontology,” held in May 
2008, where domain experts and biomedical 
ontologists worked together on two goals: 1) revising 
and developing additional specific terms for T cells, 
B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes and 
macrophages, and dendritic cells, and 2) establishing 
a new paradigm for development of the CL. These 
changes in the representation of hematopoietic cells 
were needed to represent these cell types in a more 
complete manner so that all major cell types 
identified in the literature are found in the ontology 
and so that these cell types are defined in an in-depth 
manner that greatly increases the descriptiveness of 
the ontology for data annotation and logical 
inference. 
Methods 
The NIAID workshop attendees discussed both 
specific groups of cell types of interest to 
immunologists as well as how to improve the overall 
ontological structure of these groups and the CL 
ontology in general. The consensus view was that the 
current multiple inheritance structure of the CL is 
unsustainable and that existing and new terms for 
hematopoietic cells should be logically defined via 
their qualities as represented in other ontologies. 
Much discussion centered on what might be the 
optimal axis of differentia for these hematopoietic 
terms. It was recognized in many cases that these cell 
types are defined largely, but not solely, by the 
expression of particular marker proteins either at the 
cell surface (e.g. receptor proteins) or internally (e.g. 
transcription factors). The presence of these proteins 
as part of a cell is considered a structural feature of 
the cell, and participants agreed that the relationship 
has_part from the OBO relationship ontology would 
be used to relate particular cell types to protein terms 
from the Protein Ontology.6,7 
However, for certain cell types, such as macrophages, 
it was seen that the full molecular characterization of 
different types of macrophages is still not complete in 
the literature, and that anatomical location serves as a 
major differentia for these cells. For other cell types, 
functional or lineage criteria serve as differentia for 
the complete definition of the cells. Functional 
criteria include the ability to execute or participate in 
particular GO processes that relate to individual cells, 
such as “cytotoxicity” or “cytokine production,” or 
GO processes that involve coordination of multiple 
cell types, such as “T-helper 1 type immune 
response.” Thus, the participants at the workshop 
agreed to focus on structural criteria where possible 
as the primary differentia, but to accept other types of 
differentia when necessary. This flexibility should 
make it possible to stick to the commonly accepted 
biological definitions of individual cell types and to 
organize the ontology according to sound ontological 
principles while still reflecting organization of 
hematopoietic cell types seen in the literature. 
The primary goal in revising the hematopoietic cell 
terms is to define all the terms according to logical 
definitions based on relationships to external 
ontologies. The workshop participants recognized 
that reaching the full development of these terms as 
cross-products would be difficult at this time due to 
the lack of a full-time curator for the CL. Also, 
external ontologies, such as the Protein Ontology, are 
not yet complete in all the required terms. Yet at the 
same time, the new hematopoietic cell terms are

needed for data annotation and development of cross-
products in the GO and other ontologies. 
Results: A Two-Stage Process 
Reflecting the above considerations, the participants 
at the NIAID workshop agreed upon a two-stage 
approach 
to 
further 
development 
of 
the 
hematopoietic cells in the Cell Ontology. In the first 
stage, which is now complete, current terms were 
revised and new terms added by the experts at the 
workshop. The textual definitions for these terms 
contain all the necessary details to define the cells 
logically. 
These 
terms 
have 
been 
directly 
incorporated into the existing ontology. It was also 
decided to separate the hematopoietic terms from the 
multiple inheritance hierarchy of the original CL as 
much as possible, so that the section of the ontology 
containing these terms represents a true ontology 
hierarchy. This first-stage ontology has been given 
the working name “CL1.5.” Figure 1A shows a 
typical OBO term stanza for one of these new terms, 
“induced T-regulatory cell.” 
The second stage will then be the development of the 
hematopoietic terms into full cross-products as 
discussed above. The extended definitions provided 
in the first step will hopefully enable this to be done 
in a fairly efficient manner depending upon the 
availability of the necessary terms in external 
ontologies. Ideally, this approach will be extended to 
the whole of the CL to create version “CL2.0.” For 
the moment we plan to develop the hematopoietic 
terms of the CL into an external mini-ontology based 
on these cross products, “hemo-CL.” Figure 1B 
shows the OBO term stanza for term “induced T-
regulatory cell” as it will be represented in hemo-CL 
and CL2.0, illustrated graphically in Figure 1C. We 
have already been working with the curators of the 
Protein Ontology to ensure that protein terms needed 
for hemo-CL are found in the Protein Ontology. 
The initial step towards hemo-CL and CL2.0 has 
been taken by Masci and colleagues, who have 
developed a dendritic cell ontology, DC-CL, which is 
based on cross-product principles and is the 
foundation of the revised dendritic cell terms in 
CL1.5.8 DC-CL terms for types of dendritic cells are 
primarily based on structural criteria (surface protein 
expression) with a few cell types also defined by 
relationships to functions or dispositions. DC-CL 
utilizes an expanded range of relationship types 
based on those in the relationship ontology in order

to be more expressive about the cellular location and 
degree of protein expression (has_membrane_part, 
has_high_membrane_amount). It is likely that 
similar relationships will be employed in the 
construction of hemo-CL and CL2.0. 
Specific Improvements in the Representation of 
Hematopoietic Cell Types 
With the work initiated at the NIAID workshop and 
carried on afterwards, many concrete improvements 
to CL content in the area of hematopoietic cells have 
been achieved.  Many new terms for individual cell 
types have been created, including over 40 terms for 
T-lineage cells, over 40 terms for B-lineage cells, 
several natural killer cell terms, over 30 terms for 
monocytes and macrophages, and over 30 terms for 
dendritic cells. Other new terms were introduced for 
various hematopoietic progenitor cell types. As 
discussed above, most of these new terms have been 
defined by structural criteria (protein expression) 
sometimes in conjunction with functional or 
anatomical relationships. The exception to this 
general rule is that most of the new macrophage 
terms are defined based on their anatomical location 
with protein expression criteria added where 
supported by the literature. 
The ontology structure has been improved as well in 
important areas such as T cell and B cell 
development. 
Lineage 
relationships 
via 
the 
develops_from relationship have been provided for 
many 
additional 
cell 
types. 
In 
general 
the 
hematopoietic terms are intended to be species 
neutral, but species-specific information has been 
incorporated in some definitions where necessary and 
comments added to provide clarity to data annotators. 
Discussion 
The Cell Ontology is an essential core component of 
the OBO Foundry and has great potential for aiding 
data annotation and analysis. With the improvements 
described herein, implemented for CL1.5, and 
planned for hemo-CL/CL2.0, we expect the CL to 
fulfill much more of its promise in the area of 
hematopoietic cell representation. The ontology now 
has fairly complete coverage of these cell types in an 
improved hierarchy and using up-to-date molecular 
definitions. These changes will provide for more 
robust inference across the ontology and greater 
utility for annotation of hematopoietic cell type data, 
and will strengthen the use of the CL as a reference 
ontology for cross-product development. 
The workshop approach, aided by an acting editor for 
this section of the ontology, has worked reasonably 
well in carrying out the needed additions and 
revisions in the ontology content in this area, and in 
outlining a clear plan for the future of the ontology. 
The section-by-section approach for improvement of 
defined parts of the Cell Ontology represents a 
paradigm for continued development of the CL and 
should prove even more useful once dedicated 
funding is achieved.

Abstract 
This paper presents the Senselab Neuron Ontology 
(SLNO), a new ontology to describe neuron types and 
their 
properties. 
The 
ontology 
is 
generated 
dynamically from the Senselab databases. The 
project makes extensive use of the new metamodeling 
capabilities offered in OWL 2. This paper also 
discuss the consequences of modeling relationships 
between classes as collections of statements.  The 
SLNO will serve as the basis of the new SWISL web 
application, 
a 
context-aware 
browser 
for 
neurological information on the semantic web. 
Introduction 
In recent years, the semantic web has begun to see 
exploratory use in biomedical research. Scientists 
hope that the terminological precision and logical 
rigor offered by semantic modeling will resolve some 
of the challenges posed by the recent influx of 
diverse biological information. Ontologies may be 
particularly 
helpful 
in 
the 
integration 
of 
heterogeneous data models and the resolution of 
diverse 
nomenclatures. 
These 
issues 
plague 
neuroscience much as they do any area of 
biomedicine5. Two notable recent endeavors are NIF 
(Neuroscience Information Framework)6 and SWAN 
(Semantic Web Application in Neuromedicine)7. The 
NIF project is focused upon producing a controlled 
vocabulary of neuroscience terms and a taxonomy of 
cells and their properties. SWAN, on the other hand, 
hopes to provide an ontology of biomedical 
discourse, a framework for integrating statements 
made in neurological research. 
It is often useful in the process of modeling data to 
make statements about classes of objects in much the 
same way as we would make statements about 
individual objects. This technique is known as 
metamodeling. As a generic example, take the 
statement: “This box contains grapes.” It is clear that 
“this box” should be modeled as an individual, an 
instance of a hypothetical Box class. Less certain is 
how to treat the grapes contained within the box. In a 
certain sense we are treating Grapes as an individual 
object, an instance, suppose, of a Cargo class of 
which other individuals could be Textiles or Treasure. 
This is less than ideal, however, because, in reality, 
Grapes are a class of object. We are not referring to 
the word “Grapes” or to an idealized concept of a 
“Grape.” More importantly, by treating Grapes as an 
individual object we are painting ourselves into a 
corner. If we wish to model Grapes more specifically 
elsewhere in our ontology, to describe, for example, 
individual varieties of grape, or to share data with an 
ontology that does so, we will be unable to associate 
these data with the grapes that are in our box. Thus, it 
is important to preserve the class identity of Grapes.  
In the past, this raised an additional problem. While 
making a statement about a class in the same way 
that one would about an individual is perfectly legal 
in RDF and OWL Full, it was forbidden in the initial 
version of OWL DL, which requires that the pool of 
object names be distinct from the pool of individual 
names. If one wanted to take advantage of the 
features offered by description logic reasoners, a 
workaround was required. The most common 
solution is sometimes referred to as the Relationship 
Transfer Pattern8. In our example, we would define a 
subclass of Box called GrapeBox which would 
contain the restriction that GrapeBoxes contain 
Grapes. Then we define the box we are referring to as 
an instance of the GrapeBox class. Though this 
technique works, it is much less straightforward than 
our original statement. It requires three declarations 
rather than one and if used repeatedly leads to a class 
model that is complicated and difficult to read. 
Although we have used a simple example, the same 
issues arise when one tries to model the fact that a 
specific type of neuron may be found in a specific 
region of the brain. 
Fortunately, versions 1.1 and 2 of OWL DL allow a 
technique called 'punning', whereby class names can 
be treated as individual names9. Although OWL 1.1 
and OWL 2 are not yet official standards, punning is 
already supported by several OWL tools, including 
Pellet10, a widely used reasoner. The Senselab 
Neuron Ontology makes extensive use of punning to 
model statements about neurons and their properties. 
Results 
The Senselab Neuron Ontology (SLNO) is made up 
of two components, a taxonomic part and a data 
descriptive part. The first portion provides a

canonical hierarchy of neurological terms for 
morphology and cellular function. The second 
portion provides a format for statements which make 
use of the foundational terms. A collection of such 
statements culled from research literature is also 
included. This second portion provides us with a 
framework 
from 
which 
we 
can 
determine 
relationships between neurons and their properties. It 
makes use of the punning technique we describe 
above. The foundational portion defines classes and 
properties which build upon the BFO (Basic Formal 
Ontology)11 and RO (Relationship Ontology)12, base 
ontologies which define terms common to all 
knowledge models. For example, the SLNO class 
Neuron is defined as a subclass of the BFO term 
snap:Object, which is turn is defined as a subclass of 
snap:IndependentContinuant. The SLNO property 
has_neuron, which is used to indicate that a 
BrainRegion may hold a particular kind of Neuron, is 
a subproperty of the RO term contains. It is hoped 
that our ontology can be easily integrated with 
ontologies that also build upon these base units such 
as 
the 
OBO 
(Open 
Biomedical 
Ontologies) 
collection13. Thia ontology can be accessed at: 
http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/owl/slno.owl. 
Our ontology is built on top of the well-established 
Senselab project, a collection of databases which 
outline terms for neurological processes and 
categorize recent research under these terms14. 
Individual databases exist for areas such as neurons, 
odor receptors and neuronal models. At present, we 
focus upon NeuronDB, which describes individual 
types of neurons, their structure, their membrane 
properties and where they may be found. Like all of 
the Senselab databases, NeuronDB is regularly 
updated to reflect new domain knowledge. It was of 
great importance to us in designing the SLNO that 
we remain synchronized with Senselab. This 
centralizes update of neurological information and 
allows our ontology to benefit from active curation. 
Data is imported into SLNO using Senselab's EDSP 
format, an XML serialization of the EAV/CR 
database format15. EDSP files consist of two sections. 
The first part uses metadata properties to describe 
class-like objects and their fields. The second fills in 
instances of these classes. Through the use of our 
conversion 
library, 
called 
Senselib, 
the 
data 
structures described in EDSP are converted into a 
graph of Python objects. Each EAV/CR class 
corresponds roughly one-to-one with a python class, 
although there are important divergences between the 
taxonomy of the ontology and that of the original 
NeuronDB. For example, Senselab defines a handful 
of classes for denoting regions of the central nervous 
system: 
GeneralRegion, 
SpecificRegion 
and 
Subdivision. For the SLNO, we found it simpler and 
more intuitive to merge these classes into a single 
hierarchy of subclasses of CNSRegion. 
A handful of core ontology classes are modeled by 
hand as python classes. These base classes include 
Neuron, which is subclassed into Interneuron and 
PrimaryNeuron; CNSRegion; Compartment, a part of 
a neuron; CanonicalForm, which describes what 
compartments may be found in what neurons; and 
MembraneProperty, 
which 
is 
subclassed 
into 
Current, Ion, Neurotransmitter, and Receptor. We 
recognize 
that 
the 
Neurotransmitter 
class 
is 
problematic in that it defines a role rather than a 
category of object. It is very convenient, however, to 
be able to group these entities. Each of these classes 
inherits from a single base class called SLObject 
which 
defines 
three 
common 
properties, 
has_description, has_name and has_senselab_id. 
These properties are populated dynamically from the 
EDSP files. The base python classes are serialized 
into OWL using the rdflib package. All further 
subclasses are added dynamically by parsing EDSP 
files. Individual subclasses are marshaled into 
instances of the core python classes and then 
serialized into OWL classes. The basic properties 
describing Senselab metadata are attached as OWL 
AnnotationProperties. Further properties include a 
neuron_in property which is used to indicate in what 
regions a neuron may be found and a has_neuron 
property to declare what neurons are contained 
within a region. Similar properties are used to 
describe 
the 
relationships 
between 
neuron 
compartments and canonical forms. Most of the 
broader classes are annotated with definitions to 
clarify their meaning within the ontology. Chemical 
entities are further annotated with their ChEBI 
identifiers16. 
The second or, data interchange, component of our 
ontology 
consists 
of 
a 
single 
class 
called 
NeuronPropertyStatement. The OWL ObjectProperties 
describes_neuron, 
describes_compartment 
and 
describes_property are used to hold pointers to the 
particular class to which the statement refers. This is 
accomplished by using the punned name of the class 
as described earlier. An example insertion could be 
expressed using the OWL2 functional syntax as: 
ClassAssertion(NeuronPropertyStatement NA-1)  
SubClassOf(Interneuron Thalamic_reticular_neuron) 
SubClassOf(Compartment Soma) 
SubClassOf(I_Sodium I_Na_p) 
ObjectPropertyAssertion(describes_neuron NA-1 
Thalamic_reticular_neuron) 
28

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ObjectPropertyAssertion(describes_compartment NA-1 
 
Soma) 
ObjectPropertyAssertion(describes_property NA-1 
I_Na_p). 
Other properties are used to provide specifics on the 
the source of the observation and more detailed notes 
about it. An advantage of this approach is that 
individual statements can be associated with 
particular publications. We hope, eventually, to 
represent formally the citations mentioned in the 
notes, using properties from the SWAN ontology. 
Statements 
that 
disagree 
can 
be 
compared; 
observations can be validated or refuted. Querying of 
the statement collection is nearly as straightforward 
as insertion of new data. For example, if we wish to 
know for which neurons, the glutamate receptor 
mGluR2 has been found to be present, we would 
issue the simple SPARQL query:  
select distinct ?n 
where { 
  ?s :describes_neuron ?n .  
  ?s :describes_property :mGluR2_Receptor } 
To issue a more general query such as to find what 
neurons have been found to contain any of the 
glutamate receptors, we would alter our query to take 
advantage of OWL DL subclass inferencing: 
select distinct ?n 
where { 
  ?s :describes_neuron ?n .  { 
    ?s :describes_property :Glutamate_Receptor  
} union { 
    ?s :describes_property ?p .  
    ?p rdfs:subClassOf :GlutamateReceptor }} 
Our decision to model neurological observations as 
individual statements reflects a certain strategic 
tradeoff in that we use ontological terms to describe 
data rather than to attempt a canonical representation 
of reality. The advantages to this approach are not 
limited to practicality, although the format is similar 
to the EAV structure of the Senselab database. New 
statements can be added as information becomes 
available and spurious or conflicting information can 
be easily filtered out. Of course, at some point it may 
become useful for information about what properties 
might be observed in particular neurons to be 
included 
within 
a 
foundational 
ontology 
of 
neurology. Such an ontology could be constructed 
dynamically in a relatively straightforward manner 
by querying the pool of NeuronPropertyStatements 
for results that meet our criteria. 
An earlier version of the NeuronDB ontology 
attempted to provide this type of foundational 
model17. In this model, individual neuron types are 
further subclassed by a restriction on the membrane 
property found in that neuron and the compartment in 
which that property was found. This is accomplished 
using a compound restriction on the has_part 
property which is imported from the OBO Relation 
Ontology; for example: "ro:has_part some (Soma and 
not (has_Current some I_Na_t))". These subclasses 
are given names, although this is not strictly required, 
such 
as 
CA1_oriens_alveus_interneuron_with_ 
GabaA_ receptor_in_Soma. Although this approach 
has the advantage of merging information about 
membrane properties with the neuron taxonomy, it 
does so at the expense of modeling clarity and ease 
of querying. A more intuitive approach might be to 
use separate properties to indicate presence of a 
compartment and presence of a membrane property, 
rather than expressing both of them with the has_part 
property. We could also punning to state directly the 
properties and compartments that are present instead 
of enforcing them through a restriction object.  
We expect that end users will interact with our 
ontology in two ways. They may wish to use the 
terms from the foundational portion of our ontology 
to further describe neurons and neuronal properties, 
either by subclassing or through statement objects 
such as those of our NeuronPropertyStatement class. 
Secondly, the data representative portion can be used 
to facilitate a browser for information about 
neurological research. 
Future Directions 
In line with this second purpose, we are using the 
Senselab Neuron Ontology as the basis for SWISL, 
the Semantic Web Interface to Senselab, a re­
designed 
version 
of 
the 
Entrez 
Neuron 
neuroinformatics browser18. This web application 
allows users to perform searches using the hierarchy 
of terms from our ontology and obtain results 
collected from research literature. Because the search 
terms are encoded with their meaning, the results are 
potentially more informative than those obtained 
using 
a 
standard 
search 
engine. 
SWISL is 
implemented using the Turbogears python web 
development framework19. Data is stored in RDF 
triples using the Virtuoso Open Source database20. To 
facilitate the full range of OWL DL reasoning while 
maintaining 
optimal 
performance, 
all 
logical 
entailments are generated beforehand by running the 
data through the Pellet reasoner prior to insertion into 
Virtuoso. Interaction with the data store is handled 
through the rdfalchemy library21, which provides an 
object-relational mapping layer between python

objects and SPARQL in much the fashion as tools 
like Hibernate, SQLAlchemy and LINQ do for SQL. 
Several extensions to rdfalchemy were created to 
allow it to handle more complex joins and filters. 
SWISL is available for use at: 
http://bioinformatics.med.yale.edu/swizzle. 
In the near future, we hope to strengthen our 
ontology through integration with the NIF project. As 
developers of Senselab, we are part of the multi-
institutional consortium which is collaborating to 
define the NIF standard ontology. As we benefit from 
the use of standardized neurological vocabulary 
defined by NIF, we hope that the observations about 
neuron property relationships that our ontology 
makes possible can be used to extend the NIF 
ontology. We also would like to incorporate 
information from other neurological databases into 
our neuron ontology. To start, this would involve 
incorporating some of the other Senselab databases to 
allow us to express relationships such as those 
between neurons and genes or neurons and research 
models. Additionally, the modeling strategies we 
employed in the creation of SLNO can be used in a 
similar fashion to allow the SWISL application to 
query neurological data from a wide variety of 
sources.

Development of Neural Electromagnetic Ontologies (NEMO): Ontology-Based 
Tools for Representation and Integration of Event-Related Brain Potentials

Abstract 
We 
describe 
a 
first-generation 
ontology 
for 
representation and integration of event-related brain 
potentials 
(ERPs). The 
ontology 
is designed 
following OBO “best practices” and is augmented 
with tools to perform ontology-based labeling and 
annotation of ERP data, and a database that enables 
semantically based reasoning over these data. 
Because certain high-level concepts in the ERP 
domain are ill-defined, we have developed methods 
to support coordinated updates to each of these three 
components. This approach consists of “top-down” 
(knowledge-driven) design and implementation, 
followed by “bottom-up” (data-driven) validation 
and refinement. Our goal is to build an ERP ontology 
that is logically valid, empirically sound, robust in 
application, and transparent to users. This ontology 
will be used to support sharing and meta-analysis of 
EEG and MEG data collected within our Neural 
Electromagnetic Ontologies (NEMO) project. 
Introduction 
In the last two decades, neuroscience has witnessed 
the development of some exciting new methods for 
research on human brain function—including high-
density electroencephalography (EEG), whole-head 
magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Each of these 
methods has contributed important insights on human 
brain function. At the same time, the proliferation of 
data has made clear the need for large-scale summary 
and integration of research results. To meet this need, 
several groups have been working to develop formal 
ontologies that can be used for consistent annotation, 
sharing, and meta-analysis of neuroscience data1,2. 
In the present paper, we describe initial steps in the 
development of an ERP (event-related potentials) 
ontology. ERPs are measures of brain electrical 
activity (EEG or “brainwaves”) that are time-locked 
to experimental events (e.g., the appearance of a 
word). These measures provide a powerful technique 
for studying brain function, because they are 
acquired noninvasively and can therefore be used in a 
variety of populations —e.g., children and patients, 
as well as healthy adults. In addition, they provide 
detailed information about the time dynamics, as well 
as the scalp spatial distribution, of neural activity 
during various cognitive and behavioral tasks.  
ERP research is likely to enjoy several benefits from 
the development of ERP ontologies. Historically, 
progress in this area has been hampered by debates 
over how to define high-level concepts3. As a result, 
it is has been hard to achieve even informal 
consensus, let alone quantitative syntheses of results 
across experiments (i.e., statistical "meta-analysis"). 
In this context, the process of building an ontology 
may prove to be a healthy exercise. Where there are 
debates over concepts, the need to make these 
concepts explicit will bring controversies into the 
open. Where there is mere inconsistency in labeling, 
the existence of a common reference may lead to 
standards for reporting that will better support cross-
lab integration of research results. 
To address these aims, we have assembled an 
international team of ERP researchers and computer 
scientists to found the Neural Elecromagnetic 
Ontologies (NEMO) consortium3,4. The major goal of 
our project is to address basic scientific questions in 
ERP research using ontology-based classification and 
labeling of ERP data, particularly in studies of 
language comprehension. The present paper gives an 
overview of the NEMO project and describes how it 
builds on and extends other efforts in bio- and neuro­
ontology development. 
NEMO Framework 
Our framework includes the following components: 
1.  Top-down (knowledge-driven) specification and 
coding of domain concepts (NEMO ontologies); 
2.  Bottom-up 
(data-driven) 
validation 
and 
refinement of complex concepts, including tools 
for ontology-based labeling of ERP data; 
3.  An international consortium of experts in ERP 
methods, with a shared interest in language; 
4.  An ontology database and inference engine to 
enable semantic queries over labeled data. 
Each of these components is described in the 
following sections.

Top-down Ontology Development 
Traditional methods for ontology development can be 
described as top-down or knowledge-driven, and are 
largely manual. The process typically begins with 
knowledge capture, that is, expert identification of a 
relatively small set of domain concepts. In NEMO, 
we have focused on defining concepts that represent 
spatial and temporal attributes of ERP patterns, as 
well as some functional (i.e., cognitive) concepts that 
are of immediate interest for analysis of ERP 
experiment data (building on previous efforts in the 
development of cognitive ontologies1,2). In addition, 
because our goal is to use ontologies to develop tools 
for labeling of ERP data, we have represented data-
level concepts in a separate but linked namespace. 
These first steps in ontology development are 
documented in NEMOlex, a text document that was 
modeled 
after 
Neurolex 
(formerly 
BirnLex2). 
NEMOlex contains natural language descriptions of 
concepts (classes and relations), organized by 
categories (e.g., spatial, temporal, and functional).  
In the next step, domain experts work with ontology 
engineers to develop a formal conceptualization of 
domain-specific 
concepts. These 
concepts 
are 
subsequently coded in the Web Ontology Language 
(OWL), and Protégé is used to generate a set of web-
accessible documents that can be viewed online (see 
nemo.nic.uoregon.edu for links to owl ontologies).  
Throughout this process we have worked to 
implement recommendations of the Open Biomedical 
Ontologies (OBO) community5. Domain-specific 
concepts in NEMO are linked to more basic or 
foundational concepts, as implemented in the Basic 
Formal Ontology (Figure 1). Similarly, to facilitate 
reuse and integration of NEMO with other 
neuroscience ontologies, we have aligned our efforts 
with members of the OBO, including fBIRN and 
NIFSTD. For example, the NEMO concept scalp is 
defined as a proper_part_of NeuroLex class head. In 
addition, we have designed NEMO ontologies to be 
modular wherever possible. Concepts representing 
spatial, temporal, and functional objects and

properties are therefore stored in different name 
spaces 
(NEMO_spatial, 
NEMO_temporal, 
and 
NEMO_functional). Of key importance are ERP 
spatiotemporal patterns that are seen in particular 
experiment contexts. These patterns have distinctive 
spatial, temporal and functional attributes as 
described in the following section. Pattern definitions 
are represented as first-order rules in our merged 
NEMO_erp ontology. 
Bottom-up Validation and Refinement 
While ontologies are intended to capture expert (i.e., 
domain) knowledge, knowledge in certain areas may 
be 
uncertain 
or 
changing. 
For 
example, 
spatiotemporal ERP patterns, which are the main 
concepts of interest in the ERP domain, are often ill-
defined. The same label (e.g., “N400”) can be used to 
pick out manifestly different entities3. Conversely, 
the same pattern may be called by different names in 
different experiment paradigms or research groups.  
The existence of a standard ERP ontology can help to 
address this lack of consistency, but there is no 
guarantee that concepts defined using “top-down” 
methods will be optimal for classification, labeling, 
and annotation of actual ERP data. To address this 
concern, NEMO has adopted a data-driven strategy 
for validating and refining high-level patterns before 
encoding this knowledge in our ontologies. This 
strategy is used to augment first-pass ontology 
engineering steps described in the previous section.  
Our approach is outlined in Figure 2. It begins with 
expert specification of spatial, temporal, and 
functional concepts, including definitions of patterns 
that are commonly found in ERP data. These 
ERP patterns that exist and (b) the spatial and 
temporal attributes that define these patterns (see Ref. 
[3], Appendix B for concrete examples). To test these 
hypotheses, we encode these pattern rules in an 
automatic data classification and labeling tool. ERP 
datasets are summarized by extracting attribute 
vectors that constitute a compact summary of the 
measured data. The values of these spatiotemporal 
metrics are then compared to rule-specific thresholds 
for each ERP pattern of interest. Results are recorded 
in a true/false table, and observations meeting pattern 
criteria are flagged as instances of that pattern. 
Next, we perform clustering on the spatial and 
temporal values of these summary metrics using the 
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm3,4. The 
resulting clusters represent candidate pattern classes, 
which are characterized by the central tendencies of 
their cluster attributes (e.g., mean latency and 
amplitude over scalp regions of interest). Based on 
these results, we refine our initial hypotheses about 
the number of pattern classes in the ontology and the 
definitions of these patterns. If similar results are 
obtained across multiple datasets, this leads in turn to 
a revision of NEMO ontologies and ontology-based 
tools for pattern classification and labeling.  
We have applied these methods to several datasets3,4, 
and results have led to refinements of our methods 
for ontology-based labeling. In our current ERP 
labeling tools, for example, we have omitted 
reference to high-level ERP pattern concepts, such as 
the “N400.” Concepts are still coded in the 
NEMO_erp ontology, but with provisional notes that 
indicate they are based on working hypotheses that

are awaiting robust empirical testing and validation. 
The NEMO Consortium 
The application domain for our project is language 
processing. We have established an international 
consortium of experts in this area who contribute 
ERP data from experiments and collaborate on the 
design and testing of ontology-based tools developed 
for NEMO. Consortium members include John 
Connolly (McMaster U.), Timothy Curran (U. 
Colorado), Dennis Molfese (U. Louisville), Charles 
Perfetti (U. Pittsburgh), Joseph Dien (U. Maryland), 
and Kerry Kilborn (Glasgow U.). 
The NEMO Ontology Database 
The NEMO database will store large numbers of ERP 
datasets collected from multiple research sites (e.g., 
from members of our research consortium). As 
described above, we have developed MATLAB 
scripts that automatically decompose, classify, label, 
and annotate ERP data using ontological terms. On 
the backend, we will support ontology-based 
querying and reasoning by using specialized 
databases designed to model the class (subsumption) 
hierarchy as well as most integrity and cardinality 
constraints. These databases will be coupled with a 
reasoning engine (OntoEngine6) to support efficient 
and scalable knowledge-based query answering. For 
example, consider the following database query: 
Return all data instances that belong to ERP pattern 
classes which have a surface positivity over frontal 
regions of interest and are earlier than the N400. 
In 
this 
query, 
“frontal 
region” 
is 
a 
clear 
generalization that can be unfolded into constituent 
parts (e.g., right frontal, left frontal; see Figure 1). At 
an even more abstract level, the “N400” is a pattern 
class that is associated with spatial, temporal, and 
functional properties (Figure 2). As described above, 
these three types of concepts are encoded in separate 
namespaces, and linking concepts are used to 
combine them for definition of high-level pattern 
concepts in NEMO. This design allows for a rich and 
flexible range of queries, which we refer to as 
ontology-based queries7. 
NEMO has investigated several methods of using 
databases to support ontology-based queries. A view-
based approach is commonly used to simplify 
instance-checking and subsumption-based reasoning 
by unfolding views at query time. By contrast, we 
have developed a new method that uses asynchronus, 
event-driven triggers to forward-propagate the 
knowledge model so that queries are answered more 
quickly and efficiently7. 
Summary and Conclusions 
In conclusion, we have described a first-generation 
ontology for representation and integration of event-
related brain potentials. The ontology is designed 
following OBO “best practices” and is augmented 
with tools to perform ontology-based labeling and 
querying of ERP data.  
We have further described how data mining (i.e., 
clustering) is used to help validate and refine top-
down ERP ontologies. These ontologies will be used 
to support sharing and meta-analysis of cognitive 
neuroscience data collected within the NEMO 
project.

Generating Homology Relationships by Alignment of Anatomical Ontologies

Abstract 
The anatomy of model species is described in 
ontologies, which are used to standardize the 
annotations of experimental data, such as gene 
expression patterns. To compare such data between 
species, we aim to establish homology relations 
between ontologies describing different species. We 
present a new algorithm, and its implementation in 
the software Homolonto, to create new relationships 
between anatomical ontologies, based on the 
homology concept. These relationships and the 
Homolonto 
software 
are 
available 
at 
http://bgee.unil.ch/ 
Introduction 
To be able to compare biological data, we need to use 
ontologies, to ensure that a biological concept is 
unambiguously associated to a unique identifier. To 
achieve this, ontologies such as the Gene Ontology1 
are increasingly used. Websites dedicated to model 
species also rely on the use of ontologies, for 
example the zebrafish anatomy for ZFIN2, or the 
Mouse gross anatomy and development3. 
We are interested in integrating and comparing gene 
expression patterns between several species4. This 
raises the question of encoding corresponding 
information between ontologies which describe 
different anatomies (e.g. zebrafish and human). The 
most widely accepted criterion to make such 
comparisons in biology is homology5. Homology is 
classically defined as the relation between structures 
which derive from a same ancestral structure, 
although other definitions are discussed. It should be 
noted that the exact definition is up to the user, 
whose input will define which pairs of terms are 
defined as homologous.  
To apply this concept in practice, hundreds of terms 
must be compared between ontologies. Although a 
purely manual annotation of homologies is possible, 
it would be too time consuming to be done for all 
terms between several divergent species. Kruger et 
al.6 used a manual approach to find similarities 
between simplified anatomy ontologies for human 
and mouse. There is also an on-going effort to 
integrate 
anatomical 
ontologies, 
the 
Common 
Anatomy Reference Ontology project CARO7. 
Since the problem of aligning anatomical ontologies 
is to find correspondences between the concepts of 
two ontologies, we draw on methods from "schema 
matching", or "ontology alignment"8,9. Ontology 
alignment 
is 
the 
process 
of 
determining 
correspondences between ontology concepts. Usually, 
this technique is used to find the common concepts 
present in two ontologies. In the case of anatomical 
ontologies, the concepts to align are not strictly 
common, but rather, related: a homology relationship 
is not an equivalence relationship. For this reason, 
ontology alignment approaches developed for other 
applications (e.g. medicine oriented descriptions of 
human9, 10) cannot be applied as such: these methods 
would be misled by the existence of elements of 
same names and related to the same concept, but not 
homologous (e.g. eye of insects and of vertebrates), 
or reciprocally, homologous elements with different 
names (e.g. pectoral fin and upper limb).  
We present here a new algorithm, and its 
implementation in the Java software Homolonto, to 
create 
new 
relationships 
between 
anatomical 
ontologies, based on the homology concept. Thus the 
basic aim of Homolonto is to propose in priority to 
the user the best candidate pairs of homologs, and 
avoid the need to consider many irrelevant pairs. 
Homolonto Algorithm 
1) Computing word specific scores: Score modifiers 
are computed for all words of the ontologies being 
aligned. Each word present at least once in both 
ontologies being aligned (O1 and O2) is given a 
score modifier based on its number of occurrences 
f(word, O): 
Mod(word, Oi) = 1/(1+log10(f(word, Oi))) eq. 1 
Mod(word) = Mod(word, O1) *Mod(word, O2) eq. 2 
2) Starting list of propositions: To initialize the 
algorithm we define first obvious similarities 
between the terms of the ontologies to align. Based 
on the assumption that two structures that have the 
same name are likely homologous, the initial 
propositions are formed of terms with identical 
names. In this process, we also consider the synonym 
field of the terms. Each pair of names n1, n2, is given 
a base score, dependent on the words shared: 
Base_score(n1, n2) = base_homonymy_score * 
max(Mod(word)) * |n1∩n2| / max(|n1|, |n2|) eq. 3 
35

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where |n| is the number of words in n, |n1∩n2| is the 
number of words shared by n1 and n2, and 
max(Mod(word)) is computed over all shared words. 
In the starting list, |n1∩n2| = |n1| = |n2| by definition, 
but this is not the case at further iterations of the 
algorithm. 
3) Initial propagation step: The score of these 
propositions is propagated between neighbors. This 
initial propagation is bidirectional, and limited to 
already defined propositions. For example, the score 
of the "optic cup" pair is added to the score of the 
"eye" pair, as "optic cup" is part of "eye", and both 
pairs are initial propositions. Symmetrically the score 
of the "eye" pair is added to the "optic cup" pair. But 
the score of "eye" is not propagated to e.g. the 
pairing of "visual system" (ZFA2 parent of "eye") 
with "sensory organ" (EHDAA11, 12 parent of "eye"), 
because this pair is not an initial proposition. The aim 
of this step is to increase the score of the most likely 
homologs. 
4) Cleaning the initial proposition list: The design of 
some ontologies may generate many false positives, 
typically through repetition of the same name as a 
child of diverse structures (e.g. 76 occurrences of 
"mesenchyme" in EHDAA). To avoid this, if a term 
is a member of several propositions with different 
scores, we initially keep only the best scoring 
proposition. If there are more than 5 highest scoring 
propositions for a given term, we remove all 
propositions for this term. 
5) Evaluation step: Each proposition is presented to 
the user, in descending order of scores. The user has 
to validate, invalidate, or delay decision regarding the 
proposed homology. 
6) Computation step: If one of the terms of a 
validated pair is already a member of an homology 
group, then the other term is added to the homology 
group. Otherwise, a new homology group is created, 
containing both terms of the validated pair. The 
information of homology is propagated through the 
hierarchy by the use of a validated homology score 
(eq. 4). The underlying idea is that if two terms A and 
B are homologous, then one of the children of A is 
probably homologous to one of the children of B. 
During the propagation the validated homology score 
is added to the base score (eq. 3) of pairs of terms: 
Propagated_score(a, b) = validated_homology_score 
* (max_depth + 1 - present_depth) / (max_depth + 1) 
eq. 4 
Total_score(a, b) = Propagated_score(a, b) + 
Base_score(na, nb) 
eq. 5a 
Where na is the name of term a. In the present 
implementation, the max_depth is 1, and the 
validated homology score is 1.5 times the base 
homonymy score. For pairs of terms which are not 
yet a proposition, a new proposition is created, and 
the base score is computed. This will include cases of 
partial homonymy, for which eq. 3 down weights 
names which share a lower proportion of words. 
Pairs which have been previously invalidated by the 
user will not receive a propagated score, and will 
remain invalidated. 
To down weight potential false positives due to 
validation of terms with many children, the 
propagated score is reduced proportionally to the 
number of new propositions for each term of the 
ontology to align (eq. 5b). 
Total_score(a, bi) = Propagated_score(a, bi)/ ((|b| + 1) 
* 2) + Base_score(na, nbi) eq. 5b 
Where a is a term of the ontology to align, bi is a 
term of the reference ontology, and |b| is the number 
of new propositions for term a. When a proposition 
(a, bi) is invalidated, |b| is updated, and the Total 
score(a, bi) increases for the remaining propositions. 
When the terms of an invalidated proposition share 
common words, then the score modifiers of all shared 
words is diminished (eq. 6). As this is repeated, 
words which tend to generate false positives will be 
increasingly down weighted. 
Mod'(word) = Mod(word) * 0.9 
eq. 6 
7) Iteration: Evaluation of propositions (step 5), 
ordered by total score (base score + propagated 
score), and computation (step 6), is repeated until the 
user decides to terminate, or no more propositions are 
generated. 
Homolonto Results 
Homolonto has been used to align six anatomical 
ontologies to date, representing four vertebrate 
species (human and mouse have different ontologies 
for adult and embryonic stages). We will present 
more in detail two alignments: zebrafish (ZFA 
ontology2) / Xenopus (XAO ontology13), which 
illustrates a best case scenario of two recently 
updated ontologies, conforming to the CARO 
standards7, with annotations of synonyms and 
definitions, and low redundancy. And human 
(EHDAA ontology11, 12) / mouse (EMAPA ontology11, 
3) which, despite the similarity in anatomy, illustrates 
a more difficult scenario of large ontologies, with 
issues such as repetition of names (76 occurrences of 
"mesenchyme" in human, 93 in mouse), due to 
splitting of concepts among morphological structures 
or among developmental stages.

The main observation is that our algorithm is 
successful at ordering propositions. In the "easy" case 
of zebrafish / Xenopus, there are only seven 
invalidated propositions in the first 150 (95% 
validation). This is followed by a relatively short 
interval of iterations where validated and invalidated 
propositions are mixed: 46% of validations between 
iterations 151 and 200, and 20% between 201 and 
250. Further iterations generate mostly invalidated 
propositions (3% validation from 251 to 735). Thus 
93% of all validations occurred in the first 250 
iterations.  
The pattern is similar for the human / mouse 
alignment. In the first 1400 iterations, 99% of 
propositions are validated. In the next 600 iterations, 
the figure reduces to 63%, and in the last 962 
iterations it falls to 21%. This slower decrease 
illustrates the complexity of this alignment. The 
validation rate of 66% shows that the propositions 
were mostly worth considering, and that the high 
number of propositions was due indeed to the size of 
the ontologies, not to a default in the algorithm. 
Results also show that manual expertise is necessary, 
since even in the high scoring propositions some are 
invalid. Overall, 27% of invalidations are pairs of 
terms with identical names. Interestingly, Homolonto 
manages to give these misleading homonyms low 
priority: homonyms within the first 1000 iterations 
have a 99% chance of being homologs, whereas 
homonyms within the last 1000 iterations only have a 
19% chance of being homologs. Thus 93% of 
invalidated homonyms appear after iteration 1400. 
Generating Relationships between Groups of 
Homologs 
Homolonto is used to generate pairwise homology 
relationships between anatomical ontologies. As 
homology relationships are transitive, these pairwise 
alignments can be merged into homologous organs 
groups (HOGs). Homolonto thus generates HOGs, 
and mapping of species-specific anatomical structures 
to these HOGs. HOGs then need to be structured as 
an ontology to allow reasoning on them. This means 
that, at a minimum, relationships amongst them have 
to be designed. Another algorithm has thus been 
developed to infer relationships between HOGs.  
1) Initial Step: all possible paths between HOGs are 
retrieved. For instance, if an anatomical structure "a", 
mapped to the HOG "A", has a part_of relationship 
to the anatomical structure "b", mapped to the HOG 
"B", then a putative part_of relationship is defined 
between HOGs "A" and "B". 
Relationships between HOGs are often indirect (e.g. 
structure "a", mapped to HOG "A", part_of structure 
"c", part_of structure "b", mapped to HOG "B"). If 
the first relation (the relation "outgoing" from the 
child HOG, "A" in the previous example) and the last 
relation (the relation “incoming” to the parent HOG, 
"B" in the previous example) are of the same type 
(e.g. part_of, is_a), then the putative relationship is 
defined as this type. Otherwise, the relationship is 
defined as the SKOS14 type broader_than. 
2) Skipping relations from not-trusted ontologies: 
some ontologies do not follow the OBO principles, 
and implement for instance only one type of relation 
amongst all concepts (e.g. EV15 only uses is_a 
relationships). The user may choose to not use these 
ontologies to define relation types. All the putative 
relations inferred by these ontologies at step 1 are 
then set as broader_than. But the final relation type 
between these HOGs can still be inferred thanks to 
other ontologies. 
3) Skipping relations defined by too few species: if 
the proportion of species defining a relation, 
compared to the total number of species involved in 
the creation of the HOGs, is below a threshold 
defined by the user ("species coverage"), then the 
relation is defined to the type broader_than, and the 
algorithm stops examining relations between these 
HOGs. Indeed, in such case, inferred relation types 
may not be trusted. 
4) Defining within-ontology agreement: several 
anatomical structures from the same ontology can 
belong to the same HOG. This can generate a within-
ontology conflict for defining a relation type. For 
instance, structures "a" and "b" allow to define a 
putative part_of relationship between HOGs "A" and 
"B", while structures "a’" and "b’", belonging to the 
same ontology, define a putative is_a relationship 
between these HOGs. The algorithm then calculates, 
for each relation type, the proportion that the number 
of paths defining this relation type represents, 
compared to the total number of paths between these 
two HOGs for this ontology. If, for a type, this 
proportion exceeds a threshold ("within-ontology 
agreement"), defined by the user and at least greater 
than 0.5, then this relation type is attributed for this 
species between these HOGs. Otherwise, the relation 
is defined to the type broader_than for this ontology. 
5) Defining inter-ontology agreement: different 
ontologies can define different relation types between 
two related HOGs. This conflict is resolved in the 
same way as at step 4, by using a threshold ("inter­
ontology agreement"), defined by the user and at 
least greater than 0.5. 
6) Removing cyclic relationships: by inferring 
automatically the relationships between HOGs, cycles 
37

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may be generated (e.g. HOG "A" part_of HOG "B" 
part_of HOG "A"), whereas the ontology has to be 
acyclic. If such cycles are detected, the algorithm 
stops with an error message prompting the user to 
make a decision: the user has then to manually 
remove one of the involved relationships. 
7) Removing redundancies: if several relationships 
are redundant, only the deepest relationship is 
conserved; for instance, if a HOG "A" has two 
substructures by a part_of relationship, "B" and "C", 
and if "C" is also a substructure of "B", then the 
direct relationship between the HOGs "A" and "C" is 
removed.  
8) Curation step: a curator has then to manually 
review all the broader_than relations, to attribute 
them to a type defined by the OBO Relation 
Ontology16. Some custom relationships, not inferred 
by the algorithm, can also be added at this step. 
Conclusion 
To date, the use of Homolonto, followed by a 
curation process, allowed to define 1004 HOGs, 
involving 4088 structures from 6 anatomical 
ontologies (ZFA2, EHDAA11, 12, EV15, EMAPA11, 12 , 
MA17, and XAO13). 
The algorithm to design relationships amongst the 
HOGs inferred 1188 relations. With the more 
stringent parameters (species coverage = 1, within-
ontology agreement = 1, inter-ontology agreement = 
1), 341 of them are defined as part_of, all the others 
as broader_than. The curation step to review these 
broader_than relations is currently under process. 
The 
HOG 
ontology 
has 
been 
successfully 
implemented into Bgee4, a database for studying gene 
expression evolution, and already allows to perform 
automated, cross-species, gene expression pattern 
comparisons. 
The Homolonto software and source code, and the 
HOG ontology, are available from the download 
section of the Bgee website (http://bgee.unil.ch). The 
algorithm to generate relationships between groups 
of homologs will be available soon.

Abstract 
There is a plethora of disease ontologies available, 
all potentially useful for the annotation of biological 
datasets. We define seven desirable features for such 
ontologies and examine whether or not these features 
are supported by eleven disease ontologies. The four 
ontologies most closely aligned with our desiderata 
are Disease Ontology, SNOMED CT, NCI thesaurus 
and UMLS. 
Introduction 
Ontologies have been developed for the annotation of 
biological datasets from multiple perspectives 
including functional annotation of gene products 
(Gene Ontology), molecular sequences (Sequence 
ontology) and phenotypes (Mammalian Phenotype 
Ontology, Phenotypic Quality Ontology). Entries in 
biological datasets also need to be linked to diseases, 
either human diseases or experimental models of 
diseases in model organisms. Ontologies of diseases 
include the Disease Ontology (DO), from the Open 
Biomedical Ontology (OBO) family. The NCI 
Thesaurus was developed for the annotation of cancer 
research and includes many diseases, but its focus on 
cancer can be a limitation for use in other domains. 
On the other hand, terminologies have been long been 
developed for the purpose of annotating clinical 
records, including the International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD) and SNOMED CT. However, these 
terminologies have not been widely adopted by 
biomedical researchers for annotating disease entities in 
biological datasets. Moreover, neither terminology is 
free of intellectual property restrictions and a license 
or fee may be required for their use, which represents 
a limiting factor. 
Finally, terminology integration resources such the 
Unified 
Medical 
Language 
System 
(UMLS) 
Metathesaurus and NCBO’s BioPortal both integrate 
more than one hundred biomedical terminologies, 
including all those mentioned above. Moreover, both 
resources provide mappings across terminologies, 
facilitating the integration of biological and clinical 
data required for translational medicine. However, 
their use may necessitate significant training. 
The objective of this study is to propose a list of 
desirable features for an ontology of diseases suitable 
for the annotation of biological datasets, and to 
analyze a list of candidate terminologies through the 
framework provided by these features. 
Desiderata for selecting ontologies have been 
established by the OBO Foundry1. While interesting 
and potentially relevant to the domain of diseases, we 
find some of these criteria unnecessarily restrictive 
for the purpose of annotating biological datasets, 
while key criteria (from our specific perspective) are 
missing. A brief analysis of the OBO Foundry criteria 
in the context of our study is proposed in the 
discussion. 
This work also differs from Cimino’s desiderata for 
controlled medical vocabularies2 in that we focus on 
content and usability for a particular purpose in 
addition to representation issues and development 
process. 
Methods 
We first select a list of biomedical terminologies and 
ontologies 
(hereafter 
referred 
to 
simply 
as 
ontologies) potentially suitable for the annotation of 
diseases in biological datasets. We establish a list of 
characteristics from these ontologies, focusing on 
those characteristics which represent potential 
barriers to adoption of these terminologies by 
biomedical researchers. We apply the list of features 
to each candidate ontology and summarize our 
findings in a feature x ontology matrix. 
Candidate Ontologies 
In order to identify candidate ontologies for diseases, 
we explored the two major repositories of biomedical 
ontologies: The Unified Medical Language System 
(UMLS) and NCBO’s BioPortal. We investigated 
ontologies whose focus is on human diseases and 
phenotypes, as well as ontologies which contain a 
significant number of disease entities. In practice, we 
exploited the metadata provided with OBO ontologies 
and selected those ontologies for which the domain is 
contains “phenotype” or “health”. No similar 
mechanism is available for the UMLS and we simply 
used our knowledge of the source vocabularies to 
make our selection. References to the ontologies

discussed below are listed in Table 1 (appendix). This 
selection process led to the identification of eleven 
ontologies potentially suitable for the annotation of 
diseases in biological datasets. 
•  Disease Ontology (DO): Controlled terminology 
from the OBO family created for annotation 
purposes as part of the NuGene project at 
Northwestern University. Coverage restricted to 
diseases. 
•  Online 
Mandelian 
Inheritance 
in 
Man 
(OMIM): Knowledge base on human genetic 
diseases developed at John Hopkins University 
and available through the NCBI Entrez system. Its 
terminological component – including clinical 
synopses – is available through the UMLS. 
Coverage restricted to genetic diseases. 
•  International Classification of Diseases (ICD): 
Classification from the World Health Organization 
(WHO) family of health classifications, with many 
local adaptations. ICD9-CM, developed by the 
Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) 
for use in the US, includes clinical modifications. 
Coverage restricted to diseases and health 
problems. 
•  SNOMED CT: The largest clinical terminology 
developed 
by 
the 
International 
Health 
Terminology Standard Development Organization 
(IHTSDO) for use in electronic health records and 
adopted by eleven countries to date. Broad 
coverage including diseases. 
•  Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): Controlled 
vocabulary developed by the U.S. National 
Library of Medicine for the indexing and retrieval 
of the biomedical literature, especially in the 
MEDLINE 
bibliographic 
database. 
Broad 
coverage including diseases. 
•  NCI Thesaurus (NCIt): Controlled vocabulary 
developed by the National Cancer Institute to 
support the integration of information related to 
cancer research. Broad coverage including 
diseases. 
•  Unified Medical Language System (UMLS): 
Terminology integration system developed by the 
U.S. National Library of Medicine, establishing a 
correspondence among terms from different 
terminologies for a given biomedical entity. Broad 
coverage including diseases. 
•  Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO): Controlled 
vocabulary 
for 
the 
phenotypic 
features 
encountered in human hereditary and other 
diseases. Developed by a consortium including 
Charite Hospital (Berlin) and the University of 
Cambridge 
(UK). 
Coverage 
restricted 
to 
monogenic diseases listed in OMIM. 
•  Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO): Ontology 
of phenotypic qualities, intended for use in a 
number of applications, primarily defining 
composite phenotypes and phenotype annotation. 
Coverage restricted to phenotypes. 
•  Mammalian Phenotype Ontology: Controlled 
vocabulary 
for 
the 
“robust 
annotation 
of 
mammalian phenotypes” currently used for the 
annotation of phenotypic data in mouse and rat 
databases. Developed at the Jackson Laboratory. 
Coverage restricted to phenotypes. 
•  Logical Observation Identifiers Names and 
Codes (LOINC): Set of names and codes for 
laboratory 
and 
other 
clinical 
observations 
(elements of clinical phenotypes). Developed at 
the Regenstrief Institute. Coverage restricted to 
clinical observations. 
Phenotype ontologies for organisms other than Homo 
sapiens were ignored. (e.g., Yeast phenotypes). 
Ontologies of diseases included as part of a broader 
ontology were ignored when they were unlikely to 
provide additional coverage or characteristics useful 
for the discussion in this paper (e.g., National Drug 
File Reference Terminology and International 
Classification of Primary Care). Specialized resources 
(e.g., Online Congenital Multiple Anomaly/Mental 
Retardation 
Syndromes, 
Infectious 
Disease 
Ontology and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders), while providing deep coverage 
of a narrow subdomain of medicine, are unlikely to 
provide the broad coverage expected from an 
ontology of diseases and were ignored. 
Desirable Features 
Starting from the ten OBO Foundry principles, we 
have identified seven desirable features for an 
ontology of diseases. In each case, the absence of a 
feature represents a potential barrier to the adoption 
of a biomedical ontology for the annotation of 
diseases in biological datasets. Differences with the 
set of OBO Foundry principles are discussed later in 
this paper. 
•  No Intellectual Property Restrictions. The use 
of some vocabularies is limited to certain contexts 
(e.g., restriction for research purposes vs. 
production systems for some vocabularies in the 
UMLS) or to certain countries (e.g., member 
countries of the IHTSDO for SNOMED CT), or 
40

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subject to the payment of a fee (e.g., ICD 10). 
This feature is aligned with Foundry principle #1. 
•  Standard, Friendly Format. Availability of 
terminologies in formats that are standard (e.g., 
RDF, OWL) or friendly to biologists (e.g., OBO) 
is likely to foster adoption. In contrast, proprietary 
formats (e.g., RRF for the UMLS Metathesaurus) 
may represent a barrier to adoption. This feature 
corresponds roughly to Foundry principle #2. 
•  Existence 
of 
a 
Mapping 
to 
Clinical 
Terminologies. In the era of translational medicine, 
biological datasets must be linkable to clinical 
datasets. The existence of mappings between an 
ontology of diseases used for the annotation of 
biological datasets and clinical terminologies used 
in patient records is strong requirement. 
•  Harmonization 
with 
Other 
Biological 
Ontologies. Similarly to the requirement for 
integration with clinical terminologies, there is a 
need for a disease ontology to be integrated – if 
possible 
natively 
– 
with 
other 
biological 
ontologies. This feature corresponds roughly to 
Foundry principle #5. 
•  Regular Maintenance. The domain of diseases is 
in constant evolution and an ontology of disease 
shall reflect emerging diseases and changes in our 
understanding of the domain of diseases. This 
feature corresponds roughly to Foundry principle 
#4. 
•  Exhaustive Coverage of Diseases. At a given 
level of granularity, the ontology shall provide an 
exhaustive coverage of the domain. Terminologies 
focusing on a specific subdomain may have 
limited applicability outside this subdomain (e.g., 
focus on cancer in NCIt). 
•  Support for Automatic Reasoning. Annotations 
made to ontologies often form the basis for 
gaining new knowledge about biomedical entities. 
In order to process annotations efficiently and 
automatically, ontologies need to have a robust, 
formal 
structure 
and 
provide 
support 
for 
automated reasoning (e.g., through subsumption). 
A Framework for Comparing Disease Ontologies 
The desirable features listed above do not all have the 
same importance from the perspective of an ontology 
of diseases for annotation purposes. For example, 
coverage of diseases it of the outmost importance for 
an ontology of diseases and was given the highest 
weight (5). Interoperability with other ontologies 
(clinical and biological) and support for automatic 
reasoning correspond to major uses of ontologies and 
are also weighted more (2) than the remaining 
features (1). 
We examined the eleven candidate ontologies 
through the prism of the seven desirable features. 
More precisely, for each feature, we rated the 
ontology semi-quantitatively: 0 (no or minimal 
support for the feature), 0.5 (partial support of the 
feature) or 1 (reasonable support for the feature), 
assessed by the authors. The weights were applied to 
the ratings. Finally, the score of each ontology was 
computed by comparing the sum of the scores for 
each feature to the sum of all weights (14). 
Results 
The result of assessing the presence of the desirable 
features in the candidate ontologies is summarized in 
Figure 1 (appendix). Support for the desirable 
features ranges from 32% (OMIM, LOINC) to 68% 
(NCIt, UMLS). Seven ontologies have a score of 
50% or more. 
Discussion 
Applying the Desiderata. The top four contenders 
identified in our matrix of desirable features x 
ontologies (Figure 1) are Disease Ontology, SNOMED 
CT, NCIt and UMLS. Interestingly, these four 
ontologies made it to the top for slightly different 
reasons. Depending on what features are most 
important in a given use case, the ontologies 
corresponding to this profile of features should be 
selected. 
Phenotypes 
vs. 
Diseases. 
Precisely 
defining 
phenotype and disease is beyond the scope of this 
paper. However, we observed that phenotype 
ontologies containing pre-coordinated concepts (e.g., 
Mammalian Phenotype Ontology, LOINC) or 
supporting post-coordination (e.g., the Phenotypic 
Quality Ontology – PATO), cover low-level 
phenotypes and clinical observations (e.g., individual 
anatomical and physiological abnormalities) rather 
than diseases. Examples of phenotypes form MPO 
include enlarged liver, found in ontologies including 
MeSH, NCTt and SNOMED CT. In contrast, they 
mostly contain terms indicating deviation from 
normal anatomical structures or physiologic states 
(e.g., decreased liver weight), typically absent from 
the clinically-oriented disease ontologies. Phenotype 
ontologies seem suitable for the annotation of data 
with 
low-level 
phenotypes, 
whereas 
disease 
ontologies have application in the annotation of 
higher-order 
information 
about 
diseases, 
i.e., 
resulting from some elaborate diagnostic process.

principles of the OBO Foundry1, we found the 
Foundry principles to be generally too rigid for the 
purpose of annotating biological datasets and lacking 
consideration for legacy ontologies. Applying these 
principles strictly to the selection of ontologies would 
potentially result in unnecessarily excluding from 
consideration the datasets annotated to these legacy 
ontologies. 
Many legacy disease ontologies are not available in 
OWL or OBO format, but are widely used. 
Borrowing from “orthogonal” ontologies is a good 
principle for the coordinated development of 
ontologies (i.e., applied in a prospective manner). 
However, this principle can hardly be held against 
legacy disease ontologies. The absence of textual 
definition is a common feature to many legacy disease 
ontologies. It can be offset in part by the presence of 
formal definitions (in description logic-based systems) 
and usage information. Finally, most widely used 
disease ontologies are developed outside the OBO 
Foundry and not always in a collaborative manner. 
Limitations. The framework provided here for 
analyzing disease ontologies is relatively coarse and 
somewhat arbitrary. The list of desirable features and 
the weights would need to be adapted to specific 
annotation scenarios. For example, the presence of 
synonyms is required if annotations are to be 
discovered automatically in text corpora using text 
mining techniques. 
Conclusions 
The plethora of disease ontologies available to 
biomedical researchers for annotation purposes is not 
necessarily good news. In this domain in particular, 
reusing existing ontologies should be carefully 
considered before starting the development of a new 
one. Annotations made to different ontologies, 
including legacy ontologies, will likely need to be 
reconciled in order to enable interoperability among 
datasets, which is a strong requirement for 
translational 
medicine. 
Terminology 
integration 
systems such as the UMLS are thus expected to play 
a key role in data integration tasks.

Abstract 
We are developing a set of ontologies dealing with 
vector-borne diseases and the arthropod vectors that 
transmit them. For practical reasons (application 
priorities), we initiated this project with an ontology 
of insecticide resistance followed by a series of 
ontologies that describe malaria as well as 
physiological processes of mosquitoes that are 
relevant to, and involved in, disease transmission. 
These will be expanded to encompass other vector-
borne diseases as well as non-mosquito vectors. The 
aim of the whole undertaking, which is worked out in 
the frame of the international IDO (Infectious 
Disease Ontology) project, is to provide the 
community with a set of ontological tools that can be 
used both in the development of specific databases 
and, most importantly, in the construction of decision 
support systems (DSS) to control these diseases. 
The Problem of Vector-Borne Diseases  
Epidemiologists have brought together in one 
“functional“ group a series of diseases of different 
etiology and pathogenesis that share one key 
component: their mode of transmission (see Goddard, 
19991 and several chapters of Marquardt, 20052 for 
specific questions addressing insect-borne diseases 
and their vectors). These diseases are transmitted by 
the bite of a specific arthropod vector, which is 
usually an insect. The pathogenic agent is passed 
with the saliva transferred during the bite to the 
potential patient. Two additional characteristics are 
shared by most vector-borne diseases, namely most 
people affected live in the tropical regions of the 
world and, connected to this, the diseases affect 
mostly populations that are also heavily affected by 
poverty. The pathogens responsible for these diseases 
are very diverse, ranging from protozoan parasites 
(e.g. Plasmodium spp. in malaria, Leishmania spp. in 
leishmaniosis) and bacteria (e.g. Borrelia spp. in 
Lyme disease), to worms (e.g. Nematodes in filariasis 
and river blindness) and to viruses (e.g. Dengue, 
Yellow fever). Similarly, the vectors are also very 
diverse and range from mosquitoes (e.g. malaria and 
Dengue) 
and 
flies 
(e.g. 
Tsetse 
in 
African 
trypanosomiasis) to kissing bugs (Chagas’ disease) 
and ticks (e.g. Lyme disease). The extreme variation 
in the biology of both pathogens and the vectors 
makes it difficult to address vector-borne diseases as 
a whole. Importantly, these difficulties also affect 
significant aspects such as prevention, epidemiology, 
therapy, etc. 
A common theme, which in a sense unites these 
diseases, is the fact that their transmission can be 
blocked if the agents that transmit them, i.e. the 
arthropod vectors, are removed from the pertinent 
chain of events3. Vector control has therefore 
historically become a conditio sine qua non for the 
control of these infections4,5, and this fact has been 
exemplified by the elimination of malaria from most 
non-tropical areas of the globe6. While leading to 
about half a billion cases in the tropics every year, 
and still being responsible for anything between one 
and three million deaths (mostly children in sub-
Saharan Africa), this killer illness has practically 
disappeared from Europe and North America through 
intense insecticidal measures aimed at eliminating the 
Anopheline vectors. It should be stressed that, with 
the exception of the Yellow fever7, no vaccine is 
currently available for any vector-borne disease as an 
alternative prevention strategy that would act on a 
different level than that of the actual vector. 
Prevention focused on the vector includes not only 
control of insect populations through environmental 
management or the use of chemicals, but also the 
protection of individuals through the use of clothing, 
repellents, nets and screens8. 
Although greatly successful in the previous 
century, 
insect-control 
programmes 
are 
now 
immensely obstructed by a variety of reasons. These 
range from community opposition to a vast usage of 
chemicals9, to the development of resistance against 
these very chemicals by the insect vectors to be 
controlled10. 
Moreover, 
these 
problems 
are 
aggravated by several facts: resistance against drugs 
is also encountered in the pathogens11; vaccine 
development, if at all possible, is slow12; new drug 
development is not only slow but extremely 
expensive and the areas affected by the diseases in 
question are certainly not the ones that can easily 
spearhead such efforts due to the lack of economic 
and scientific resources in them13. It is therefore of 
utmost importance to develop innovative strategies 
for the control of vector-borne diseases. One novel 
approach is to use IT technologies as a complement 
43

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to the application of developments in the biology of 
disease vectors. While the latter projects make use of 
scientific research products such as whole genome 
sequences14,15, transgenesis16, and the use of other 
“intelligent” approaches17 the former potentially 
brings new specific tools that can be used for a more 
efficient, and often close-to-the-field management of 
pertinent disease data, including entomological ones.  
In this context, our group has embarked on a 
long project that involves the development of 
ontologies dealing with disease vectors and vector-
borne diseases18,19. The obvious rationale behind this 
is the need of these ontologies to unify the 
“language” 
spoken 
by 
vector 
biologists 
and 
epidemiologists. The ultimate end is to build a 
comprehensive ontology for insect-borne diseases 
that may consist of sub-ontologies, each addressing a 
specific aspect of the whole. In the frame of the 
Infectious 
Disease 
Ontology 
project 
(http://www.infectiousdisease 
ontology.org/Home.html), we initiated this effort 
focusing on malaria, but we are already expanding 
this to encompass most other vector-borne diseases 
as well. These ontologies, some of which are already 
available and some under development, will be 
presented below in a summary form. 
Ontologies and Vector-Borne Diseases: A Brief 
Description 
The aspects of vector-borne diseases that are in need 
of an ontological description range from those that 
deal with the diseases as such (e.g. pathogenesis, 
clinical aspects, therapy, etc.), to vector biology 
(physiological processes of the vectors) and to 
epidemiology and control in the widest sense of the 
terms (prevention, insect control, etc.). As stated 
earlier, these aspects are extremely diverse and 
complex, simply given the multitude of organisms 
involved (vectors and pathogens in addition to the 
human host) and the fact that we are often dealing 
with populations (additional level of granularity!). 
The construction of a comprehensive ontology, thus, 
if at all feasible, must be addressed using a piecemeal 
approach. It is clear that certain fundamental 
decisions have to be taken at the initial phases, and 
an open-ended advance is, in our mind, a must. We 
therefore decided, early on, that the end product 
would have to follow i) the rules set by the OBO 
Foundry20 and ii) be based on the basic formal 
ontology21,22. If long-term interoperability of future 
databases is to be achieved, these two choices are a 
prerequisite. This rule, of course, is the end goal and 
we decided to keep a certain degree of flexibility 
throughout the project until a “unified” ontology is 
constructed. One example for such a flexible 
approach is the fact that the ontology of insecticide 
resistance in mosquitoes that we developed (MIRO) 
does not follow the BFO in its initial versions but, 
rather, it is structured such that it can be adopted 
without many problems by the community that 
immediately needs to apply it in the field23. The 
MIRO forms the core of the related database on 
insecticide 
resistance 
(IRbase) 
that 
we 
also 
developed, and which was adopted for immediate use 
by the World Health Organization (Dialynas et al., 
2009, in preparation). We should state that we are 
nevertheless in the process of long term restructuring 
the ontology along BFO standards, such that its 
contents can be later included in the comprehensive 
ontology on vector-borne diseases.  
Although already submitted to and listed by the 
OBO Foundry, MIRO is a pure application ontology 
that is being used to drive a dedicated database, 
IRbase (http://anobase.vectorbase.org/ir/). It consists 
of four specially devised sub-ontologies that cover all 
aspects of insecticide resistance, with an emphasis on 
field 
work 
and 
monitoring. 
Thus, 
although 
mechanisms of resistance are covered, this is not 
done 
in 
detail. 
Furthermore, 
MIRO’s 
fifth 
component, a geographical one, uses in toto the 
controlled vocabulary Gazeteer to provide IRbase 
curators with records describing the areas in which 
data were collected. The MIRO is constantly being 
updated 
upon 
request 
by 
members 
of 
the 
international community that is involved in the study 
of insecticide resistance. 
The second ontology, which is still nameless, 
covers physiological processes of mosquitoes that are 
involved in disease transmission. The processes 
covered do not only address the actual transmission, 
i.e. the interplay between vectors and pathogens but, 
importantly, also the actual progression of events in 
the vector. We want to stress that the processes 
mentioned here are, in their vast majority, processes 
on the level of the organism and not cellular or sub-
cellular ones, such as the ones covered by the GO24, 
25. Thus, (near) top level classes are, among others, 
behaviour, sensory perception, processes of the 
immune system and nutrition. As an example, when 
looking at the children of “behaviour”, one will find 
a line of terms leading through the adult feeding 
behaviour to entities such as the four phases of 
“interrupted feeding” (exploratory phase, imbibing 
phase, probing phase and withdrawal phase). The 
ontology also covers processes that are not directly 
“linked” to disease transmission and this, obviously, 
for 
reasons 
of 
completion. 
For 
reasons 
of 
orthogonality, in all cases in which terms are already 
covered by established ontologies we adhere to these, 
along with their descendants. This is notably the case 
44

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for the Processes sub-ontology of the GO. Our 
ontology is far from complete, although it already 
covers more than 600 terms, which are all fully 
defined. 
The next ontology that we are in the process of 
populating with terms is the one describing malaria. 
This is the actual ontology that we decided to 
develop in the frame of IDO, and which we plan to 
expand in the near future in order to cover other 
vector-borne diseases as well. It is built based on 
BFO and the IDO reference ontology and it is meant 
to cover malaria on all possible levels. These 
obviously include both the clinical aspects of the 
disease 
in 
the 
widest 
sense 
(i.e. 
including 
epidemiology, etc.) and the biology of the disease 
that describes processes and objects of not immediate 
clinical relevance. We consider as such items (e.g. 
proteins) involved in the penetration of both 
mosquito and human/vertebrate cells as well as their 
interacting partners in the Plasmodium parasites. 
Again, similarly to the case of the ontology of 
physiological processes, we have taken care to 
include, wherever possible, direct imports of pre­
existing ontologies. One such example is the 
Plasmodium parasite life cycle stage and its 
descendants that all have cross-references to the, at 
the moment, inactive Plasmodium life cycle 
ontology. The malaria ontology has at this time about 
600 terms. 
Concluding Remarks 
The ontologies that we are constructing can be 
described as pure application ontologies that are 
meant to form the basis for specific tools such as 
specific databases or decision support systems for 
various diseases. The need for such tools became 
apparent immediately after the first working version 
of the MIRO and its “cousin” IRbase were made 
public. Not only did the international community 
immediately decide to adopt both tools, but also 
already within a few months after the initiation of 
data population, there are about 1350 sampled 
populations that are shown in the database. This is 
about 1250 more than what the insecticide resistance 
section in VectorBase carried, the only repository for 
data of this kind. In addition to databases that are 
driven by ontologies in an increasing fashion (see for 
example databases using the ontology-depending 
schema 
Chado26, 
such 
as 
FlyBase27,28 
and 
VectorBase29,30, ontologies are ideal tools for the 
design of intelligent DSS. In cases such as vector-
borne diseases, whose control is also hampered by 
weak infrastructure in endemic countries, these DSS 
can be used by medical workers and health agencies 
in remote areas, either for ongoing studies or in cases 
that need immediate attention31,32. 
One of the intricacies that we are already faced 
with is the planned expansion of the malaria-oriented 
ontologies, to cover many other vector-borne 
diseases. To understand the magnitude of the problem 
one should think of the fact that vector-borne 
diseases represent major threats to public health in 
wide and ecologically diverse areas of the world, that 
they are caused by completely different pathogens 
and that they are transmitted by completely different 
vectors. Thus, the challenge now is how to cover this 
broad spectrum of facts in a single ontology. There is 
naturally the possibility of cutting through the 
Gordian knot, by devising separate ontologies for 
each disease. The counter-argument in this case 
would be that, brought to an extreme, each malaria 
form (i.e. tertian, malignant and benign, and quartan, 
should have its own ontology) similar to the different 
forms of filariasis that are caused by different species 
of nematodes and whose clinical aspect differ only 
slightly. In addition, similarities between these 
diseases and the agents that transmit them may be 
obscured if different ontologies were used, and this 
would certainly have a negative impact on their value 
in the long term. Therefore, we are still trying to 
solve the knot in a non-Alexandrian way. By 
“merging” the ontologies into one, we can also 
actively support the rules of the OBO Foundry and 
provide an example of how the construction of a 
large and comprehensive ontology can, later on, 
provide advantages to its users.

Abstract 
Models of epidemics allow decision makers to 
explore the consequences of different interventions. 
The Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study 
(MIDAS) project has been collecting studies, models, 
data supporting the models, and publications 
providing historical evidence about epidemics. 
An ontology has been developed for MIDAS to 
support 
this 
collection, 
documentation, 
and 
dissemination. It uses relations to link taxonomies 
(including a subset of the infectious disease ontology) 
that define the range of potential models or 
supporting documentation. 
The ontology is used to aid in the navigation process 
that is part of the user interface for identifying which 
studies and publications are available in the MIDAS 
repository (MREP) that are consistent with the many 
parameters associated with a particular study.  
Keywords: 
Infectious 
disease 
models,

transmission, ontology, taxonomy 
Introduction 
Models of epidemics that allow decision makers to 
explore the consequences of different interventions 
are a valuable tool for public health officials. For 
these tools to be effective, the models must be 
validated and the resulting conclusions must be 
convincing to the decision makers. The process of 
creating models, designing the series of modeling 
studies needed to calibrate them, and providing 
useful feedback on the consequences of interventions 
requires 
close 
collaboration 
among 
an 
interdisciplinary team. The team must be able to 
integrate data from databases for multiple disciplines 
and understand the implications of modeling 
requirements from multiple viewpoints. The MIDAS 
program is an example of such collaboration. 
MIDAS 
MIDAS was created to help improve the nation’s 
ability to respond to biological threats promptly and 
effectively.1 MIDAS is a research partnership 
between the National Institute of General Medical 
Sciences and the scientific community to develop 
computational models for policymakers, public 
health workers, and researchers. To date, MIDAS 
primarily has developed agent-based influenza 
transmission models to assess influenza prevention 
and containment strategies that include the broad 
categories of antiviral medications, vaccines, and 
nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as case 
isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace 
closure, and travel restrictions. The models have been 
used to generate simulations to study the following: 
▪  Influenza epidemics and containment options in 
Southeast Asia2,3 
▪  The potential spread of a pandemic strain of 
influenza virus through a U.S. population of 
approximately 300 million individuals4,5 
▪  An epidemic in Chicago, Illinois.6 These 
research efforts are supported by the MIDAS 
repository (MREP), which stores and manages 
the computerized models, model results, model 
parameters, and the specifications used to 
develop the models.7 Each element in the MREP 
is cataloged in a relational database. The 
database links these elements so the inputs to a 
specific model and the corresponding results are 
connected. The ontology described herein is an 
evolving method for making this information 
more accessible to policymakers, public health 
professionals, and researchers. 
Components of an Epidemic Model 
To conduct a study, the modeler must create a 
simulation by assembling and calibrating several 
components. This usually involves a series of 
tradeoffs in terms of how these components are 
defined and how the validity of the associated 
parameter values are established. The ontology is 
designed to show the user which studies are available 
that meet the user’s requirements across the range of 
models. The ontology also assists the user in finding 
publications and other data sources that are available 
to calibrate a model meeting the user’s requirements. 
The following paragraphs describe the major 
components and indicate the scope of the ontology. 
The Disease Model 
A primary element of an agent-based epidemic model 
is a representation of the natural history of the disease 
in individuals in the model, whom we refer to as 
agents. One common approach is to represent the 
history in terms of a set of transitions between states

such as the Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) 
model. The initial conditions of an epidemic model 
place all of the agents into either a susceptible state 
or an immune state (which is a special case of the 
removed state).  Upon contact with agents in the 
infectious state, susceptible agents (S) transition to 
the infectious state (I) with a specified probability. 
After a number of days, the agents transition to the 
removed state (R). Because these agents are now 
either dead or immune to the pathogen, they remain 
in state R for the rest of the time period of interest. A 
significant step in a model’s calibration process is to 
demonstrate that the probabilities for these transitions 
in the simulation are consistent with historical data. 
Social Network Models 
A key tradeoff when constructing a model involves 
the level and nature of the population disaggregation. 
The 
social network 
model 
disaggregates 
the 
population into subgroups according to certain 
characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and provides 
behaviors for each of these subgroups. The subgroup 
behavior models include appropriate disease state– 
transition rates and likelihoods of contacts between 
infected 
and 
susceptible 
agents. 
Targeting 
interventions to specific subgroups is a critical 
element of an effective strategy for combating an 
epidemic. The social network model must be 
disaggregated to a level that distinguishes the effects 
of targeted interventions. At the same time, data 
sources are needed to substantiate the different 
subgroup models. The ontology is being developed to 
help the user make tradeoffs in the level of 
disaggregation based on the interventions and output 
resolution and available data sources.  
Social network data are combined with transportation 
data to further specify the behavior of agents. Agents 
are initially assigned to households in a manner 
consistent with census data. The transportation data 
are used in combination with census data to 
determine where the agents work or go to school. 
Where the patterns of movement are more diffuse, a 
gravity model is used that prioritizes the destinations 
based on a metric that weighs the basic attractiveness 
of a destination against the distance to be traveled to 
reach the destination. 
Some workplaces, such as hotels and hospitals, have 
special significance for epidemic models. Hotels are 
a primary location for the mixing of travelers. 
Hospitals are significant because their workers are 
more likely to come in contact with infected agents. 
Intervention Models 
The primary goal for the development of these 
models is to assist decision makers in assessing the 
expected consequences of their interventions through 
a series of “what if” studies. Part of the development 
of these “what if” studies involves modeling a 
potential set of interventions. Typical interventions 
include vaccinations; treatment of the symptomatic 
population via antiviral medications; and social 
distancing method, such as the closing of schools, 
workplaces, and public means of transportation. If 
interventions are directed at particular social 
networks (e.g., prophylactic treatment of children in a 
school), then the model must provide separate 
behaviors for each social group of interest. 
Study Design 
Constructing an epidemic model involves calibrating 
the model against historical data before running the 
“what if” analyses. The study design section of the 
ontology is being designed to indicate what historical 
data are available to calibrate a study. This section of 
the ontology also identifies what data are collected as 
part of the available studies. 
Computational Framework 
The choice of the computational framework can have 
a major impact on the computational requirements of 
a study and is, therefore, one of the most important 
decisions in the design of a study. While designing a 
study, the research community would like to be able 
to choose from a hierarchy of models—from 
calibrated differential equations to complex agent-
based model simulations.8 Different computational 
frameworks have different input data requirements. 
This section of the ontology describes what 
computational framework was used for each of the 
studies. 
An Ontology for Models of Epidemics 
Ontology Architecture 
This ontology is defined in terms of a simple high-
level entity-relationship model in which the entities 
are taxonomies constructed with IS_A and PART_OF 
relations.9 Attributes are associated with the entities, 
including lists of the publications and studies that are 
consistent with the characteristics of the entity. Each 
taxonomy has an associated class hierarchy10 that 
defines the inheritance of attributes to the lowest 
level entities and also specifies rollup rules for 
aggregating information lower in the taxonomy. The 
combination of entity relationships and attributes 
allows the ontology to communicate with source 
databases to obtain initial attribute values. The class 
hierarchies of rules allow the ontology to process 
hierarchical structures such as taxonomies.

Taxonomy Structure 
The taxonomies are constructed as class hierarchies 
with three different base relations: parts, choices, and 
options. Each of these relations has a set of functions 
associated with its class that are inherited to all 
instantiations of that relation. An instance object may 
have studies and documents associated with it. An 
abstract object may have associated documents and a 
base relation. The required parts of an object are 
specified by parts classes. Choices for an object are 
specified by choices classes. Optional components 
for an object are represented by options classes. 
Component Taxonomies 
The following taxonomies are required parts of the 
ontology built for these models: 
▪  A 
taxonomy 
of 
infectious 
diseases. This 
taxonomy uses the terminology from the 
Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) website.11 
The primary reason for using the same identifiers 
as the IDO is to link to additional information 
about diseases being developed by other IDO 
users. 
This taxonomy is represented as a 
hierarchy of choices; only one disease is 
modeled in a simulation run. 
▪  The geographic area of interest for a model. This 
is selected from a choices taxonomy with two 
levels: the scope of the region modeled and the 
instance of the region The top level choice is the 
size of the region.  The second level choice is the 
location of the region. 
▪  A taxonomy of transportation models. This 
options taxonomy describes the ways in which 
the modeled individuals move into contact with 
one another. Multiple transportation models can 
be used in a single simulation for different 
modes of transportation. 
▪  A taxonomy of interventions. This taxonomy has 
five options: vaccination, treatment, quarantine, 
social 
distancing, 
and 
other 
interventions 
addressing vectors of a disease. This is another 
potential application of IDO identifiers. 
▪  A taxonomy of social groups. This taxonomy 
includes 
households, 
workplaces, 
schools, 
communities, and group quarters as options. 
▪  A taxonomy of epidemic dates. This choices 
taxonomy is used to identify historical data. 
▪  A taxonomy of model outputs. This taxonomy 
includes options for the time resolution of trend 
analysis, levels of data aggregation, and output 
visualization methods. 
Taxonomy Dependencies 
The ontology includes dependency relations that link 
together the taxonomies. One set of dependencies 
links options to choices. For example, options for 
model outputs for school-age children implies 
appropriate interaction models for children, typically 
involving the inclusion of schools as social groups. 
Conversely, if schools are modeled as social groups, 
then school-age children become a viable output 
aggregation category. 
Another form of dependency links the model to the 
required parameters for that model and to any sources 
of historical data to calibrate those parameters. Each 
of the component taxonomies described above 
previously has an associated set of parameters. For 
example, the different genetic structures of influenza 
react differently to various vaccines, which implies 
different disease state–transition rates based on the 
pharmaceutical intervention selected. Part of the 
ontology development process involves encoding 
these dependencies as relations in the ontology so the 
ontology can ensure that the disease natural history 
parameters are consistent with the particular strain of 
influenza and the interventions being studied. 
Application of the Ontology to Support Modeling 
A User Interface 
The ontology described has been used to develop a 
user interface to identify which studies and 
publications in the MREP match an evolving 
specification for a given study. The user works 
through a set of menus arranged in terms of four 
spaces of parameters12 as follows: 
▪  The background space, where the user specifies 
the disease and geographic region of interest. 
▪  The decision space, where the user specifies the 
interventions of interest.  
▪  The situation space, where the user specifies the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
disease 
and 
initial 
conditions of the study. 
▪  The study design space, where the user defines 
the range of parameters to be varied, the metrics 
of the epidemic to be tracked, and the outputs to 
be calculated from the metrics and how they are 
to be displayed. The user also selects the 
timeframes and resolution of the study.

Benefits of an Ontology-Based User Interface 
The ontology structure provides two key benefits 
relative to a simple Boolean query processor to 
access the MREP study and publication databases. 
First, the dependencies between the taxonomies 
reduce the set of options for later menu structures. 
The menus are generated dynamically, reflecting 
earlier decisions. Given the large space of parameters 
associated with these models, there is value in using 
the relations of the ontology to reduce the number of 
options facing the user. 
Second, the taxonomies provide multiple levels of 
abstraction. This provides the user with more control 
over the space of parameters by controlling the level 
of abstraction along different dimensions. For 
example, the user may focus on only the H1N1 
influenza virus or expand the set of possible studies 
or publications of interest to include all influenza-like 
diseases (such as H5N1 flu strains). Similarly, the 
user can focus on models that represent specific 
group quarters (such as prisons or nursing homes) or 
expand the set of possible studies or publications to 
include any combination of group quarters. This 
strategy of increasing abstraction has also been used 
in defining the time period covered by historical 
studies. A researcher can focus on a specific epidemic 
year or look for historical information over the span 
of a decade or more. 
Conclusions 
This paper presents an ontology that supports the 
development of models of epidemics and their 
respective mitigating interventions. It links studies 
and publications to the parameters of computer 
models of epidemics. This ontology is in the early 
stages of development and is currently being used to 
describe the contents of the MREP. However, the 
ultimate success of the ontology will depend upon its 
ability to interface (through related ontologies) with 
bibliographies of publications describing disease 
processes and the efficacy of interventions.

Abstract 
This paper surveys preliminary results from the 
Interdisciplinary Prostate Ontology Project (IPOP), 
in which ontologies from the Open Biomedical 
Ontologies (OBO) library have been used to annotate 
clinical reports about prostate cancer. First we 
discuss 
why 
we 
rejected 
several 
controlled 
vocabularies, including SNOMED, DICOM, and 
RadLex, preferring instead to use the OBO library. 
We then briefly describe the database-backed website 
we have created around the relevant OBO 
ontologies, and provide excerpts of reports from 
radiology, surgery, and pathology which we have 
hyperlinked to the ontology terms. This method 
allows us to discover which relevant terms exist in 
the OBO library, and which do not. The final section 
of this paper discusses these gaps in the OBO library 
and considers methods of filling them. 
Introduction 
The Interdisciplinary Prostate Ontology Project aims 
to develop expertise with biomedical ontologies at 
the University of Western Ontario and the London 
Health Sciences Centre. This paper surveys results 
from the first stage of IPOP, which assessed existing 
biomedical ontology tools and applied them to 
clinical reporting about prostate cancer.    
The main goal of IPOP is to improve communication 
between medical practitioners from radiology, 
oncology, anatomy, surgery, pathology, and other 
areas. Communication is often impeded by local 
variations in the use of terminology.  Controlled 
vocabularies are part of the solution to this problem. 
Biomedical ontologies improve upon controlled 
vocabularies by linking together terms and thus 
allowing for better computerized data collection, 
search, and analysis. We hope that improving 
communication will ultimately lead to better patient 
outcomes.1 
Our first step was to assess different approaches to 
ontologies and controlled vocabularies. For reasons 
discussed below, we rejected controlled vocabularies 
including SNOMED CT, DICOM, and RadLex. Our 
preferred alternative is to use ontologies from the 
Open Biomedical Ontologies consortium, and in 
particular from their OBO Foundry initiative. OBO 
includes a network of well designed, interoperable 
ontologies, which cover a wide range of relevant 
terminology.   
We then created a database-backed website around 
the relevant OBO ontologies. Each ontology term has 
a web page describing it and linking it to parent and 
child terms via relations like “is_a” and “part_of”. 
We collected examples of radiology, surgery, and 
pathology reports dealing with prostate cancer, added 
them to our website, and hyperlinked the relevant 
terms in those reports to terms in the database of 
ontologies. Our approach is designed to reveal which 
relevant terms already exist within the OBO 
ontologies and which are not yet included in any 
OBO ontologies. We conclude this paper by 
suggesting fragments of one ontology, which would 
be useful for completing the annotation of these 
reports.  
IPOP shares much in common with Marwede and 
Fielding’s recent work on ontologies in clinical 
radiology.2 Their focus is on radiology reporting, in 
many different forms, with a view to annotating 
medical images using ontology terms. Our focus is 
on prostate cancer across medical disciplines, but we 
are also interested in extending the use of ontologies 
to medical image annotation. 
Controlled Vocabularies 
We assessed several controlled vocabularies before 
settling on OBO ontologies. This section outlines 
these alternatives and our reasons for setting them 
aside. 
SNOMED CT 
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical 
Terms (SNOMED CT) is a very large collection of 
medical terms which is becoming widely used 
throughout the world. The chief advantage of 
SNOMED is its broad coverage of terms describing 
medical practice. But SNOMED has been criticized 
for not following sound ontological theory3, and for 
including many errors of classification4. OBO and 
many Semantic Web systems show that a network of 
specialized tools is often more flexible and 
comprehensive in the long run than centralized and 
monolithic approaches like SNOMED.

DICOM 
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine 
(DICOM) is an industry driven standard for medical 
imaging files, their storage, and their transmission 
over networks. The DICOM Structured Reporting 
standard (DICOM-SR) extends DICOM to the kinds 
of textual reports considered in the first stage of 
IPOP5. DICOM covers many terms important for our 
future work on medical image annotation. But 
DICOM-SR is not yet in wide use, and since the 
terms defined in “DICOM Part 16: Content Mapping 
Resource” are largely derived from SNOMED, for 
our current purposes they share the same problems. 
RadLex 
The Radiology Lexicon (RadLex) is a controlled 
vocabulary developed by the Radiology Society of 
North America (RSNA). There are ongoing efforts to 
transform RadLex from a lexicon into an ontology6, 
and to reduce its duplication of other more 
comprehensive ontologies like the Foundational 
Model of Anatomy (FMA).7 
OBO Ontologies 
Each of the preceding tools has its strengths. In 
particular, they share a focus on the practice of 
medicine and medical interventions. However our 
group has chosen to pursue an alternative approach.  
The Open Biomedical Ontologies library includes a 
large number ontology projects, and the OBO 
Foundry initiative aims to unite them under a set of 
shared best practices.8 Each OBO Foundry ontology 
is specialized for a particular domain and designed 
by a group of experts in the relevant field. When two 
domains overlap, the goal is keep their ontologies 
separate but link them together, creating a division of 
labour. 
Advantages of the OBO Foundry ontologies include 
permissive licenses, open source practices, a human-
readable common file format, and a shared Basic 
Formal Ontology (BFO). Although many of the OBO 
ontologies are incomplete, and although there are 
many domains relevant to IPOP which are not yet 
covered by OBO, in our assessment the OBO 
Foundry approach is the best bet for future work in 
biomedical ontologies. 
Below we describe in brief some of the OBO 
ontologies which we have found useful for our goal 
of annotating clinical reports about prostate cancer in 
humans. 
•  
Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA): 
provides IPOP with terms such as FMA:9600 
“prostate”, as well as terms for the parts of the 
prostate and its neighbouring organs. 
•  
Disease Ontology (DO/DOID): parallels the 
structure of the FMA and describes diseases of 
various portion of the human anatomy. For IPOP 
the main terms of interest are DOID:47 “prostate 
disease” and its children, including DOID:514 
“prostatic 
neoplasms” 
and 
DOID:8634 
“carcinoma in situ of prostate”. 
•  
Protein Ontology (PRO): proteins like prostate 
specific antigen (PSA) are important for the 
detection of prostate cancer. 
•  
Gene Ontology (GO): provides terms related to 
PSA, 
such 
as 
GO:0004252 
“serine-type 
endopeptidase 
activity” 
and 
GO:0016525 
“negative regulation of angiogenesis”. 
•  
Phenotype Quality (PATO): designed to describe 
phenotypes of organisms, it contains many terms 
useful for qualitative assessments in general. 
Relevant to IPOP are the children of the term 
PATO:0000014 “color” used in biopsies, as well 
as terms for patterns (e.g. PATO:0000060 
“spatial 
pattern”) 
and 
textures 
(e.g. 
PATO:0000701 “smooth”). 
•  
Units of Measurement (UO): organizes the 
International System of Units (SI) into an 
ontology, and includes other terms such as 
UO:0000190 “ratio”. 
Annotating Reports 
In the first stage of IPOP our focus has been on 
annotating the text of clinical reports using ontology 
terms. These three samples come from reports on 
three separate patients. A selection of OBO terms is 
marked in bold and explained. 
Radiology Report Sample 
“Peripheral 
Zone: 
This 
zone 
is 
relatively 
homogeneous with a smooth contour although it is 
compressed by a large transition zone.” 
•  
“peripheral zone” corresponds to FMA:19587 
“peripheral zone of prostate” 
•  
“smooth” is PATO:0000701 
•  
“contour” 
corresponds 
to 
PATO:0000052 
“shape” 
•  
“transition zone” corresponds to FMA:45721 
“transition zone of prostate” 
Surgery Report Sample 
“Once the prostate was mobilized in a cephalad 
direction, I could see Denonvilliers fascia. This was 
opened in the midline. We then dissected out the 
ampulla of Vater, which were clipped and divided.

The seminal vesicles were dissected off in their 
entirety quite easily using clips for hemostasis.” 
•  
“prostate” is FMA:9600 
•  
“Denonvilliers fascia” is a synonym for 
FMA:19933 “rectovesical septum” 
•  
“ampulla 
of 
Vater” 
is 
a 
synonym 
for 
FMA:15076 “hepatopancreatic ampulla” 
•  
“seminal vesicle” is FMA:19386 
•  
“hemostasis” is GO:0007599 
Pathology Report Sample 
“The specimen consist of 2 cores of pale tan tissue, 
the larger measures 1.3 cm and the smaller measures 
1.1 cm. All tissue is submitted in one cassette.” 
•  
“pale tan” is a close synonym of PATO:0001268 
“desaturated brown” 
•  
“tissue” corresponds to FMA:9637 “portion of 
tissue” 
•  
“cm” is UO:0000015 
Gaps in OBO Ontologies 
Although the OBO ontologies provide a broad and 
rich source of terms which we have been able to use 
to annotate our reports, there are important terms 
which cannot be found in any of the existing 
ontologies. Some of these terms are included in 
SNOMED CT, DICOM, and RadLex, but have not 
yet been integrated into the OBO library. In many 
cases these gaps reflect the focus of SNOMED CT, 
DICOM, and RadLex on medical practice and 
interventions, while OBO ontologies tend to focus on 
biomedical investigations. 
Near Synonyms 
As might be expected, there are phrases used in the 
reports which do not match the name of any term in 
an OBO ontology, nor any of the synonyms given, 
but are clearly meant to refer to an existing term. The 
example above of “pale tan” is one such case. Since 
our reports are annotated by human beings and not 
automatically, it is possible to discern the author’s 
intent in most cases and add the hyperlink. Variation 
in synonyms poses a problem for automatic 
annotation methods. 
Missing Composites 
There are UO terms for density, including “milligram 
per milliliter”, but no term for “nanogram per 
milliliter” used in PSA measurements. This points to 
an issue of compositionality in UO which is shared 
by other ontologies: not all possible combinations of 
terms are included in the ontology. This can be 
remedied either by adding the composite term to the 
ontology, or by using two ontology terms linked 
together by a well-defined relation. 
Conflicting Fiat Boundaries 
Ontologies like FMA include bona fide boundaries 
like those between bones and between organs, as 
well as fiat boundaries drawn for the sake of 
convenience. While there tends to be good agreement 
about bona fide boundaries, it is easy to find 
disagreements about how fiat boundaries should be 
established. 
For instance, the FMA divides the regional parts of 
FMA:9600 “prostate” into the anterior, posterior, 
right lateral, and left lateral lobes. Each of these lobes 
is given its own child terms for fibromuscular stroma, 
vasculature, neural network, and parenchyma. But 
RadLex divides the prostate’s RID:344 “anterior 
fibromuscular stroma” into outer and inner glands, 
and then into peripheral, central, and transition zones. 
Since prostate tumours are much more common in 
the peripheral zone of the prostate, it is more natural 
to use the RadLex nomenclature than the FMA fiat 
boundaries when dealing with prostate cancer. 
Including two distinct sets of fiat boundaries is likely 
to be problematic, as is mapping a set of fiat 
boundaries in one ontology onto a different set in 
another ontology. 
Medical Procedures 
OBO does not currently include ontologies for 
describing the medical procedures relevant to IPOP. 
Also missing are terms for the tools used to perform 
these procedures.  For instance: digital rectal exam, 
transrectal ultrasound; biopsy, specimen, core, 
fragment, cassette; surgery, mobilize, dissect, clips. 
There are ontologies being developed like the 
Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) which 
may fill some of these gaps. Investigations are, of 
course, distinct from interventions, and the latter is 
the primary concern of IPOP.  
If no existing ontologies can be found to fill these 
gaps, the alternative is to coordinate with others to 
create a new ontology for these terms using OBO 
Foundry best practices, and submit it to the OBO 
consortium. 
Image Types 
Important for the radiological aspects of IPOP is an 
ontology for medical image types. Below is a 
proposed fragment of an “is_a” hierarchy for types of 
medical image. 
• Medical Image  
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Image 
• T1 Weighted MRI Image

• M Mode US Image   
• X-Ray Image 
• Computed Tomography (CT) Image 
• CT Image with Contrast 
• CT Image without Contrast 
• … 
• Nuclear Medicine Image 
• … 
RadLex and DICOM contain many useful terms for 
medical images which could be adapted into a new 
ontology. It is important to maintain the distinction 
between medical imaging procedures and the images 
which are products of those procedures. 
Conclusion 
The first stage of IPOP has been successful in 
applying the OBO library to a small set of clinical 
reports from radiology, surgery, and pathology. The 
process is labour intensive, which has limited the 
number of cases we have annotated. Nevertheless, 
the small set of annotated cases will be useful as an 
education tool, raising awareness of the availability 
of ontology and the utility of controlled vocabularies. 
Analysis of the annotated reports has also helped us 
to find examples of conflicting term usage in our 
practice. 
It is worth reiterating the difference between 
controlled vocabularies focused on medical practice, 
such as SNOMED CT, DICOM, and RadLex, and 
the OBO ontologies which focus on biomedical 
research. IPOP requires a firm foundation in 
biomedical science, but our goal is to improve 
medical practice.  The evolving shared principles of 
the OBO Foundry promise to avoid many of the 
pitfalls 
encountered 
in 
the 
other 
controlled 
vocabularies. And we believe that these shared 
principles will prove just as fruitful in the 
development of new ontologies, aimed primarily at 
medical interventions, as they have already in 
developing 
ontologies 
aimed 
at 
biomedical 
investigations. 
Our ongoing work on IPOP builds on the successes 
of this first stage by annotating sample reports from 
more fields, attempting to fill in the gaps discussed 
here, and considering the use of ontological 
annotations for medical images.

SNOMED CT’s Ontological Commitment  
Stefan Schulz1, Ronald Cornet2

Abstract 
SNOMED CT is a clinical terminology that describes 
the meaning of terms by logical axioms. This requires 
an ontological commitment, i.e. precise agreements 
about the ontological nature of the entities referred 
to. We provide evidence that SNOMED implicitly 
supports 
at 
least 
three 
different 
kinds 
of 
commitments, viz. (i) independently existing entities, 
(ii) representational artifacts, and (iii) clinical 
situations. Our analysis shows how the truth-value of 
a sentence changes according to one of these 
perspectives. We argue that a clear understanding of 
to what kind of entities SNOMED CT concepts extend 
is crucial for the proper use and maintenance of 
SNOMED CT. 
Introduction 
SNOMED CT1 is the inheritor of a dynasty of 
medical nomenclatures and coding systems2 which 
had been constructed to provide: 
1.  Semantic descriptors to annotate and encode 
clinical procedures, diagnoses, observables, etc.; 
2.  Standardized 
medical 
terms 
in 
different 
languages; 
3.  Guidance for the construction of composed 
terminological expressions.  
SNOMED CT’s predecessors made only very 
basic claims with respect to the domain they 
represented. The meaning of semantic descriptors 
was given by the intuitive understanding of the terms 
they were linked to and it was assumed that they 
were correctly interpreted by the (human) language 
users. Therefore, none of these systems made any 
attempt to formally represent any reality beyond a 
rough mapping of controlled terms to shared 
concepts with the aim to reduce the high variability 
of human language through a set of controlled terms 
or to support the encoding of medical data by means 
of a coded thesaurus of procedural and administrative 
terms.  
With the advent of SNOMED RT (and later 
SNOMED CT), logics entered the scene and added a 
mathematically rigorous layer to the hitherto 
informal, close-to-human-language representation of 
medical terms. However, the use of logic axioms and 
theorems in a terminology (which imposes the 
assignment of truth-values) requires an equally 
precise agreement about the objects and relations 
being denoted by the terms and concepts. This is 
commonly called ontological commitment3. 
In this paper we will substantiate the claim that 
SNOMED 
CT’s 
ontological 
commitment 
is 
inconsistent. To this end we will scrutinize three 
frequent SNOMED CT design features, viz. (i) 
qualifiers and their values, (ii) context-dependent 
concepts, and (iii) multiple parenthood.  
Furthermore, we will discuss the pros and cons 
of the inferences they enable and discuss them in the 
light of competing ontological commitments.  
Description Logics 
SNOMED CT’s backbone is given by a taxonomy of 
nodes, called SNOMED CT concepts. Every concept 
represents the characteristic properties of all its 
(concrete) instances. This is done by a parsimonious 
variant of description logics (DL)4, which we will 
briefly introduce. Key notions in DL are classes and 
instances (their extensions). So is the class Liver 
instantiated by every individual liver, just as Bodily 
Organ extends to all individual bodily organs. Putting 
those two statements together, we get the hierarchy-
building principle of taxonomic subsumption: Liver 
is subsumed by Bodily Organ. In DL this is expressed 
by Liver ⊑ Bodily Organ, which asserts that every 
Liver instance is also an instance of Bodily Organi. 
More complex statements can be obtained by 
combining representations of classes with operators 
and quantifiers. In the following example, we employ 
the ⊓ (“and”) operator and add a quantified role, 
using the existential quantifier ∃ (“exists”). For 
example, the expression Inflammatory disease ⊓ ∃ 
has location.Liver extends to all instances in which 
both instantiate Inflammatory disease and are further 
related through the relation has location to some 
Liver. This example actually gives us both the 
necessary and the sufficient conditions needed in 
order 
to 
fully 
define 
a 
class, 
e.g.: 
Hepatitis 
≡ 
Inflammatory 
disease 
⊓ 
∃ 
has-location.Liver, with the equivalence operator ≡ 
telling that (i) every particular instance of Hepatitis is 
also an instance of Inflammatory disease that is 
located at some instance of Liver, and (ii) that every 
instance of Inflammatory disease that is located at 
iAnother way of referring to taxonomic subsumption (DL operator 
⊑) is the use a relation named “is-a”

some Liver is an instance of Hepatitis. Hence, in any 
situation, the term on the left can be replaced by the 
expression on the right without any loss of meaning. 
Running Examples 
Having 
introduced 
SNOMED 
CT's 
formal 
background 
we 
will 
base 
our 
forthcoming 
deliberations on four examples taken from the 
January 2009 release of SNOMED CT. All these 
examples are representative as the phenomena they 
incorporate 
occur 
frequently 
throughout 
the 
terminology. 
1. Infusion Pump 
(430033006), a primitive concept in the Physical 
object branch: 
Infusion pump ⊑ Pump ⊑ Instrument, device ⊑ … ⊑ 
Physical object. All SNOMED CT concepts are 
inserted in this kind of subsumption hierarchies. 
2. Denied Tonsillectomy 
(173422009|: 
272125009|= 
82975001), 
a 
postcoordinated concept, refining tonsillectomy by 
using the qualifier "priority" with the value "denied", 
in DL notation: Tonsillecomy ⊓ ∃ Priority.Denied. 
All SNOMED CT procedure concepts (~50,000) 
allow analogous refinements.  
3. Heart Operation Planned 
(183983001). This concept is in SNOMED CT’s 
Situation with explicit context branch and is fully 
defined as 
∃ rg.( ∃ associated_procedure.Operation on heart ⊓ 
∃ procedure_context.Planned ⊓ 
∃ subject_rel_ context. Subject of record ⊓ 
∃ temporal_context.Current or specified time) ii 
There are currently 17 concepts with the context 
Planned, but hundreds with similar contexts such as 
Suspected or Known Absent. 
4. Tetralogy of Fallot 
(86299006). This concept is subsumed by the four 
concepts: Pulmonic valve stenosis, Ventricular septal 
defect, Overriding aorta, and Right ventricular 
hypertrophy. More precisely, it implies the following 
expression: 
∃ rg.( ∃ assoc_morphology.Congenital Anomaly ⊓ 
∃ finding_site.Cardiac Ventricular Structure) ⊓ 
∃ rg. (∃ assoc_morphology.Defect ⊓ 
∃ finding_site.Intraventricular Septum Structure) ⊓ 
∃ rg. (∃ assoc_morphology.Stenosis ⊓ 
∃ finding_site.Pulmonary Valve Structure) ⊓ 
∃ rg. (∃ assoc_morphology.Overriding Structures ⊓ 
∃ finding_site.Thoracic Aorta Structure) 
Nearly 77,000 SNOMED CT concepts contain 
relationship groups.  
rg means „role group“, cf.6 
Using these examples we now want to 
demonstrate the different ontological commitments 
occurring in SNOMED CT. In other words, we will 
ask the question: which entities in the clinical context 
are instantiated by SNOMED CT concepts? Below 
we present three possibilities: independently existing 
entities, representational artifacts, and clinical 
situations. 
SNOMED CT concepts are instantiated by objects 
that exist independently of the clinical context 
We will call this the standard interpretation, as it is 
the most straightforward one and corresponds to the 
view commonly defended by the realist approach to 
ontologies. This stance postulates the existence of 
real objects and processes as independent of the 
circumstances of their observation5. 
Under this viewpoint, the concept Infusion 
pump would be instantiated by each and every 
individual infusion pump, independent of its 
involvement in any clinical process. It would not 
designate the mental concept or construction plan of 
an infusion pump. In the same line, the concept 
Tonsillectomy would be instantiated by every really 
occurring surgical removal of a tonsil. Heart 
operation planned would denote a plan of a heart 
operation as the result of a real physician’s decision, 
and 
Pulmonary 
Valve 
Stenosis 
morphologically 
altered 
state 
of 
an 
pulmonary valve in a real patient.  
would 
existing 
SNOMED CT concepts are instantiated by 
representational artifacts as contained in an 
electronic patient record 
We will call this the EHR interpretation. Under this 
view it does not matter whether some thing really 
exists or not. The only criterion is a mention in a 
documentation artifact such as an electronic patient 
record (EHR). This can be nicely shown by the 
postcoordinated SNOMED CT concept Denied 
tonsillectomy. It is not instantiated by a real 
tonsillectomy but by an EHR entry on tonsillectomy, 
an information object which may be further refined 
by qualifiers such as Denied, Planned, Scheduled. 
Under this point of view, an EHR entry "denied 
tonsillectomy" is indeed subsumed by the entry 
"tonsillectomy", so that this sentence holds true. How 
such an entry is interpreted by the EHR used in terms 
of what things in reality it denotes is not relevant 
here. But it is obvious that on the level of real objects 
and processes a denied tonsillectomy can never be a 
kind of tonsillectomy, so that the sentence is false at 
the level of real objects. 
A similar line of reasoning applies to the example 
Heart operation planned. Although this concept is 
56

not a subconcept of Heart operation (which would 
parallel 
the 
above 
example), 
its 
standard 
interpretation leads to contradictions: According to 
its definition, Heart operation planned implies the 
sentence: 
∃ associated_procedure.Operation on heart. 
Following the description logics semantics this 
means that for each instance of Heart operation 
planned there must be at least one instance of 
Operation on heart. This contention can easily be 
disproved as planned procedures are not always 
executed. If Heart operation planned, on the 
contrary, is interpreted as to be instantiated by EHR 
objects, the sentence becomes true, using the same 
argument we used to justify the subsumption relation 
between Tonsillectomy and Denied tonsillectomy. 
SNOMED CT concepts are instantiated by patients 
or clinical situations. 
Typical examples that suggest this third flavor of 
interpreting SNOMED CT concepts is suggested by 
the way SNOMED CT formalizes composed clinical 
findings and procedures. The standard interpretation 
conflicts with the fact that all elements of a combined 
finding, such as the complex heart malformation 
called Tetralogy of Fallot are introduced as its 
taxonomic parents. As a result, Tetralogy of Fallot is 
subsumed by the concepts Septal defect and 
Cardiomegaly, 
among 
others. 
Furthermore, 
SNOMED CT separated the findings from the 
morphology using so-called relationship groups. 
According to6, role groups are expressed in DL as an 
anonymous relation called rg. 
Role groups order the elements of a complex 
concept definition and prevent it from ambiguous 
associations. If we re-interpret rg as has_part as 
proposed by7 there is little to criticize from an 
ontological point of view. However, role groups also 
appear in definitions where the reason is not obvious, 
e.g. 
Pulmonic Valve Stenosis ≡
∃ rg. 
(∃ assoc_morphology.Stenosis ⊓ 
∃ finding_site.Pulmonary Valve Structure) 
Let us rephrase this equivalence, taking 
description logics semantics seriously: 
“Every pulmonic valve stenosis has some part which 
exhibits at least one stenosis somewhere at a 
pulmonary valve; and everything having some part 
which exhibits at least one stenosis somewhere at a 
pulmonary valve is a pulmonic valve stenosis”. 
Whereas the first phrase sounds somewhat circular, 
the second one expands the concept of pulmonic 
valve stenosis to an extent that each and every 
condition which is characterized, among other things, 
by a stenotic pulmonary valve, is subsumed by the 
concept Pulmonic Valve Stenosis. It is no wonder that 
in the SNOMED CT hierarchy, this concept does not 
only subsume Congenital Stenosis of Pulmonary 
Valve, but also Pulmonic Valve Stenosis With 
Insufficiency, Tetralogy of Fallot and Pentalogy of 
Fallot. 
Coming back to the question of ontological 
commitment: if we understand by the extension of 
the concept Pulmonic Valve Stenosis the pathological 
structure as it exists in a patient, then we can’t but 
reject the view that a Tetralogy of Fallot is a kind of 
Pulmonic Valve Stenosis. What should be criticized 
here is that implication is mistaken for subsumption: 
Of course, for every Tetralogy of Fallot there is some 
Pulmonic Valve Stenosis. However, this does not 
mean that Tetralogy of Fallot is related to Pulmonic 
Valve Stenosis by taxonomic subsumption.  
The puzzle can be solved if we substitute the 
standard interpretation by what we will call here the 
epidemiological interpretation. Under this assumption, 
disorders and finding concepts do not extend to states 
or processes but to their participants or bearers, i.e. to 
patients. Hence, Pulmonic Valve Stenosis and Tetralogy 
of Fallot are to be read as “patients with a pulmonic 
valve stenosis” and “Fallot patients”. Then the 
subsumption statement becomes true: Every Fallot 
patient is also a patient with a Pulmonic Valve Stenosis. 
The picture is also consistent if we assume that 
these 
SNOMED 
concepts 
extend 
to 
clinical 
situations8 rather than to particular disorders or 
states. Consequently, we can argue that every clinical 
situation that includes a Tetralogy of Fallot also 
includes a Pulmonic Valve Stenosis, paralleling the 
argument that the set of patients with Tetralogy of 
Fallot forms a subset of the bearers of a Pulmonic 
Valve Stenosis.  
Even the EHR interpretation makes sense here, as 
it is plausible that all records annotated by Tetralogy 
of Fallot should by considered as being annotated by 
Pulmonic Valve Stenosis. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
As much as we may find good explanations for the 
discussed types of SNOMED CT modeling decisions 
we raise our concern in view of the fact that the 
different ontological commitments are completely 
implicit and the choice is up to the user. As long there 
is no agreement on which SNOMED CT concepts 
extend to objects in clinical reality, to patients, to 
situations, or to documentation objects, different 
users may want to express different things by using 
the same expressions, and misinterpretations may 
lead to erroneous conclusions. To give just one 
example: If the same concept is instantiated to 
57

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
express plans (which always bear the possibility of 
not being realized) on the one hand and to express 
actions that have been realized, hospital statistics will 
become  unreliable.  
SNOMED CT provides the means to represent 
situative scenarios that include not only plans and 
negative contexts but also other contextual “moods” 
like “suspected” “at risk” or “unknown”. This crosses 
the “ontology - epistemology divide” extends the 
boundary of what a clinical terminology should 
represent and therefore overlaps with the realm of 
information models. The resulting problems with 
double negations have been intensively discussed in 
the context of TERMINFO10. 
We therefore defend the position that SNOMED 
CT should always subscribe to what we named 
standard interpretation, as it makes no background 
assumptions and is compatible with the approaches 
pursued by many other biomedical ontologies, e.g. 
the ones of the OBO foundry. SNOMED concepts 
should clearly extend to objects in clinical reality, viz. 
the anatomical structures, the diseases, and the 
procedures as they occur in patients. 
Wherever patients, situations, documentation 
objects or plans are referred to, this should be made 
clear in the concept name. For queries that target 
situations or patients as bearer of disorders but not 
the 
disorders 
themselves, 
SNOMED 
CT’s 
postcoordination syntax allows to express this, e.g. by 
∃ bearer-of. Pulmonic Valve Stenosis or ∃ bearer-of. 
Tetralogy of Fallot. Using a right-identity rule such as 
bearer-of * has-part ⊑  bearer-of would then allow 
to infer that every Fallot patient has a stenosis of the 
pulmonic valve even if the problematic assertion 
Tetralogy of Fallot 
⊑ 
Pulmonic valve stenosis 
were removed from SNOMED CT.  For the encoding 
of epistemic aspects of the EHR, such as scheduled 
or cancelled procedures, the consistent use of an 
information model (e.g. HL7 or openEHR) should be 
preferred over the idiosyncratic use of logic-based 
formalism in a clinical terminology. 
Furthermore, SNOMED CT should ensure that 
any qualifier that can be or is attached to concepts is 
a pure restriction of the concept it qualifies, and not a 
modification of this concept, as is the case in 
“Priority: Denied”. If SNOMED CT aims to provide 
a way to encode such an information (rather than 
leaving this task to be solved by an information 
model), it must be represented in a more consistent 
way. Denied tonsillectomy would then not be a 
subclass of tonsillectomy, but a subclass of Denial. 
Allowing post-coordinating Denial with a procedure 
then provides a workable way to specify denied 
procedures using SNOMED CT only.

Abstract 
Malaria is one of the most common infectious 
diseases and an enormous public health problem in 
Sub-Sahara Africa, Asia and parts of America. In this 
paper, we discuss the development of the Human 
Malaria Control Ontology (HMCO) which contains 
general information on Malaria and epidemiological 
information that can help in the formulation of 
effective malaria control policies. The HMCO is 
aimed at providing interoperability support for the 
knowledge 
management 
of 
malaria 
control 
initiatives, and serve as an open semantic web 
infrastructure for malaria research and treatment. 
Introduction 
Ontology is a formal explicit representation of the 
conceptualization of a domain that provides a 
platform for the sharing and reuse of knowledge 
across 
heterogeneous 
platforms. 
An 
ontology 
contains semantic descriptions of the features of a 
domain  using concepts and relationship abstractions 
in a way that is readable by both man and machine. 
In recent times, the use of ontology have gained 
increasing relevance in the biomedical domain in that 
it enables researchers to stay abreast of current 
biomedical 
knowledge 
and 
promotes 
the 
understanding of such information. They also 
facilitate the sharing and reuse of biomedical 
knowledge across heterogeneous platforms for the 
delivery of medical services and implementation of 
health-related policies 1. 
Malaria is one of most worrisome vector-borne 
diseases that affect humans. It is caused by the 
parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Malaria is endemic 
in the tropical regions and sub-tropical regions of the 
world which are mainly in the South East Asia, 
Middle East Asia, Central and South America, and 
Sub-Sahara Africa. Millions of malaria cases are 
reported each year, killing over one million per year 
in Sub-Sahara Africa2. Generally, the control of a 
vector-borne disease such as malaria pose a critical 
challenge due to a number of reasons: 1) the complex 
nature of its transmission which involves three 
entities, which are the host (human), vector (female 
anopheles mosquito) and pathogens (Plasmodium 
specie); 2) the complicated epidemiology through the 
vector; and 3) social problems (poverty), geography, 
and resistance of pathogens to insecticides. All of 
these challenges compel the need to complement 
existing biomedical approaches of tackling the spread 
of vector-borne diseases with readily accessible, 
interoperable, 
and 
semantically-rich 
knowledge 
management support. This challenge motivated our 
pursuit of developing an ontology-based support for 
human malaria control. The Human Malaria Control 
Ontology (HMCO) contains information on human 
malaria that can be leveraged for the formulation of 
human malaria control initiatives in Sub-Sahara 
Africa. In terms of benefits the HCMO is expected 
to: 1) provide an interoperable platform for accessing 
malaria epidemiology information over the web; 2) 
provide information support for malaria control 
research and formulation of malaria control policy 
initiatives; and 3) Create an interoperable platform 
for the sharing and reuse of knowledge on malaria. 
The outline of the rest of this paper is given as 
follows. In Section 2 an overview of related work on 
medical ontologies is presented. Section 3 is a short 
description of the design and implementation of the 
HMCO. Section 4 is a discussion of the possible 
application of the HMCO, while the paper is 
concluded in Section 5 with an outlook of future 
work. 
Related Work 
Medical Ontologies have played useful roles in 
facilitating the re-use, dissemination and sharing of 
patient information across disparate platforms. Also, 
they have been used in semantic–based statistical 
analysis of medical data. Examples of medical 
ontologies include GALEN3, UMLS4, MeSH5, ON96, 
Tambis7, 
The 
Systematized 
Nomenclature 
of 
Medicine8,9, Foundational Model of Anatomy9, 
MENELAS 
ontology9, 
Gene 
Ontology10 
and 
LinKBase11. 
The NBCO’s Bio-portal12 consist of 
more than 50 bio-ontologies that span several aspects 
of bio-medicine including diseases, biological 
processes, plant, human, bio-medical resources etc. 
However, none of the ontologies in the bio-portal is 
specifically dedicated to malaria control. The work 
by Hadzic and Chang1 was based on providing 
interoperability support for research in, and diagnosis 
of human disease using ontology-based approach. A 
prototype 
Generic 
Human 
Disease 
Ontology 
(GenDO) that contains common general information 
regarding human diseases was created which 
captured the information in four dimensions. 
However the dimension of diseases control was not 
included.

The Infectious Diseases Ontology (IDO)13 is 
designed to make infectious diseases-relevant data 
derived from different sources comparable and 
computable. It also provides coverage of entities that 
are common to many infectious diseases. The Vector-
borne disease ontology14 is an ongoing project that is 
designed to provide an integrated interoperable 
platform for the sharing and reuse of knowledge 
about a group of vector-borne diseases in which the 
MalIDO (Malaria IDO) is a first step. The MalIDO 
incorporates several information dimensions such as 
gene models for A.gambie, Anatomy of mosquito, 
insecticide-resistance, and physiological processes of 
mosquito.  As a contribution our work in the HMCO 
specifically 
focuses 
on 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
interoperable 
platform 
that 
gives 
access 
to 
epidemiological information on malaria in Sub-
Sahara Africa that can be used for the formulation of 
malaria control policies. 
Description of the HMCO 
The HMCO captures information on human malaria 
in 7 dimensions. These are:  (1) Malaria vectors (2) 
Malaria types, (3) Malaria parasites, (4) Malaria 
Symptoms, (5) Malaria treatment (prevention, 
therapy), (6) Epidemiology data on malaria, and (7) 
Malaria Control.  The design of HMCO was based on 
the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) foundry 
principles15, while OBO foundry naming conventions 
were also adopted significantly in naming its 
concepts. It was implemented as an OWL ontology 
using the Protégé 3.4 Ontology tool. The conceptual 
taxonomy of the HMCO consists of 97 class 
abstractions that cover the seven dimensions of our 
interest. Nine disjoint subclasses comprising vector, 
treatment, continent, type, parasite, epidemiology-
info, symptom, year_data, and control were modelled 
as constituents of the superclass human_malaria 
using ‘belongTo’ object property. The subclasses for 
the three classes: symptom, treatment, and continent 
were modelled as OWL value partitions (viz. each of 
the classes was represented as comprising disjointed 
subclasses that cover all known instances of each 
class). 
Concepts relationships among classes 
(concepts) in the HMCO class hierarchy were 
represented using object property abstractions that 
define the nature of association between the classes. 
These include associations between parasite and 
vector 
(‘hasVector’), 
type 
and 
symptom 
(‘hasSymptom’), 
type 
and 
malaria_therapy 
(‘hasTherapyDrug’), type and malaria_prevention 
(‘hasPreventionDrug’), 
type 
and 
parasite 
(‘isCausedby’), 
parasite 
and 
malaria_therapy 
(‘isCuredby’), 
parasite 
and 
malaria_prevention 
(‘isPreventedby), vector and continent (‘isFrom), 
epidemiology_info 
and 
year_data 
(‘hasEpidemydata’) etc. 
The class hierarchy and 
description of entities in the HMCO is shown in 
Table 1 (appendix).  Also, specific object properties 
and datatype properties in the HMCO have 
appropriate cardinality restrictions imposed on them 
in order to effectively capture the semantics of 
relationships among the classes in the HMCO. Figure 
1  is a view of the class hierarchy of the HMCO. 
Application of the HMCO 
Currently, the HMCO knowledgebase is being 
populated with available data (at present we have 
epidemiological data on malaria from the year 1999 
to 2003 for 16 countries in Sub-Sahara Africa), while 
the data gathering process is still ongoing. At the 
completion of the first version of the HMCO, it is 
expected to serve as a web-based repository for 
accessing epidemiology information on malaria in 
Sub-Sahara Africa.  As a first step to attaining this, a 
prototype semantic web application has been built 
that can be used to query the HMCO knowledgebase. 
The Java programming language implementation 
technology was engaged in building the prototype 
semantic web application using the NetBeans Java 
IDE. The Web GUI that facilitates client interaction 
with the HMCO knowledgebase was implemented 
using Macro Media Flash and Dream Weaver web 
design tools, and Java Server Pages (JSP). The 
business logic for querying the HMCO was 
implemented as an Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 
component that is invoked from a Java Servlet class 
running on Sun Application Web Server 9.0. The 
EJB makes use of Protégé ontology Java APIs to 
access the HMCO knowledgebase for information 
retrieval. The Pellet 1.5 Descriptive Logics (DL) 
reasoned was used as the OWL DL reasoner16 to 
facilitate semantic web reasoning (entailment, 
subsumption, and ABox reasoning) on the classes 
and individuals in the HMCO.  
Conclusion 
In this paper, a description of the Human Malaria 
Control Ontology (HMCO) has been presented. The 
HMCO offers as its contribution, an interoperable 
platform for accessing epidemiological information 
on malaria as viable knowledge management 
infrastructure for malaria control policy formulation 
and research in Sub-Sahara Africa. Though still an 
ongoing work, a preliminary test of the usability of 
the HMCO has been undertaken with promising 
results. Subsequently, the HMCO will incorporate 
other dimensions of information on malaria by 
importing relevant ontologies like the IDO and the 
Vector-borne diseases ontology (particularly the 
MalIDO) and will be presented for submission to the 
bio-ontology portal for open access and evaluation.

Abstract 
This paper addresses a family of issues surrounding 
the biological phenomenon of resistance and its 
representation in realist ontologies. Resistance terms 
from various existing ontologies are examined and 
found to be either overly narrow, inconsistent, or 
otherwise problematic. We propose a more coherent 
ontological representation using the antibiotic 
resistance in Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSa) as a case study. 
Introduction: IDO, SaIDO, and MRSa 
The phenomenon of resistance is an important feature 
of biological reality, encompassing phenomena such 
as the resistance of an individual to specific diseases, 
the resistance of disorders to specific treatments, and 
the resistance of certain pathogens to certain drugs. 
As such, resistance is a phenomenon that needs to be 
captured in biomedical ontologies. 
The Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) consortium 
is developing a set of interoperable ontologies that 
together are intended to provide coverage of the 
infectious disease domain. At the core of the set is 
IDO itself, which provides a representation of all of 
these types of entities, drawn from both the 
biomedical and the clinical domains that are relevant 
to infectious diseases in general. Domain-specific 
extensions (e.g., pathogen-specific extensions) of this 
core IDO complete the set by providing ontology 
coverage of entities relevant to specific sub-domains 
of the infectious disease field. IDO is itself an 
extension of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). 
The Staphylococcus aureus Infectious Disease 
Ontology (SaIDO) is an extension of IDO concerning 
Staph aureus (Sa) infection. Sa can be partitioned 
into 
two 
subtypes: 
Methicillin-Susceptible 
Sa 
(MSSa) and Methicillin-Resistant Sa (MRSa). The 
latter subtype is a defined class that is distinguished 
by its resistance to methicillin (and other β-lactam 
antibiotics). Due to its rapid evolution in the face of 
antibiotic selective pressures, MRSa has become the 
paradigm of resistance (a so-called “superbug”), and 
has drawn significant attention from NIAID/NIH, 
CDC, and biomedical researchers throughout the 
developed world. 
Subtypes of Sa can also be specified by assigning 
bacterial strains to clonal complexes based on 
genotypic differences. Variants can differ in their 
degree of resistance and in the types of drug to which 
they are resistant, forming a continuum, in terms of 
which Sa can be (and is) categorized. This provides 
one powerful reason to produce an ontologically 
correct representation of resistance. 
In this communication, we consider the issues arising 
from the representation of resistance in realist 
ontologies and specifically, in IDO. We will focus 
our attention on the antibiotic resistance of MRSa to 
methicillin as a case-study. 
Ontological Issues Stemming from Resistance 
An 
important 
principle 
for 
realist 
ontology 
development is to avoid as far as possible the use of 
negative differentia (e.g., ‘nonphysical’, ‘not part of 
the heart’) in formulating definitions. This “positivity 
design principle” enforces the use of terms which 
capture information about the entities represented in 
the ontology rather than information about the state 
of our knowledge at some given time.1 
At some level, however, resistance seems to require a 
negative aspect for its description. After all, a 
continuant is resistant precisely when something does 
not happen. John’s resistance to marriage entails a 
host of processes that do not happen (for example, 
John does not buy an engagement ring, does not get a 
marriage license, and so forth). In the case of MRSa, 
resistance to methicillin entails that a process of cell 
wall formation is not interfered with. The key is that 
the implicit negativity of resistance is only a semantic 
feature of the description at some level. The 
biological phenomenon of resistance is manifested at 
various levels of biological reality: genes, cells and 
their parts, organisms, and populations. Negative 
descriptions at a macro-scale here mask the positive 
and active aspects of resistance at the micro-scale. A 
comprehensive 
ontological 
treatment 
must, 
accordingly consider resistance at different levels of 
granularity.  
In BFO-based ontologies, the lacks relation can be 
used to capture negative findings at one scale of 
biological description while avoiding the problems of 
using negative predicates or characteristics.2 In

describing resistance, we will have a need to say that 
an independent continuant does not exhibit a 
dependent continuant. As we will see below, this 
amounts to an independent continuant lacking a 
certain disposition.  
Resistance is referred to by several disciplines: 
epidemiologists describe the spread of resistance in a 
population, the medical community speaks of patient 
resistance to disease and pathogen resistance to 
drugs, and geneticists make reference to the genes 
that confer resistance when certain alleles are 
present. The IDO suite of ontologies must capture all 
of these discipline-specific aspects of resistance and 
the relations between them. 
Resistance in Existing Ontologies 
We surveyed the treatment of resistance in existing 
ontologies.  
Gene Ontology (GO). A general treatment of 
resistance is outside the scope of the GO, as 
resistance is not a biological process, molecular 
function, or cellular component. Within the sub-
ontology of biological processes, however, GO 
contains the term ‘response to drug’, with synonyms 
‘drug resistance’ and ‘drug susceptibility/resistance’. 
[GO:0042493] Response to Drug: A change in state 
or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of 
movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene 
expression, etc.) as a result of a drug stimulus. 
This treatment is inadequate because the narrower 
term “drug resistance” is made a synonym of the 
broader term “response to drug”. Resistance arises 
spontaneously as the result of genetic diversification. 
The presence of the drug provides a fitness advantage 
to those cells or viral particles that have the 
resistance conferring gene or mutation, thus they 
outcompete 
the 
susceptible 
individuals. 
The 
resistance is not a direct response to the drug 
stimulus, although the manifestation of resistance 
may be a consequence of exposure to the drug. A 
response to a drug is a process, whereas resistance is 
a continuant. This error (although GO usually is very 
good at preventing this confusion), arises from an 
inadequate analysis of resistance. Finally, the GO 
definition of drug resistance seems to hinge on a 
‘change in state’, but cells which do not change state 
are manifesting a ‘response to a drug’ just as much as 
those which do.  
NCI Thesaurus. The NCI Thesaurus has the 
following entry for ‘resistance’: 
[C19391] 
Resistance: 
Natural 
or 
acquired 
mechanisms, functions, activities, or processes 
exhibited by an organism to maintain immunity to, 
or to resist the effects of, an antagonistic agent, e.g., 
pathogenic microorganism, toxin, drug. 
The primary problems with this treatment of 
resistance are that: i) the definition is circular, since it 
uses ‘resist’ in defining ‘resistance’, and ii) the term 
‘resistance’ is a child of “resistance process”, making 
resistance a process, as in the GO, and excluding 
many types of resistance, because the definition of 
‘resistance process’ is biased towards multicellular 
organism resistance mediated by host defense 
mechanisms.  
SNOMED-CT. SNOMED-CT contains the entry 
‘drug resistance (disorder)’ with two defining 
relationships: 
Drug Resistance Is a Drug-Related Disorder 
Drug Resistance has Causative Agent (Attribute) 
Drug or Medicament. 
With a parent term like ‘drug-related disorder’, it is 
clear that this definition is given from the perspective 
of the patient. From the perspective of a pathogen 
(qua organism) or tumor, for example, drug 
resistance is not a disorder, but rather a benefit. Also, 
the definition specifies that drug resistance is caused 
by a drug, but resistance is caused typically by the 
presence of a gene or mutation. It is only the 
manifestation of resistance that results from the 
presence of the drug. Finally, as with other terms in 
SNOMED, only necessary but not sufficient 
conditions for drug resistance are provided. Good 
definitions should spell out both. 
Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO). IDO includes 
the term ‘protective resistance’, the definition of 
which attempts to address some of these problems: 
Protective resistance is a disposition that inheres in 
an organism by virtue of the fact that the organism 
has a part (e.g., a gene product), the disposition of 
which is to ensure a physiologic response of a 
certain degree to a potentially damaging entity P, or 
to prevent the completion of some process caused 
by P, thereby protecting the organism from or 
mitigating the damaging effects of P. 
In the next section, we describe the ontological case 
study that helped lead us to this definition. 
Towards a More Robust Ontological Treatment  
To better understand the representational demands 
posed by resistance (and to expose the problems 
raised by this and similar phenomena from an 
ontological point of view), it will be useful to go 
through a detailed example. We choose drug 
resistance for a single combination of pathogen, 
antibiotic, and resistance-mechanism types. In this 
section we will sketch the outlines of a formal

representation of the resistance of MRSa to 
methicillin as conferred by PBP2a, a penicillin 
binding protein (PBP) and a product of the gene 
mecA. Both methicillin and penicillin are β-lactam 
antibiotics and, for the purposes of our formalization, 
a PBP can be considered to be a methicillin binding 
protein. Chambers3 gives a concise description of this 
form of resistance: “[M]ethicillin resistance in 
staphylococci is due to expression of PBP2a, a novel, 
low-affinity PBP for which there is no homologue in 
methicillin-susceptible strains”. We formalize this 
information as a set of triples expressing the relevant 
ontological relationships. We also include a series of 
inference rules that would lead a logic-driven 
reasoner to deduce from the triples that MRSa is 
resistant to methicillin. Alongside the statistical 
techniques employed in biology, it will one day be 
desirable for automated reasoners to compute 
antibiotic resistance from logical formalizations. 
Using ontologies as predictive tools will guide 
treatment decisions and support automated drug 
discovery. 
The terms used in our representation will be derived 
from IDO, GO, and the Protein Ontology. The 
relations used are drawn from the OBO Relation 
Ontology 
(RO) 
and 
its 
extensions 
(see 
http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/). Naïvely, we could 
introduce a new relation resistant_to and represent 
the entire situation as MRSa resistant_to methicillin. 
However, this would hide the complexity of the 
mechanisms of resistance working at a smaller scale 
and elminate many important inferences about 
resistance. Also, it is important to avoid a 
proliferation of relations in the OBO Foundry, since 
restriction to a small set of relations promotes reuse 
and interoperability of the constituent ontologies.  
A more faithful representation requires at least the 
following components (where is_a and has_part are 
used for relations between both continuant and 
occurent universals): 
[1]  bacterium is_a organism 
[2]  MRSa is_a bacterium 
[3]  synthesis_of_peptidoglycan is_a process and 
has_participant Penicillin_Binding_Protein (PBP) 
[4]  PBP has_function_realized_as_process  
synthesis_of_peptidoglycan  
[5]  Bacterial_cell_wall is_location_of PBP 
[6]  Canonically, synthesis_of_peptidoglycan 
results_in_development_of bacterial_cell_wall 
[7]  formation_of_bacterial_cell_wall is_a process 
[8]  PBP2a is_a PBP 
[9]  methicillin_PBP_binding_process is_a binding 
process that has_participants methicillin and PBP 
[10]  affinity_to_methicillin disposition_of some PBP to 
undergo a methicillin_PBP_binding_process that is 
realized in the presence of a methicillin. 
[11]  methicillin_PBP_binding_process 
negatively_regulates synthesis_of_peptidoglycan. 
[12]  PBP2a lacks affinity_to_methicillin 
[13]  mecA is_a gene 
[14]  MRSa has_part mecA 
[15]  mecA generically_specifies PBP2a_production 
[16]  PBP2a_production results_in_formation_of PBP2a 
These triples will be used along with several rules of 
inference and derived facts (labeled IRn and Dn 
respectively in what follows). For readability, all 
variables are italicized and initial universal quantifier 
symbols are suppressed. First, we specify that is_a 
and has_part (for both continuants and occurrents) 
are transitive, allowing us to derive some basic 
taxonomic facts about the domain: 
(IR1) x is_a y & y is_a z → x is_a z 
(IR2) x has_part y & y has_part z → x has_part z 
(D1) MRSa is_a organism  
The parts of an organism are the products of the 
organism’s expressed genes, and these products are 
located in the appropriate places: 
(IR3) (o is_a organism & g is_a gene & o has_part g & 
g generically_specifies proc & 
proc results_in_formation_of prod & 
o has_part locp & locp is_location_of prod) → 
o has_part prod located_in locp 
(D2) MRSa has_part PBP2a located_in bacterial_cell_wall  
The inference rule (IR3) makes a few simplifying 
assumptions. Since not all genes are expressed, we 
are only modeling the situation in which g is an 
expressed gene. We also assume that the process proc 
leading to prod is active, and that the single gene g 
generically specifies proc (rather than a set of genes). 
If a continuant lacks a disposition to undergo a 
process in some situation, and that process negatively 
regulates a second process which has the continuant 
as a participant, then the continuant participates in 
the second process in that situation: 
(IR4) p lacks disposition to undergo proc1 realized in situation s 
& proc1 negatively_regulates proc2 
& proc2 has_participant p →  
In situation s, p participates_in proc2  
(D3) In the presence of methicillin, PBP2a participates_in  
synthesis_of_peptidoglycan.  
This lack of a disposition (i.e., the affinity to 
methicillin) has a categorical basis in the fact that 
methicillin binds to PBPs and prevents them from 
carrying out their function. However, PBP2a lacks 
this affinity, so the presence of methicillin does not

prevent the essential sub-processes of cell-wall 
construction in MRSa.  
If an organism has a continuant as a part and that part 
participates in a process in some situation, then the 
process unfolds in the organism in that situation. 
Finally, if a process unfolds in an organism in some 
situation and the process results in the development 
of a continuant which (canonically) is a part of the 
organism, then the organism has the continuant as a 
part in that situation. 
(IR5) In situation s, p1 participates_in proc & p1 located_in p2 
& o has_part p2 → proc unfolds_in o in situation s. 
(D4) synthesis_of_peptidoglycan unfolds_in MRSa in the 
presence of methicillin. 
(IR6) In situation s, proc unfolds_in o & 
Canonically, proc results_in_development_of p → 
p part_of o in situation s 
(D5) Bacterial_cell_wall part_of MRSa in the presence of 
methicillin. 
The canonical cell wall is a rigid configuration of 
peptidoglycan. From the perspective of MRSa, the 
canonical cell wall is a healthy one. The assertion 
(D5) captures the active, and thus positive, 
microphysical side of the resistance coin. 
However the chain of reasoning here presents a 
puzzle. What does the lack of a disposition in (IR4) 
amount to? Consider the following pair: 
(A) Continuant C lacks disposition D to undergo process P 
in situation S 
(B) Continuant C undergoes P in a situation of type S.  
Both (A) and (B) can be true at the same time. In fact 
the conjunction of (A) and (B) implies that (B) 
happens for a non-dispositional reason (i.e., (B) is 
not, in the corresponding case, a manifestation of the 
disposition D). Even if John lacks the disposition to 
feel hungry when in the presence of sushi, he may 
still feel hungry in such a situation because he has 
been fasting for three days. We need a way to say that 
PBP2a necessarily lacks affinity to methicillin in 
order to permit the relevant cell-wall formation. 
Mereological Issues 
If we take resistance to be a specifically dependant 
continuant that inheres in an independent continuant, 
then we must still answer some mereological 
questions: Is the resistance of PBP2a (i.e., of a part) 
identical to the resistance of the cell (i.e., of the 
including whole)? Furthermore, is cell resistance 
identical to the resistance of a portion of tissue in 
which the cell resides or the containing host organism 
or, for that matter, of the containing population? The 
ontology of resistance must address which scales of 
biological reality resistant continuants occupy, and 
the identity of resistance across scales. 
Another issue that should be addressed at different 
scales of biological reality is the way in which facts 
at each scale are used to explain the phenomenon of 
resistance. At the genetic scale, MRSa having mecA 
and MSSa lacking mecA are explanatory. At the 
cellular level (D5) is explanatory. 
Conclusion 
We have seen that resistance is an important multi-
scale and multi-domain phenomenon, often with 
a one-to-many relationship between a resistant 
organism and the underlying mechanisms of 
resistance. Several desiderata for an ontological 
representation were found lacking in existing 
ontologies. 
Our 
preliminary 
formalization 
of 
resistance honors both a positivity design principle 
and a principle of non-proliferation of relations, both 
of which are sound principles for the design of 
effective ontologies. Some puzzles remain (e.g., an 
account for the lack of a disposition), but further 
study of resistance will have great benefits for 
biomedical ontologies.

Providing a Realist Perspective on the eyeGENE Database System 
Werner Ceusters 
New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics & Life Sciences, Buffalo, NY, USA 
Abstract 
One of the achievements of the eyeGENE Network is 
a repository of DNA samples of patients with 
inherited eye diseases and an associated database 
that tracks key elements of phenotype and genotype 
information for each patient. Although its database 
structure serves its direct research needs, eyeGENE 
has set a goal of enhancing this structure to become 
increasingly well integrated with medical information 
standards over time. This goal should be achieved by 
ensuring 
semantic 
interoperability 
with 
other 
information systems but without adopting the 
incoherencies and inconsistencies found in available 
biomedical standards. Therefore, eyeGENE’s current 
pragmatic perspective with focus on data and 
information, rather than what the information is 
about, should shift to a realism-based perspective 
that includes also the portion of reality described, 
and the competing opinions that clinicians may hold 
about it. An analysis of eyeGENE’s database 
structure and user interfaces suggests that such a 
transition is possible indeed. 
Introduction 
The eyeGENE database is a repository of genotype 
and phenotype information of patients with inherited 
eye 
diseases 
collected 
through 
the 
National 
Ophthalmic 
Disease 
Genotyping 
Network, 
an 
initiative launched by the National Eye Institute in 
2006.1 The database design used the innovate 
approach of defining the structure of phenotype 
information by means of metadata, so that new 
diagnoses and questions concerning clinical findings 
could be added or modified by the eyeGENE 
administrator at any time. The goal was to allow 
collection of a large number of samples with a 
minimal data entry burden to the clinician and 
genetics testing labs, and to provide an easy overview 
of key data for a researcher who may wish to study 
details of an attached eye image or otherwise study 
the patient’s data in more depth. 
To avoid this system becoming yet another 
information silo, eyeGENE set a further goal of 
integrating the eyeGENE data with applicable 
medical information standards over time. It can be 
expected that adopting currently available and 
emerging medical information standards will provide 
an additional layer of benefits in more easily 
collecting, sharing and analyzing data in the future. 
As a first step, an extensive study was performed 
on existing and emerging standards relevant to 
clinical research data, including the identification of 
gaps and overlaps.2 This study revealed that this goal 
is confounded by  deficiencies in many standards 
pertinent to clinical data registration, which suffer 
from reductionist views on reality which are 
constrained by what can be seen through the lenses of 
either information systems3 or terminologies and 
ontologies that adhere to what is called ‘concept 
representation’.4 Without appropriate remediation, 
semantic interoperability between systems adhering 
to such standards will be on a less than fully logically 
sound foundation and will suffer limitations over 
time. 
Objectives 
As witnessed by the success of the OBO-Foundry a 
growing number of scholars adheres to a realist view 
on reality and to an implementation along these lines 
both in ontologies5 and information systems.6 The 
goal of the study reported on here was (1) to 
understand the type of view embedded in the 
eyeGENE database and (2) in case this view would 
differ from the realist one, to propose a migration 
path towards the latter. 
Material and Methods 
We studied the available documentation about 
eyeGENE’s core medical information, including parts 
of its information model and user interfaces. We 
looked at some of the clinical questions (and 
corresponding possible-answer sets) that are asked to 
eyeGENE users when they enter data in the system, 
as well as to system generated reports about lab 
procedures performed on genes. We did not have 
access to a data-dictionary with data-definitions and 
corresponding business rules. 
We checked in the first place for design choices in 
the system that would lead the information to be 
collected not to match with the corresponding 
structure of reality, the latter under the realist view 
consisting of: 
1. first-order reality, which includes entities such 
as specific patients, their relatives, the disorders 
they are suffering from, the lab tests that have 
been conducted, and so forth; 
2.  second-order reality, including, for instance, 
interpretations and opinions on the side of 
clinicians, including hypotheses and diagnoses;

thus being about entities in first-order reality, 
although not accessible to third parties without 
additional third-order references; 
3. third-order  reality, which is composed of 
information about first- or second-order reality, 
examples being entries in information systems 
such as the eyeGENE database. 
We also checked for structural and functional issues 
in eyeGENE that in absence of sufficient background 
information for disambiguation would lead to 
difficulties in interpreting data once entered. 
Results and Discussion 
We found that to meet its goal of future integration 
with high quality medical information systems over 
time, the pragmatic design approach initially 
followed by the eyeGENE developers should be 
transformed to remove current limitations of (1) 
conflating the three levels of reality as described 
above, and (2) not representing faithfully the relevant 
portions of reality at each level. 
An example of a non-faithful representation of 
first-order reality is eyeGENE’s treatment of the 
patient’s demographic information: the user interface 
lists a number of data entry fields, amongst which the 
postal code, as ‘required’. A motivation for including 
‘required fields’ in data entry forms is to have data as 
complete as possible.  Sometimes, however, as is the 
case here, these constraints violate what is the case in 
reality: many countries do not use postal codes at all. 
If eyeGENE’s realm is not limited to patients living 
in the US, such constraints pose a problem as they 
force the user to enter fake data, or, when the latter is 
against the user’s principles, prevent him from 
entering data at all. A strategy often applied is to 
allow for various sorts of null-values, but that 
changes the semantics of the data field drastically: it 
would then not always contain strings that denote 
postal codes, but strings that denote, for example, that 
there are no postal codes in the corresponding 
country, or that the postal code is not known by the 
user. Confusions of this sort are, for example, 
abundantly present in HL7.3 
Another example of a required field in eyeGENE 
is ‘gender’ with the two possible values ‘female’ and 
‘male’. This might seem to be consistent with first-
order reality as each human being can be expected to 
be either ‘male’ or ‘female’. However, for each of the 
three possible interpretations of what the word 
‘gender’ here might stand for, matters are not that 
obvious. Phenotypic gender is not either male or 
female in hermaphrodites, genotypic gender comes in 
many more flavors, while, finally, administrative 
gender, depending on the community in which it is 
defined, is based not only on scientific grounds but 
also on political, ethical, and even religious 
considerations, thereby giving rise to oddities to the 
effect that the different treatments of the right of 
gender self-identification makes it possible that the 
same person has a different administrative gender in 
Australia and in the US.7 
The eyeGene database contains many examples 
not of unfaithful representation of reality but rather of 
undocumented reductionism. It allows, for instance, 
the eye fundus to be described as being normal or 
exhibiting any combination of four types of anomalies. 
By ‘undocumented’, we mean that it is left unspecified 
whether these four types are the only possible types in 
reality, or whether there are many more possibilities of 
a sort which are not relevant for the purposes for which 
eyeGENE has been designed, and therefore are not 
offered as additional alternatives. 
An example of a conflation of first-order and 
second-order reality is in the registration of diagnoses. 
Clinicians are requested to provide the date of 
examination and then to select one or more types of 
diagnoses out of a list of 21. Based on that 
information and with the goal to collect further data 
about signs and symptoms, clinical data entry forms 
specific for each type of diagnosis are generated. 
These forms are composed out of building blocks 
some of which, for example to provide details about 
the patient’s ‘best corrected visual acuity’, can appear 
in forms related to more than one diagnosis. Once 
data are provided in the context of one diagnosis, the 
same data re-appear in the form corresponding to 
another diagnosis. This setup, although being very 
pragmatic – it frees the clinician from entering the 
same data more than once – leads to ambiguities from 
an ontological perspective. 
One ambiguity arises from the mere fact of 
entering 
diagnoses 
without 
identifying 
the 
corresponding disorder about which that diagnosis is 
a diagnosis: disorders are first-order entities on the 
side of the patient while diagnoses are second-order 
entities on the side of, for instance, the clinician.8 
Disorders and diagnoses live totally different lives: 
patients may have a disorder without any diagnosis 
being made; clinicians may come to one diagnosis 
while the patient may have either two or more 
disorders or no disorder at all; distinct clinicians may 
bring forward different diagnoses for the one disorder 
the patient has; a clinician may change his diagnosis 
over time, while the disorder does not change at all, 
and so forth. The problem becomes obvious when 
more than one clinical examination form is entered: 
in absence of identifiers for the disorder, it is not 
possible to deduce formally in case a diagnosis 
entered on an earlier form is different from the 
diagnosis on a later form whether the difference is 
because the earlier diagnosis is revised, whether there 
is a second disorder involved, or, if distinct clinicians

entered the forms whether there is disagreement 
about the correct diagnosis. 
Another ambiguity, when multiple diagnoses are 
specified, is to what the individual clinical signs 
relate. Although clinical signs provide evidence in 
favor or against certain diagnoses, a particular 
clinical sign in some patient is not related to any 
diagnoses entertained for that patient, but rather to at 
least one disorder from which that patient suffers. 
Recommendations 
It is no surprise that the information model of the 
eyeGENE database exhibits the sorts of mismatches 
with reality just described: to our best knowledge, all 
information systems designed according to the state 
of the art in information modeling suffer from these 
incoherencies because of at least two misconceptions. 
One is the erroneous assumption of inherent 
classification adhered to in many database design 
circles according to which entities can be referred to 
only as instances of pre-specified classes.9 Under the 
realist view, in contrast, the position is defended that 
in information systems entities should exclusively be 
referred to by means of globally unique and singular 
identifiers.6 These identifiers can then to be used in 
descriptions of various sorts indicating, for instance, 
what universals are instantiated by the entity referred 
to, what terms from a terminology or concept-based 
ontology apply to it, or how the entity relates to other 
entities.  
The other misconception is the tyranny of the use 
case, what leads some to argue that ‘if most people 
wrongly believe that crocodiles are a kind of mammal, 
then most people would find it easier to locate 
information about crocodiles if it were located in a 
mammals grouping, rather than where it factually 
belonged’.10 
Of course, the incoherencies of the information 
model and business rules as compared to what is the 
case in reality are not relevant to the original goals 
for which eyeGENE has been designed. But they do 
become a problem when the data have to be pooled 
with data coming from other information systems that 
describe partially or in total the same domain from a 
different perspective and are collected for another 
purpose. In that case, the second system, if designed 
following prevailing approaches, will also contain 
incoherencies with respect to reality, but in different 
ways than eyeGENE. A comparative analysis of the 
underlying information models may reveal areas 
where they are in agreement and other places where 
they cannot both be correct. But in absence of an 
external benchmark, there is no means to assess 
which one is right, not even when both models are in 
agreement because they both might have it wrong in 
the same way. 
We argue that reality should function as that 
benchmark, and that realism-based ontology provides 
the means to reach that goal in similar ways as it is 
increasingly and successfully used for quality assurance 
in biomedical terminologies and ontologies.5 The 
reason is that no portion of reality depends on the 
information used to describe it or on the purposes for 
which such information is collected. This is not to say 
that such information does not contribute to the 
evolution of reality at all. On the contrary, as soon as 
it is generated, that information is part of reality itself 
(level 3), and so is the system used to manage it. 
Therefore any attempt to make such system, in our 
case the eyeGENE database system, coherent with 
respect to reality, should acknowledge the priorities 
and objectives that have been taken into account at 
design time. If, for instance, through realism-based 
analysis one discovers a reductionist approach (e.g. 
the eye fundus description described earlier), it would 
be a bad idea to bother the users of the eyeGENE 
database with a more complex interface that does not 
bring them advantage in any way, even if it would 
help secondary users of the data. 
The right way forward, so we argue, is by mapping 
the information model of eyeGENE to a domain model 
that itself is not reductionist in nature. Reductionist 
models are typically created when UML is used as 
this language forces reality to be viewed through the 
eyes of an information system, using a (partially 
graphic) vocabulary which is inadequate to describe 
reality faithfully. The HL7 RIM is the most dramatic 
example, dramatic because its acceptance as ISO 
standard gives it an unjustified aura of excellence.11 
Note that we see no harm in using an existing 
information model to scope the corresponding 
domain model. The procedure, in the context of 
eyeGENE, would be to study each of its tables, data 
fields and associated allowed values, as well as any 
hard- or soft-coded business rules that restrict data-
input, with the following goals: (1) to assess what 
(type of) entity in reality would be denoted by any 
data instance, (2) to represent how these entities in 
reality relate to each other as well as to other 
ontologically relevant entities that are not explicitly 
addressed in the information model, this being the 
domain model proper, and (3) to describe formally 
how the information model has to be interpreted in 
terms of the domain model. The latter can then be 
used to inform third party systems with which the 
eyeGENE database system would exchange data 
about the implicit restrictions in eyeGENE. It can 
also be used to identify issues that must be resolved 
in further releases. 
As an example, eyeGENE’s information model 
relates a PatientDiagnosis to (1) a ClinicalEncounter 
which itself is related to a Patient and a 
69

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PhysicianPerson and (2) a Diagnosis. The eyeGENE 
database system limits the latter to 21 types, however, 
upon closer inspection, not to types of diagnoses, but 
to types of diseases. The domain model would tell us 
that there are of course many more types of diseases. 
The interpretation model would then contain 
statements clarifying this distinction. With respect to 
(1), the interpretation model could clarify, for 
instance, whether the date of the ClinicalEncounter is 
the date that the diagnosis was made, and that this by 
itself would not allow inferences to be made about 
when the disease started. To some extent, eyeGENE 
users can clarify such issues in free text, but this 
cannot be used for automated processing.  
No new formalism is required to achieve such 
integration. The same sort of bridging axioms that are 
commonly written to map or merge concept-based 
ontologies12, can be applied to explain eyeGENE’s 
information model in terms of the domain model. 
Conclusion 
The eyeGENE database system is successfully in use 
since July 2006 and processes 35 samples per month. 
It is foreseen that this number will grow to 100 by 
end 2009. To most optimally fulfill its ambitious goal 
of integration with high quality medical information 
systems in future developments, the eyeGENE 
database system can become a model of fulfilling a 
stated objective in the NIH roadmap to ‘require new 
ways to organize how clinical research information is 
recorded, new standards for clinical research 
protocols, modern information technology’. One 
expectation, in the context of the patient profile, is 
that at some future time relevant phenotypic data can 
be automatically extracted from an electronic medical 
record using a standard in widespread use. At that 
point, a larger set of base patient data in more specific 
detail would be practical to collect. Realism-based 
ontology combined with adequate identification and 
reference of entities at each level of reality is one new 
way that can be explored to turn these data into 
knowledge.

Abstract 
The Gene Ontology is being normalized and 
extended to include computable logical definitions. 
These definitions are partitioned into mutually 
exclusive 
cross-product 
sets, 
many 
of 
which 
referenc=e other OBO Foundry ontologies. The 
results can be used to reason over the ontology, and 
to make cross-ontology queries. 
Introduction 
The Gene Ontology (GO)1 was conceived of as a 
means of providing structured annotations for genes 
and gene products, in terms of molecular function 
(MF), 
biological 
process 
(BP) 
and 
cellular 
component (CC). The current version of the GO has 
nearly 27,000 terms and 47,000 relationships. As the 
GO evolves, the relational graph becomes more 
tangled, which poses a problem for ontology 
maintenance, correctness and visualization. It has 
long been recognized that a normalized approach to 
ontology 
development 
helps 
with 
re-use, 
maintainability and evolution2,3,4. The OBO Foundry5 
was initiated in part to provide a means of 
normalizing the GO, such that for example the GO 
definition of “oocyte differentiation” could reference 
the term “oocyte” in the OBO Cell ontology (CL), 
and an automated reasoner tool could be used to 
classify this as a kind of “germ cell differentiation”, 
based on the CL classification. This is also an 
example of a ‘re-use’ pattern, common in software 
engineering. 
Almost all of the terms in the GO have textual 
definitions, crafted for the human users of the GO. 
When these textual definitions are rendered in a 
computable 
from, 
we 
can 
leverage 
reasoner 
technology to automate the more tedious and error-
prone aspects of ontology maintenance. We can also 
use these computable definitions to make cross-
ontology queries and better visualize the ontology. 
Logical Definitions and Cross Products 
differentia, a collection of characteristics that serve to 
discriminate instances of X from other instances of G. 
The differentiae are specified as relationships to other 
terms, using relations from the Relations Ontology6. 
In OBO Format (the native means of representing the 
GO) these are specified using intersection_of 
tags, which list the necessary and sufficient 
conditions for a term. For example: 
[Term]  
id: GO:0032543  
name: mitochondrial translation  
intersection_of: GO:0006412 ! translation  
intersection_of: occurs_in GO:0005739 !  
mitochondrion  
In OWL Manchester Syntax, this is written as an 
equivalence axiom between the class mitochondrial 
translation and the description translation and 
occurs_in some mitochondrion. 
In the example above, the logical definition for the 
process references a GO cellular component term. 
Often we will want to reference other OBO 
ontologies, 
and 
this 
introduces 
multiple 
dependencies. We therefore partition the full set of 
logical definitions for GO into cross-product 
mapping. A cross-product of two ontologies A x B is 
the set of biologically meaningful terms that can be 
constructed by extending A using terms from B as 
differentia. The GO term in the example above would 
be mapped to a definition in the BP x CC cross 
product. 
Each cross-product mapping is maintained as an 
individual resource, independent of the others (see 
Table 1). Currently they are optional add-ons to the 
GO. We distinguish between intra-GO cross products 
and inter-GO cross products, the latter consisting of 
logical definitions that reference an OBO ontology 
not under the management of the Gene Ontology 
Consortium. 
A subset of the intra-GO cross products are the self-
cross products: terms that can be defined solely by 
using terms in the same ontology. 
We provide computable logical definitions for terms 
Biological processes 
using genus-differentia constructs, of the form “an X 
The BP x CC cross-product set includes definitions
is a G that D”. Here X is the term we are defining, G 
for biological process terms that have cellular 
is the genus (more general term), and D is the

component terms as differentia. Sometimes we need 
to specify the subcellular location in which a process 
occurs, in which case we use an occurs_in relation. 
Sometimes we are describing the output of a process, 
such as when a cellular component is assembled or 
disassembled. The GO also has a rich set of 
subcellular transport terms, in which case the logical 
definition needs to be precise about the origin, 
destination and route of the transported entity. 
Many BP terms can be defined using a BP term in the 
differentia. For example, the different phases of the 
cell cycle can be subtyped according to whether they 
are part of mitosis or meiosis. These definitions are 
grouped into the BP x BP set. 
GO includes 3 broad categories of regulatory 
processes – regulation of molecular function, 
regulation of biological process, and regulation of 
biological quality – these comprise 3 distinct cross-
product sets. The first two are intra-GO; the latter 
references terms from the PATO ontology of 
biological qualities7, together with anatomical 
ontologies. 
The cross products make use of 3 new relations 
introduced into GO – regulates, negatively_regulates 
and positively_regulates. 
We have created a separate cross-product set for the 
more complex multi-organism interaction regulation 
terms. The logical definitions we provide here are 
necessarily a simplification, as we must go beyond 
the current expressive capabilities of OBO or OWL 
in order to represent inter-organism interactions. 
Anatomy 
GO has many terms describing development at the 
cellular and gross anatomical level. There are also 
non-development terms that nevertheless reference 
types of anatomical entity – for example, “muscle 
contraction”. 
We use the species-neutral OBO Cell ontology (CL)8 
for defining terms such as “oocyte differentiation” in 
the BP x CL set. Gross anatomy proves more of a 
challenge because the main OBO gross anatomy 
ontologies are specific to a species or taxon. We 
therefore extracted the implicit anatomical ontology 
embedded in the GO and used this together with 
alignments to existing anatomy ontologies to seed a 
multi-species anatomy ontology called Uberon, 
which is used in the definition of terms such as 
“muscle contraction”. These definitions are part of 
the BP x Uberon set. Uberon covers only animals; 
plant development terms are in BP x PO (plant 
anatomy ontology). There are also individual species-
species extensions such as BP x Fly_anatomy. 
Molecules and Proteins 
Molecular and chemical entities are represented in 
the CHEBI ontology9, with proteins represented in 
PRO10. We use these in 3 cross-product sets, 
{BP,MF} x CHEBI11 and BP x PRO. The Protein 
Ontology is still relatively new, so this last set is 
currently relatively small. We also intend to work 
with the PRO curators to make a CC x PRO set. 
Cellular Components 
Many of the terms in CC can be assigned logical 
definitions based on parthood relations to other 
components – for example, “nuclear chromosome” is 
a chromosome that is part_of a nucleus. For other 
definitions in CC x CC, we introduce additional 
spatial relations, such as surrounds and surrounded by. 
The GO CC ontology has many terms representing 
complexes, some of which are defined by their 
constituent parts, others by function. The latter have 
logical definitions in the CC x MF cross-product.  
Some cell component terms are differentiated by the 
cell type of which they are a part – for example, a 
sarcoplasm is a cytoplasm that is part_of a muscle 
cell. We map GO terms such as sarcoplasm to the BP 
x CL set, most of which use the part_of relation. For 
others, such as neuromuscular junction we use 
adjacency relations. 
Reasoning 
The current set of logical definitions can be used by a 
variety of different reasoners. We use the OBO-Edit12 
reasoner, because it is integrated within the normal 
editing environment for the GO, and provides 
incremental reasoning support. 
We have not found any reasoner that is capable of 
reasoning over the union of the GO plus all cross-
product sets plus all referenced ontologies. However, 
we are able to reason over individual cross-product 
sets and their referenced ontologies individually. 
We 
use 
reasoning 
primarily 
for 
ontology 
maintenance, to compute and check the subsumption 
hierarchy. The GO regulation hierarchy in particular 
has benefited from this work, with over 2000 missing 
links added to GO, which could potentially improve 
the results of term enrichment analyses. We use the 
reasoner in what we call ‘repair mode’ – we invoke 
the reasoner to spot mistakes and fill in missing links 
in the ontology, always asserting links that can be 
automatically computed. This ensures that editors can 
edit the ontology without invoking the reasoner over 
the union of all logical definitions. This stands in 
contrast to how the reasoner is used in SO and the 
Fly anatomy ontology. We also use the reasoner to 
make inferences about the source ontologies13.

We are still exploring uses of the cross-product sets 
beyond ontology construction and maintenance. This 
includes improved visualization, enhancing term 
enrichment analyses, annotation inferences and using 
the CHEBI cross-products to harmonize pathway 
database representations and GO metabolic processes. 
Post-Composition 
The GO does not pre-compose terms for all 
biologically meaningful compositions of terms, as 
this would lead to a large, unwieldy ontology. The 
guiding principle is to generate compositional terms 
where the differentia is important to the biology. We 
are simultaneously exploring an approach whereby 
annotators can extend GO terms on-the-fly, i.e. 
selecting compositions from the cross-product at 
annotation time. For example, an annotator can select 
the GO term ‘mitochondrial membrane’ for a cellular 
component annotation and extend this using a 
differentia ‘part_of Purkinje cell’, with the differentia 
term coming from CL. This is logically equivalent to 
annotating to a term ‘mitochondrial membrane of 
Purkinje cell’, but avoids bloating the ontology with 
the full set of biologically instantiable terms in the 
CC x CL cross-product.

Conclusions 
The extended collection of cross-product resources 
described here represents a significant advance in the 
evolution of the GO and its integration with other 
OBO ontologies. The use of these logical definitions, 
in conjunction with a reasoner has substantially 
increased the quality of the GO and eased the more 
prosaic aspects of ontology maintenance. We are still 
exploring application beyond the ontology itself. 
This work also highlights the importance and 
necessity of the OBO Foundry effort, particularly 
with respect to efforts to create single orthogonal 
well-partitioned ontologies each representing a 
distinct domain of biology.  
Methods and Availability 
In contrast to some ontology development efforts, in 
which computable definitions are assigned when 
terms 
are 
created, 
we 
have 
been 
working 
retrospectively, constructing logical descriptions for 
pre-existing terms. To help us with this task we use 
Obol14, which heuristically generates proposed 
logical definitions based using ontology-specific 
grammars. Ontology editors then vet the definitions, 
often substantially.

Abstract 
We outline the structure of an automated process to 
both align multiple bio-ontologies in terms of their 
genomic co-annotations, and then to measure the 
structural quality of that alignment. We illustrate 
the method with a genomic analysis of 70 genes 
implicated in lung disease against the Gene Ontology. 
Introduction 
Ontologies are commonly aligned based on similar 
annotations 3, 7, requiring validation of the quality of 
the induced alignment. In this short paper we make 
describe an approach to automated annotation-based 
bio-ontology alignment combined with subsequent 
measurement of the quality of those alignments. We 
do so using an example from lung disease genomics. 
We begin with a list of 70 genes implicated in 
lung diseases. These are annotated to the Biological 
Process (BP) and Molecular Function (MF) branches 
of the Gene Ontology (GO 4). The Cross Ontology 
Analytics tool (XOA, http://xoa.pnl.gov,10, 12) is then 
used to generate proximities between pairs of nodes in 
the BP and MF branches. The XOA scoring allows 
generation of putative alignments between BP and 
MF nodes, and then Joslyn et al.’s order-theoretical 
approach6 is used to measure the structural quality of 
the generated alignments. 
Lung Disease Genomics 
The impact of genomics to study classes of diseases 
has yet to be fully realized. Research about lung 
diseases, focused on the cancers and other pathologies 
of specific tissue types, will benefit from systems 
analysis of cellular pathways and processes implicated 
in the presentation of disease states 9 . 
Genomic 
and proteomic analysis via ontological representations 
of gene product location and function has enabled 
the construction of predictive functional networks 
awaiting experimental validation5 . 
We identified a set of 70 genes through our 
work in lung development and disease to evaluate 
the contribution of ontological alignments to fur­
ther refined experimental hypotheses. 
We iden­
tified these 70 genes through expression analysis 
of mouse lung samples representing different de­
velopmental stages. 
The gene list is available at 
ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/ 
curatorwork/ICBO09/lung dev genes.txt. This de­
fined set was chosen to be representative of molecular 
systems implicated in lung development and function. 
The 
2/26/09 
version 
of 
mouse 
annotations 
(ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/pub/reports/ 
gene association.mgi) yields 1937 lines of GO 
annotations, including 424 distinct BP annotations, of 
which 388 were experimental annotations from mouse 
systems. 
There were 80 distinct MF annotations, 
40 with experimental support. 
Overall, there are 
62 genes with experimental BP annotations and 50 
genes with experimental MF annotations. 48 genes, 
included in the results of the previous sentence, had 
both MF and BP experimental annotations. 
Alignment Generation 
XOA automatically generates links between BP and 
MF nodes based on their common annotations. In­
formation theoretical approaches8 are effective within 
one hierarchy. But because they require that similarity 
between two GO codes be computed in terms of 
the informational content of the most immediately 
dominating parent GO code, they cannot link GO 
codes across distinct gene subontologies. The vector 
space model approach 
obviates this limitation by 
computing the similarity between two GO codes as 
the cosine of vectors that encode the gene annotation 
associated with the two GO codes1 . XOA combines 
these two approaches by turning relational links across 
GO codes into hierarchical links12 . 
We model semantic hierarchies as finite, bounded, 
partially ordered sets (posets) P = hP, ≤i 2 , with 
nodes a ∈ P as ontology concepts related by is-a 
links through ≤. The XOA similarity between the 
GO node a ∈P and the GO node a0 ∈P 0 is then 
XOA(a, a 0) := max 
max (sim(a, b) cos(a 0, b)), 
b∈P 
max (sim(a 0, b0) cos(a, b0))
, 
b0∈P 0 
where cos(a, a0) denotes the cosine measure11 between 
75

GO nodes a ∈P, a0 ∈P 0 in the GO node × gene 
annotation matrix, and sim(a, b) denotes Resnik’s 
information theoretical similarity measure 8 between 
GO nodes a, b ∈P. An XOA analysis of the GO 
nodes annotated to our 70 test genes reveals 1970 
BP-MF pairs ~l := ha, a0i which are significant, with 
p ≤ 5%. Each such pair of anchors is a potential 
link between BP and MF. 
An ontology alignment is a mapping f: P →P0 
taking anchors a ∈P in a semantic hierarchy P = 
hP, ≤i to those a0 ∈P 0 in another P0 = hP 0 , ≤0i. But 
a BP node a ∈P which has a high XOA score with an 
MF node a0 ∈P 0 is also likely to have a high XOA 
score with other MF nodes b0 ∈P 0 . The complete 
set of 1970 links ~l yields a many-to-many alignment 
relation F ⊆P × P 0 . We need an alignment function 
f: P →P0 with all left anchors appearing only once, 
so we sort the links by XOA to select the highest-
scoring links ha, a0i where a or a0 appears. These 36 
one-to-one links are shown in Table 1. 
Alignment Evaluation 
We measure the structural properties of f shown 
in Table 1 (see 6 for more information). But our 
primary criterion is that f should not distort the metric 
relations of concepts, taking nodes that are close 
together and making them farther apart, or vice versa. 
For two ontology nodes a, b ∈P, their lower distance 
is dl(a, b) :=  | ↓a| + | ↓b| −2 max | ↓c|, where 
c∈a∧b 
↓x = {y ≤x} is the set of all descendants of x, and 
a ∧b is the set of greatest lower bounds (glbs) below 
a and b. If  a and b lack a glb, we assume a bottom 
node 0 ∈P which is below all the leaves. The dual 
upper distance du(a, b) =  | ↑a|+| ↑b|−2 max | ↑c|
c∈a∨b 
is also available, where ↑x = {y ≥x} is the set of all 
ancestors of x, and a∨b is the set of least upper bounds 
(least common subsumers). 
Upper distance may 
appear more natural, but is not generally preferable for 
technical reasons related to the desire for e.g. siblings 
deep in the hierarchy to be closer together than siblings 
high in the hierarchy. While in general it may be 
preferable to use both in combination, in this paper 
we use lower distance only. 
We can measure the change in distance between a, b ∈ 
P induced by f as the distance discrepancy 
¯ 
δ(a, b) :=  |d¯ l(a, b) −dl(f(a), f(b))|, 
dl(a,b)
where d¯ l(a, b) :=  
∈[0, 1] is the normalized 
diamd(P) 
lower distance between a and b in P given the diam­
eter diamd(P) := max d(a, b). In this case, we have 
a,b∈P 
diam(BP) = 14659, diam(MF)= 8260. Finally, we can 
measure the entire amount of distance discrepancy at 
a node a ∈P compared to all the other anchors b ∈P 
by summing 
δf (a) :=  
X
δ(a, b) =  
X
|d¯ l(a, b)−d¯ l(f(a), f(b))|. 
b∈P
b∈P 
Note that we use δf to indicate that this is an overall 
discrepancy of a with respect to the entire alignment 
f. Also note that since f is one-to-one, it is invertible, 
so ∀a ∈P, δf (a) =  δf (f(a)) and ∀a0 ∈P 0, δf (a0) =  
δf (f−1(a0)). Thus we can denote δf (~l) =  δf (a) for 
~l = ha, f(a)i, which is also shown in Table 1. 
Discussion and Further Work 
Fig. 1 shows an abstract representation of a portion 
of the GO involving the top four scoring XOA links 
and the top two δf links. In general, we are pleased 
with the quality of the links provided by the XOA 
scores coupled with the one-to-one link filtering. It 
is a good sign that the nodes that did come up as 
significant are ones that make sense in the light of the 
gene list context (development). With one exception, 
the top 6 to 8 linked nodes represent molecules and 
processes associated with cell motility and with known 
regulators of cellular differentiation, such as the 
hedgehog signaling pathway. The frequency of nodes 
associated with motility underscore the importance of 
cellular migration during differentiation. 
The distribution of XOA vs. δf is shown in Fig. 2. It 
can be seen that the XOA scoring method produces 
a strong alignment, with links having generally low 
δf scores. There are two exceptions which deserve 
further study to improve the analysis: 
BP:GO:0007154 cell communication 
MF:GO:0000062 acyl-CoA binding 
BP:GO:0000187 activation of MAPK activity 
MF:GO:0004672 protein kinase activity 
To interpret this, for a given one-to-one link ~l = 
ha, f(a)i between a BP node a and MF node f(a), the 
XOA score measures the co-annotation of a and f(a), 
while the δf score meaures the distance of ~l from all 
the other links in virtue of f, that is, the distance of a 
from all other BP anchors b, and dually the distance 
of f(a) from all other MF anchors f(b). 
The lower distance dl(a, b) involves the numbers 
of nodes below a, b, and both of them. 
Thus 
from Fig. 1 we can see that both “BP:GO:0007154 
cell communication” and “MF:GO:0004672 protein 
kinase activity” have unusually many nodes below 
them (341 and 105 respectively). This makes them 
effectively “far away” from the other nodes in BP 
and MF, while their corresponding anchor in the other

ontology is close to its comrades. This is clear in 
Fig. 1, and thus our method identifies these links 
which are clearly significant by XOA, but also distant 
from the other links. 
Figure 2: XOA(a, f(a)) vs. δf (a). 
δf provides a measure only about ontology structure, 
and there may be reasons in ontology design or 
annotation for high δf to be preferable, e.g. if it 
were important that annotations be made high in the 
structure in some cases. The results would also be 
different if there were common nodes below pairs 
of anchors, which is entirely possible in the GO 
DAG structure with multiple inheritance, especially 
if the anchors were higher. Finally, note that the 
number of descendants is correlated both with level 
in the GO, and the information content (probability) 
of a node used in semantic similarity calculation. 
These correlations need to be explored in future work. 
Further work for a full paper includes: 
• There are potential difficulties of mixing exper­
imental and inferential annotations, as reported 
here, these should be analyzed separately. 
• The analytical pipeline needs to be tested for 
sensitivity at multiple points, especially the fil­
tering to one-to-one links: 
it is likely that 
there are links which re-use an anchor which 
have only a slightly different XOA score, but 
would produce a preferable mapping according 
to δf . Additionally, the alignment measurement 
method6 originally was designed to work on 
many-to-many alignment relations F ⊆ P × P 0 , 
so extensions in this direction may be desirable. 
• We have begun analysis on the distribution of δf 
as a function of p-value cutoff. 
• Other aspects of the alignment measurement 
methodology6 need to be incorporated, including: 
reconciling the use of upper distance together 
with lower distance; and the additional use of an 
order discrepancy measure, which rather than 
being sensitive to the distances between links, 
measures order violations (e.g. mapping siblings 
to parent-child links) implied by an alignment.

Abstract 
While OWL, the Web Ontology Language, is often 
regarded as the preferred language for Knowledge 
Representation in the world of the Semantic Web, the 
potential of direct representation in RDF, the 
Resource Description Framework, is underestimated. 
Here we show how ontologies adequately represented 
in RDF could be semantically enriched with 
SPARUL. To deal with the semantics of relations we 
created Metarel, a meta-ontology for relations. The 
utility of the approach is demonstrated by an 
application on Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) 
RDF 
graphs 
in 
the 
RDF 
Knowledge 
Base 
BioGateway. We show that Metarel can facilitate 
inferencing in BioGateway, which allows for queries 
that are otherwise not possible. Metarel is available 
on http://www.metarel.org. 
Introduction 
Ontologies have become one of the cornerstones of 
Knowledge Management (KM) in the Life Sciences.1 
They are increasingly used for annotating and 
integrating biomedical data, including genomic data, 
patient data, disease data, molecular data and more. 
For ontologies to fulfill their intended role, it is 
mandatory that both the ontologies and the data are 
modeled with the use of technologies that enable 
efficient integration and querying. In addition, these 
technologies should allow inferencing of new 
knowledge, one of the great promises of Knowledge 
Representation (KR). 
The Semantic Web provides such technologies, the 
most important ones being the Resource Description 
Framework RDF and the Web Ontology Language 
OWL.2,3 The life sciences, in particular the domain of 
systems biology, are expected to be among the early 
adopters of these technologies.4 While a number of 
successful applications of the Semantic Web 
technologies in the life sciences have been reported 
(GenoQuery, LinkHub, Thea-online, BioDash), the 
field is still in its infancy and a number of technical 
hurdles need to be overcome.5-9 For example, while 
OWL 
allows 
semantically 
rich 
knowledge 
representation, querying large knowledge bases 
represented 
in 
OWL 
poses 
a 
tremendous 
computational tractability challenge.10 Here we 
explore how a highly optimized RDF implementation 
can be used to alleviate some of the hurdles while 
still supporting rich inferencing. 
Rendering Class Level Relations in RDF 
The two languages used widely for bio-ontologies, 
OBOF and OWL, differ markedly in the way they 
express 
the 
semantics 
of 
relations 
between 
classes.11,12 OWL expresses such relations by 
defining properties (relations between instances) in a 
property hierarchy. Relations between classes are 
created by adding extra fillers on the properties, 
which allows for number restrictions and grouping 
properties as necessary and sufficient conditions for 
defining classes. These fillers make the links between 
classes indirect in OWL/RDF, the RDF representa­
tion of OWL. OBOF, on the other hand, assumes all 
classes as defined by definition tags and relations are 
never considered as sufficient conditions. This 
approach has allowed to make direct links for 
relations between classes (see Figure 1). 
The modeling with direct links in RDF, illustrated in 
Figure 1A, has a number of advantages over 
OWL/RDF: it is less verbose, it requires less 
computational power for loading and querying, and it 
is more intuitive. Moreover, the number of instances 
documented in biological ontologies is very small 
compared to the number of classes, which makes the 
treatment of relations between classes especially 
important in this domain. The direct links for 
relations between classes in OBOF can be readily 
modelled in RDF by putting them in the central place 
of an RDF triple (the predicate). 
Interestingly, these relations (like is_a, part_of, etc.) 
have their own URIs (Unique Resource Identifiers) 
and they can appear in the first or the last place of a 
triple (resp. subject or object) as well. They can 
connect with any other URIs by using metarelations

Figure 1. OBOF/RDF (1A) relies on direct links between classes. OWL/RDF (1B) uses anonymous classes, as blank nodes, to link classes. 
as predicates. To exploit the opportunities this opens, 
we created Metarel, a meta-ontology for relations that 
can support RO, the Relationship Ontology of the 
OBO Foundry.13,14 With Metarel, OBO ontologies 
can be translated to RDF in a format with direct 
links, without any loss of expressivity. 
Metarel was manually created with OBO-Edit and it 
has an export to RDF, created with ONTO-PERL.15 
We list some of its most important features: 1. It 
allows to create meta-relations between relations; 2. 
It distinguishes ‘all-some’ relations from other types 
of relations; 3. It can indicate unambiguously which 
pairs of relations are each others inverses; 4. It has a 
place in its hierarchy where formally defined instance 
level relations can be attached; 5. It classifies 
reflexive and transitive relations in meta-classes; 6. It 
contains constructs for composites of relations; 7. It 
contains a meta-class for relations that are relevant 
towards inferencing (e.g. exclude anatomically_rela­
ted_to, but not dorsal_to). 
Metarel is used in the RDF knowledge base 
BioGateway.16,17 which has OBO relations. By 
linking all the relations in BioGateway to Metarel we 
obtain BioMetarel, essentially a bioscience specifi­
cation of Metarel. 
Inferencing with OBO Foundry Relations 
To investigate the efficacy of BioMetarel to facilitate 
inferencing in BioGateway we started from the 
semantics of its OBO relations. First of all, we 
emphasize that only relations at the class level are 
defined in RO. Their definitions refer to relations at 
the instance level, but those have neither unique 
identifiers nor definitions on their own. Therefore we 
will only infer new relations at the class level. As 
discussed in [14], the relations in OBOF have an ‘all­
some’ semantics. This means that if e.g. A part_of B, 
then for all the instances a of class A there is some 
instance b of class B for which a is part of b. The 
validity of any inferences from this semantics 
depends on the extent to which annotators have 
applied this rule correctly in producing knowledge 
statements for OBO. We found five sound 
mechanisms to infer new relations with OBO 
semantics: 
1.  A reflexive closure creates a relation link A R A 
for every class A and for every reflexive relation 
R. A query that asks for all the parts of the Golgi 
apparatus, will also return ‘Golgi apparatus’, 
because part_of is reflexive. 
2.  A transitive closure creates a relation link A R C, 
from any class A to any class C, for every 
transitive relation R, if the relation links A R B 
and B R C exist already. E.g. ‘nucleolus part_of 
nuclear lumen’ and ‘nuclear lumen part_of 
nucleus’, creates ‘nucleolus part_of nucleus’. 
3.  The inferencing of relations that have priority 
over the subsumption relation ‘is_a’ creates a 
relation link A R C if the links A R B and 
B is_a C exist, as well as for A is_a B and B R C, 
whenever R has an all-some semantics. E.g. 
‘BRAF1_HUMAN has_function diacylglycerol 
binding’ and ‘diacylglycerol binding is_a lipid 
binding’, creates ‘BRAF1_HUMAN has_func­
tion lipid binding’. 
4.  The inferencing from the relation hierarchy 
creates a relation link A R B if the link A S B 
exists, and if S is a subrelation of R. E.g. ‘AKIP 
_HUMAN negatively_regulates mitosis’ creates 
‘AKIP_HUMAN regulates mitosis’. 
5.  A compositional closure creates a relation link 
A R C if the links A S B and B T C exist and if

Figure 2. A SPARUL update query that computes the compositional closure of GOA annotations for Homo Sapiens. In this update, a composition like 
‘located_in plus part_of results in located_in’ is extracted from BioMetarel and operated over the Gene Ontology and the GOA data 
the relations S, T and R, not necessarily all 
different, form a composite (role chain). E.g. 
‘NARF_HUMAN located_in nuclear lumen’ and 
‘nuclear 
lumen 
part_of 
nucleus’ 
creates 
‘NARF_HUMAN located_in nucleus’. 
Somewhat counterintuitively, relations with an all-
some semantics can not have inverses. Consequently, 
they can not be symmetric either, as this would imply 
they are their own inverses. Consider for example the 
statement ‘feather part_of animal’. As every feather 
is part of a bird, and every bird is an animal, this can 
be considered a sound statement. The inverse 
statement ‘animal has_part feather’, meaning that 
every animal has some feather as part, is clearly 
nonsense. To indicate e.g. that every feather is part of 
some bird, and also every bird has some feather as 
part, annotators should use two statements. 
Creating the Closures 
As an application, we created a relational closure 
over the relations in the Gene Ontology Annotations 
(GOA) 
and 
the 
Gene 
Ontology 
(GO) 
in 
BioGateway.18,19 By this we mean the explicit 
creation of all the relations that are relevant in 
queries from users, and that can be inferred from the 
documented relations in BioGateway and from the 
semantics of relations. We used the RDF update 
language SPARUL for computing and adding these 
relations as RDF triples.20 The method consists of 
four steps: 
1.  Creating Biorel.obo. This file expands RO.obo 
with all the relations that are used in the OBO 
Foundry, and with some extra tags for transitivity 
that were missing in RO.obo. 
2.  Creating BioMetarel. We merged the exports 
Biorel.rdf and Metarel.rdf to the BioMetarel 
RDF graph, with SPARUL. The enhancement of 
the semantic content for inferencing occurred in 
this step. 
3.  Creating the closure of the Gene Ontology. This 
was done by recursively running the SPARUL 
queries, (effectively applying the inferencing 
mechanisms in the previous section) on the 
BioMetarel and the GO graphs, until no further 
inferences could be made. The closure graph of 
GO contains 1.2 million triples, whereas the 
original GO graph contained only 0.57 million 
triples. 
4.  Creating the closure of the Gene Ontology 
Annotations. We created the compositional 
closure and the priority over is_a, for all the 
GOA graphs in BioGateway. The closure graph 
for Homo sapiens, for example, has 4.0 million 
triples, compared to 3.3 million triples for the 
normal graph. 
The preconstructed closures allow many useful 
queries with SPARQL, the RDF query language, that 
are otherwise not possible.21 Examples include 
finding the proteins that are located in the same 
protein complex and finding all the proteins with a 
given function or involved in a given process. All the 
original sources are kept separately, to allow 
querying on the original annotations. SPARQL 
queries that try to obtain similar results without 
closures are very complicated and computationally 
unperformant.

Conclusion 
We have shown how the relation ontology Metarel 
can be used to perform extensive inferencing in 
biomedical ontologies represented in RDF, a 
Semantic Web standard. For this, we integrated the 
OBO Foundry relations in the hierarchy of Metarel, 
and the ensuing biological relationship ontology 
BioMetarel was used to recursively inference in the 
RDF store BioGateway. Triples constructed by 
inferencing were propagated by operating SPARUL 
update queries over BioMetarel and the relevant 
biomedical ontologies. Such inferences allow more 
powerful queries, and essentially increase the value 
of RDF for Knowledge Management significantly.

Abstract 
There are a growing number of reference ontologies 
available across a variety of biomedical domains and 
current research focuses on their construction, 
organization and use. An important use case for these 
ontologies 
is 
annotation—where 
users 
create 
metadata that access concepts and terms in reference 
ontologies. 
We 
draw 
on 
our 
experience 
in 
physiological modeling to present a compelling use 
case that demonstrates the potential complexity of 
such annotations. In the domain of physiological 
biosimulation, we argue that most annotations 
require the use of multiple reference ontologies. We 
suggest that these “composite” annotations should 
be retained as a repository of knowledge about post-
coordination 
that 
promotes 
sharing 
and 
interoperation across biosimulation models. 
Connecting Multiple Reference Ontologies 
We define a reference ontology as a carefully-
constructed ontology that aims to completely cover a 
specific realm or domain of knowledge1,2. By 
definition, such an ontology must be both broad and 
deep in its domain, and designed for reusability 
across multiple sorts of users and use cases. In 
biology, 
one 
goal 
of 
the 
OBO 
resource 
(http://obofoundry.org/) 
is 
to 
encourage 
the 
development of non-overlapping reference ontologies 
so that users can unambiguously access terms from 
such ontologies. In biology, an exemplar reference 
ontology is the Foundational Model of Anatomy 
(FMA)2. 
Ontologies are most effective when they are 
designed with specific use cases in mind. For many, 
the motivating use case has been annotation: users 
need to add unambiguous semantic metadata about 
their raw data, whether that data is from genomic 
research, clinical findings, or images. To date, the 
conception of these annotations has been relatively 
simple. For example, a gene expression level from 
some experimental result will be annotated in-line 
with a Gene Ontology (GO) id, or possibly a direct 
URI to the relevant GO term. 
Annotations (even simple ones) provide a 
compelling justification for ontology development. 
Annotations allow external users, or even computer 
systems to explore and automatically align data and 
results across multiple sources. This use of 
annotations requires users to carry out two sorts of 
tasks: (1) annotating source data against ontologies, 
and (2) searching and integrating data from sources 
that use those ontologies for annotation. As others 
have pointed out, these tasks fit well into the 
intelligent information retrieval capabilities of the 
semantic web3. 
In this paper, we argue that this relatively simple 
use of annotation and ontologies can become very 
complex if annotations include multiple ontologies. 
Our domain of interest is in biosimulation, where 
researchers build models for understanding pathology 
or physiology. We show that when researchers 
annotate such models, they need to use multiple 
orthogonal ontologies. We present our preliminary 
architecture for these composite annotations, and 
describe prototype tools and ideas for the two user 
tasks described above: Annotating biosimulation 
models and then searching and integrating those 
models.  
As we show, these annotations provide a solution 
to one case of the post- vs. pre-coordination problem: 
there are too many properties of too many biological 
entities to attempt to pre-coordinate all combinations. 
Instead, via composite annotations, users can post-
coordinate concepts as needed, and store those 
combinations of terms across ontologies that are 
useful and relevant for their tasks. Without retaining 
this knowledge, ontology developers and end users 
are faced with a combinatorial problem—a cross 
product of terms across many large orthogonal 
ontologies.  
The Biophysical Semantics of Biosimulation 
For several years, our research group has been 
developing systems and ontologies for use with 
physiological 
biosimulation 
models. 
Recently, 
researchers have aimed at building a complete 
Physiome4, a flexible integration of component 
models 
into 
large-scale 
or 
special-purpose 
biosimulations for application to clinical and 
investigatory problems. Toward this goal, a number 
of libraries of biosimulation models have been made 
available, notably BioModels (an SBML collection, 
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), 
the 
CellML 
repository (http://www.cellml.org), and the JSim 
library (http://physiome.org/jsim/).

The fundamental challenge for integrating and 
understanding biosimulation models is that although 
these models are based on classical physics and 
formally expressed in mathematics, the semantics of 
these models—the meaning of variables and 
equations—is usually only implicit in model 
computational code (e.g. naming conventions) or 
annotated using ad hoc in-line code comments. 
Although current best practices in biosimulation 
modeling include adherence to some annotation 
standards5, these have not yet been widely adopted. 
We certainly applaud the use of OBO standards such 
as the FMA, ChEBI, GO, and the OBO Cell Type 
ontology. However, if annotations for biosimulation 
models are in-line, maintaining and searching over 
these annotations can be a challenge. 
In addition, all of the above ontologies are for 
biological structure and physical entities. For 
physiological modeling, it is important to also 
represent the principles by which such entities 
participate in processes. Recently, we have developed 
the Ontology of Physics for Biology (OPB)6, an 
ontology of the physical properties and physical laws 
by which biological processes occur. As such, it is 
orthogonal to strictly structural representations (e.g., 
FMA, ChEBI) in that it represents the physical 
properties that reside in structural entities. Thus, in 
biosimulation models, the elements of interest 
necessarily include both reference to structural 
entities of biology (e.g., blood, muscle, or smaller 
entities such as glucose or oxygen) as well as 
properties of those entities (e.g., flow, mass, or 
chemical concentration). Below, we provide specific 
examples of these composite annotations. 
Example Composite Annotations 
As a simple example, consider a common concept 
used in many cardiovascular biosimulation models: 
Aortic blood pressure. This concept may be mapped 
to differently named variables (Aop, AP, PAorta, etc) 
in different models. To integrate models that share 
this concept, these variables would have to be 
annotated with both the anatomical entity (blood-in­
aorta) as well as the physical property that is 
modeled: fluid pressure. This is a simple example, 
because it involves just two reference ontologies, the 
FMA and the OBP, and because fluid pressure is a 
property of the FMA entity blood-in-aorta. 
As a slightly more complex example, consider 
the concentration of oxygen in the blood of the aorta. 
This entity (which might be used by many different 
biosimulation models) needs three ontologies: 
ChEBI, for oxygen, the OPB, for chemical 
concentration, and the FMA, for blood in the aorta. If 
we omit any of these three ontologies, our 
representation is inaccurate or even erroneous. If we 
are not explicit about chemical concentration then we 
might be discussing (for example) the flow of oxygen 
in the aorta. If we omit the aorta, we might be 
discussing concentration of oxygen in the vena cava. 
Finally, we need ChEBI for oxygen as there are many 
other chemicals of interest in the aortic blood (e.g., 
calcium ion concentration). 
Finally, annotations become most complex in 
models that are multi-scale. Consider a model that 
includes glucose concentration in beta cells. It may 
matter a great deal whether that concentration is 
cytoplasmic, 
extracellular, 
arterial, 
or 
venous. 
Potentially, such a concept might need five reference 
ontologies: 
cell 
component 
(e.g., 
GO 
cell 
component), cell type (e.g. the OBO CellType), as 
well as the FMA, the OPB, and ChEBI. 
Effectively, composite annotations are recording 
“cross-products of interest” over the participating 
reference ontologies. Thus, one could imagine a set 
of tuples for pathway level biosimulation that were 
{OPB x ChEBI x FMA} or perhaps {OPB x ChEBI x 
GOCellComponent}. (In this conference, Mungall et 
al. also discuss a similar cross-product idea for the 
GO.7) However, the vast majority of such tuples 
would be nonsensical or not of interest for a 
particular 
model 
or 
group 
of 
biosimulation 
researchers (e.g., momentum of oxygen in the skull 
bone). In addition, our composite annotations need 
internal structure—formal terms that describe the 
relationship between, for example, blood and the 
aorta (“contained-in”). The research questions we 
raise deal with how to create, store, and retrieve for 
reuse, these sort of composite annotations. 
Managing Annotations: SemSim for Biosimulation 
For a single biosimulation model, we have developed 
an approach to composite annotation we call a 
“SemSim model” (for Semantic Simulation)8,9. 
SemSim models are OWL-based ontologies that 
capture the computational and semantic aspects of a 
biosimulation model, and they include a set of 
annotations for that particular biosimulation model. 
At most, there is one annotation per variable and 
equation in the source code. For variables, these are 
composite annotations, where each annotation has the 
structure we diagram in Figure 1. 
Biosimulation 
model 
variables, 
such 
as 
“PAorta”, are annotated by first mapping them to 
physical 
properties, 
such 
as 
pressure, 
flow, 
concentration, etc. These properties are defined in the 
OPB, and referenced in the composite annotation. It 
is these properties that take on numeric values during 
any given simulation run. As Figure 1 shows, these 
properties are then connected to the physical entities 
(via “has property” links) which then point to entities 
in structural reference ontologies. If there is more

A SemSim model is a collection of these annotations, for a set of variables as used in a specific piece of biosimulation code.  
than one entity and more than one structural ontology 
(e.g., oxygen in blood), then these are connected via 
“has structural relation” links. As we discuss later, 
where possible, we use the OBO relations ontology 
for such linking terms (part_of, contained_in, etc.). 
In contrast to current annotation practices, our 
SemSim models are external entities to both the 
reference ontologies and the biosimulation code. One 
advantage of this design is that the source code can 
remain un-modified, an important feature when 
annotating legacy code. A second advantage is that 
we can easily collect the set of all annotations as a 
repository for search and reuse. 
Creating Composite Annotations 
For biosimulation researchers, the structure shown in 
Figure 1 should be largely invisible. Thus, we have 
developed 
prototype 
tools 
that 
hide 
this 
representational complexity and help users author 
and create composite annotations from biosimulation 
source code. For creating annotations, our prototype 
tool, SemGen, parses the source code to find 
instances of variables, and then prompts the user for 
search terms to use with particular ontologies. The 
system then queries these ontologies to find exact 
matches and IDs for the terms, and finally generates 
the composite annotation as part of a SemSim model.  
As we develop a larger repository of annotations 
for biosimulation models, our SemGen system can 
better assist users. For, example, if a model uses a 
variable 
that 
captures 
“cytoplasmic 
glucose 
concentration in pancreatic beta cells”, then this 
annotation could require five searches across five 
participating reference ontologies. However, if some 
other user has already created a similar or related 
annotation, then the SemGen system can return a list 
of these as soon as the user enters any one of these 
terms. E.g., as soon as  “glucose” is entered, the 
system could return a list of all prior glucose 
annotations, and one of these may be a close or 
perfect match for the user. 
Because there are relatively few biosimulation 
models available, the number of useful composite 
annotations for models is small, at least compared to 
the cross product of the cardinality of the reference 
ontologies. Thus, annotators help us carry out post-
coordination 
of 
terminologies: 
the 
composite 
annotations are created only on an as-needed basis, 
and then stored in a repository for reuse. 
Using Annotations to Search and Merge Models 
As we alluded to earlier, there are two sorts of user 
tasks for annotations. In addition to creating 
composite 
annotations, 
users 
need 
to 
search 
annotations and their models, and then perhaps merge 
or adapt models created by others. Reusing and 
adapting others’ models is common in biosimulation 
engineering, but currently, this work is manual, 
costly, error-prone, and typically requires extensive 
communication 
and 
collaboration 
between 
bioengineers.9 
In prior publications, we have presented early 
results that show how our SemSim approach would 
make model merging semi-automatic.8,9 Although 
promising, this preliminary work avoids some of the 
broader indexing and retrieval challenges for a 
repository of composite annotations. In particular, for 
semantic web use cases, composite annotations need 
(a) a unique name or URI, and (b) indices for 
appropriately efficient retrieval. We can assume that 
each reference ontology term (such as “FMA: blood 
in aorta”) already has a URI. Thus, although 
unwieldy, one could use URIs for composite 
annotations that simply consist of concatenations of 
the URIs of each reference ontology term.

We believe that users may want to search the 
annotation repository in a variety of ways. Thus, it 
seems likely that these annotations will need to be 
indexed with all of their component terms. To 
continue with the glucose example, users may want 
to begin with glucose, or pancreatic beta cells, or 
“cytoplasmic glucose” and therefore, all of these 
should be indexed, so that the system can retrieve the 
full term regardless of how the user searches. 
Managing Orthogonal Ontologies: OBO Relations 
The 
management 
of 
multiple 
ontologies 
for 
annotating biosimulation models is just a specific 
example of managing multiple orthogonal ontologies. 
This issue is faced by the OBO set of ontologies, and 
partially addressed by the OBO Relation Ontology. 
This ontology provides the formal relations needed to 
describe how the structural entities in a composite 
annotation relate to each other. For example, for 
cytoplasmic glucose concentration in beta cells, we 
can say precisely that we are referring to the 
cytoplasm (GO CellComponent) that is “part of” 
(OBO relation) the pancreatic B cell (OBO 
CellType). 
Thus, the OBO relations ontology provides the 
ability to appropriately link entities across OBO 
ontologies that pertain to structural entities. However, 
this 
ontology 
does 
not 
include 
relationships 
appropriate for connecting non-structural ontologies 
such as the OPB. How should the notion of 
“pressure” be related to the concept of “blood”? In 
our SemSim approach, we currently use the generic 
“has property” relation for such links. 
Pragmatically, our initial work has focused on 
managing and building composite annotations. We 
certainly use the OBO relation ontology where 
appropriate, but as a first goal, building a corpus of 
useful composite annotations will be a significant 
contribution, and can ease the task of biosimulation 
model integration. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
In this paper, we describe composite annotations to 
represent entities of interest to biosimulation 
modelers. In addition, we propose that these 
annotations can be used as a way of storing 
knowledge about post-coordination, so that useful 
terms such as “concentration of oxygen in blood of 
aorta” can be easily retrieved or created on-the-fly. 
Elsewhere, we demonstrated the value of such 
annotations for merging biosimulation models, and 
here, we raise issues and propose possible solutions 
for building a semantic web repository of such 
composite annotations. 
In support of the Physiome vision, the 
biosimulation research community is working to 
integrate models to build larger and more complex 
models (with the expectation that such models are 
more predictive and useful). We argue that reference 
ontologies and tool support could provide significant 
assistance with this work. However, a key first step to 
integrating models is a solid understanding of the 
semantics of model variables and equations. We 
propose that a repository of composite annotations 
could both make annotation of additional models 
easier, as well as allow researchers and systems to 
find variables that share common semantics across 
biosimulation models.

Abstract 
While the Web Ontology Language (OWL) provides a 
mechanism to import ontologies, this mechanism is 
not always suitable. First, given the current state of 
editing tools and the issues they have working with 
large ontologies, direct OWL imports have sometimes 
proven impractical for day-to-day development. 
Second, ontologies chosen for integration may be 
under active development and not aligned with the 
chosen design principles. Importing heterogeneous 
ontologies 
in 
their 
entirety 
may 
lead 
to 
inconsistencies or unintended inferences. In this 
paper we propose a set of guidelines for importing 
required terms from an external resource into a 
target ontology. We describe the guidelines, their 
implementation, 
present 
some 
examples 
of 
application, and outline future work and extensions. 
Introduction 
While the Web Ontology Language (OWL1) provides 
a mechanism to import ontologies (owl:imports), 
current limitations in tools and reasoners can 
sometimes make such a solution impractical on a 
day-to-day basis. First, some OWL tools (e.g., 
Protégé, SWOOP) can neither load or reason over 
very large ontologies, such as the NCBI Taxonomy2 
or the Foundational Model of Anatomy3, making 
direct OWL imports of such ontologies impractical. 
Second, 
different 
resources 
may 
have 
been 
constructed using different design principles, which 
may not align. Importing such ontologies as a whole 
could 
lead 
to 
inconsistencies 
or 
unintended 
inferences. 
To address these issues, we have developed a set of 
guidelines for importing terms from multiple 
ontology resources, avoiding the overhead of 
importing the complete ontology from which the 
terms derive. 
The Minimum Information to Reference an External 
Ontology Term (MIREOT) guidelines were created 
to aid the development of the Ontology of 
Biomedical Investigations (OBI4). OBI uses the 
Basic Formal Ontology (BFO5) as upper-level 
ontology and is part of the Open Biomedical 
Ontologies (OBO) Foundry6. One of the fundamental 
principles of the OBO Foundry is to reuse, where 
sensible, existing ontology resources, therefore 
avoiding 
duplication 
of 
effort 
and 
ensuring 
orthogonality. MIREOT allows us to do so by 
providing a way to import external terms from 
ontologies not yet using BFO as an upper ontology, 
or not yet using OWL DL.  
Policy 
In deciding upon a minimum unit of import, our first 
step was to consider the practice of other ontologies.  
For example, in the Gene Ontology (GO7), the 
intended denotation of classes remains stable. Even 
when the ontology is repaired or reorganized, the 
effects of such changes do not change the intended 
meaning of individual terms. Rather the changes are 
towards more carefully expressing the logical relations 
between them. When a term’s definition changes 
meaning, the term is deprecated8. We can therefore 
consider a term as stable, in isolation from the rest of 
the ontology, and use terms (i.e. individual classes in 
isolation from the ontology) as basic unit of import. 
The current implementation of MIREOT has been 
limited to import of terms from other Foundry 
ontologies, which adhere to a similar deprecation 
policy. 
The minimum amount of information needed to 
reference an external class is the source ontology 
URI and the external term’s URI. Generally, these 
items 
remain 
stable 
and 
can 
be 
used 
to 
unambiguously reference the external class from 
within the importing target ontology. The minimum 
amount of information to integrate this class is its 
position in the hierarchy, specifically the URI of its 
direct superclass in the target ontology. 
Taken together, the following minimal set is enough 
to consistently reference an external term: 
•  Source Ontology URI. The logical URI of the 
ontology containing the external term to be 
imported. 
87

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
•  Source Term URI. The logical URI of the 
specific term to import. 
•  Target Direct Superclass URI. The logical URI 
of the direct asserted superclass in the target 
ontology. 
To ease development of the target ontology we also 
recommend, although do not require, that additional 
information about the external class be added such as 
its label and textual definition. 
Implementation 
An implementation of the MIREOT guidelines was 
performed in the context of the OBI project, and can 
be decomposed into a two-step process: 
1.  Gather the minimum information for the external 
class. 
2.  Use 
this 
minimum 
information 
to 
fetch 
additional elements, like labels and definitions.  
Once the external term is identified for import, the 
first step is to gather the corresponding minimum 
information set.  
This set is stored in a file that we call external.owl 
(http://tinyurl.com/b7vvlt). A Perl script, add-to­
external.pl9 is used to automatically append the 
minimum information set to the external.owl file. 
This script takes as arguments the identifiers of the 
external class to be imported and its parent class in 
the target hierarchy, in this case in the OBI hierarchy. 
In addition, a mapping mechanism between the prefix 
used in the identifier and the external source 
ontology URI is built into the script. Curators 
therefore need only specify the ID of the external 
class to import and the ID of the class it should be 
imported under, within the target ontology.  
Figure 1. Template SPARQL query. For convenience, we use 
alias:preferredTerm and alias:definition to reference our annotations 
properties IAO 0000111 and IAO 000011511 respectively. 
Additional elements can be obtained programmatically 
via SPARQL10 CONSTRUCT queries, as described in 
Figure 1 (see also http://tinyurl.com/bss9mw). These 
queries specify which extra information about the class 
to gather, such as the definition and preferred label, 
and how to map these into the corresponding OBI 
annotation properties.  
For example, in the current OWL rendering of OBO 
files, definitions are individuals and the rdfs:label of 
those individuals record the text of the definitions. 
Within the OBI implementation of the MIREOT 
guidelines, only annotation properties that map 
directly to our own metadata are mapped: new 
properties (e.g., curation status annotation property, 
definition editor or definition source), if not specified 
in the source ontology, are not created.  
The external term is directly imported from the 
external resource, with the status and definition as 
defined by the external resource. Finally, a script, 
create-external-derived.lisp9 , iterates through the 
minimum 
information 
stored 
in 
external.owl. 
Depending on the source ontology URI of each of 
our imported terms, it then selects the correct 
SPARQL template and substitutes the relevant ID. 
The 
queries 
are 
then 
executed 
against 
the 
Neurocommons SPARQL endpoint12. 
This supplementary information, which is prone to 
change as the source ontologies evolve, is stored in a 
second file, externalDerived.owl (http://tinyurl.com/ 
bmb3f4). This file can be removed on a regular basis, 
e.g., before release of OBI. It is then rebuilt via script 
based on external.owl, allowing us to keep imported 
information up-to-date. The two files, external.owl 
and externalDerived.owl, are then imported by 
obi.owl, providing the necessary information to OBI 
editors while at the same time keeping it independent 
from OBI proper classes.  
In the following sections we present two different 
cases of application of the MIREOT guidelines.  
Use Case One – Cell Class  
We replaced the OBI class cell with that from the 
Cell Type (CL) ontology13. CL is part of the OBO 
Foundry effort, and we would like to use the cell 
class as defined by this resource, instead of creating 
our own duplicated class. The following invocation 
of the add-to-external.pl script 
   perl add-to-external.pl CL:0000000 IAO:0000018  
will add the class cell (CL:0000000) as subclass of 
the class material entity (IAO:0000018), and set the 
source ontology URI as http://purl.org/obo/owl/CL. 
Once imported, the cell class can be used as would be 
any other OBI class. For example, the process 
“electroporation” is defined as: 
88

 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is_a cell permeabilization 
has_specified_input some cell 
has_specified_output some 
(cell and has_quality some electroporated))  
utilizes_device some power supply  
More generally, additional axioms may be used to 
relate members of the class to other entities in the 
ontology.  
Use Case Two – Taxonomic Information  
The cell use case highlights what is likely to be the 
most common import scenario, i.e. a simple import of 
one external term, making it available for direct use 
in the target ontology. However, in some cases, we 
may require more, and to account for this MIREOT 
has been devised to be flexible.  
OBI currently uses the NCBI taxonomy for its species 
terms. We can easily imagine that somebody would 
want to query a dataset asking the question “give me 
all experiments in mammals”. In this case, we would 
need to know that human and mouse are subclasses 
(even indirect) of mammals in the NCBI taxonomy. 
Therefore, when mapping towards an NCBI term, it is 
needed to get the class itself and all its superclasses up 
to one of a set of top-level classes in the taxonomy. 
Figure 2. Template SPARQL query. For convenience, we use 
alias:preferredTerm and alias:definition to reference our annotations 
properties IAO 0000111 and IAO 000011511 respectively. 
When the create-external-derived.lisp script parses 
the external.owl file and encounters an NCBI 
taxonomy ID, it will therefore invoke a specific 
SPARQL query (Figure 2). As per the mechanism 
described above, the minimum information about the 
imported external class (e.g., Mus musculus) is 
defined in external.owl, whereas the additional 
information (rank information - genus, kingdom, 
phylum, etc.) is stored in externalDerived.owl. 
Discussion 
The MIREOT standard is a trade-off between 
complete consistency checking and heavyweight 
importing versus lightweight importing but partial 
consistency checking. We are aware of and accept 
that by copying only parts of an ontology there is the 
risk that inferences drawn may be incomplete or 
incorrect: correct inference using the external classes 
is only guaranteed if the full ontologies are imported. 
When deciding to import an external term we review 
the textual definition and, if needed, talk with the 
original editor. As we are importing from OBO 
Foundry ontologies we have a community process for 
monitoring change, a shared understanding of the 
basics of our domain, and the intention to eventually 
share the same upper-level ontology. Therefore, we 
expect that terms will be deprecated if there is a 
significant change in meaning, and are flexible enough 
to adjust and update our import of terms as the other 
ontologies start enhancing their logical definitions. 
Another consideration using this approach is the status 
of assertions made on external terms. In adding axioms 
such as the subclass axiom when importing the 
external term, the aim is to only assert true statements. 
If additional restrictions are required (for example in 
OBI, cell is the bearer of the role reagent role or 
specimen role), those should be stored in the target 
ontology: the external.owl and externalDerived.owl 
are meant to include only the imported information. 
We anticipate that some of the statements added by the 
target ontology may migrate to the source ontologies at 
some point in the future; a fruit of the collaborative 
nature of OBO Foundry ontology development. 
Future Work 
The current implementation of the MIREOT guidelines 
relies on command-line scripts, making it sometimes 
uncomfortable to use for our curators. Ideally, a 
Protégé14 plug-in could be developed to improve the 
interaction between the curators and the tool and the 
implementation of the MIREOT guidelines.  
In the future, we also expect to provide an option in 
the OBI distribution that replaces external.owl with 
imports.owl, a file of imports statements generated by 
extracting 
the 
ontology 
URIs 
mentioned 
in 
external.owl. 
The MIREOT guidelines are currently being 
implemented by other ontologies, like the Vaccine 
Ontology (VO15), and we ultimately hope that 
combined feedback will allow us to perfect the 
mechanism.

Towards Context-Driven Modularization of Large Biomedical Ontologies 
Pinar Oezden Wennerberg, Sonja Zillner  
Siemens AG, Munich, Germany  
Abstract 
Formal knowledge about human anatomy, radiology 
or diseases is necessary to support clinical 
applications such as medical image search. This 
machine processable knowledge can be acquired 
from biomedical domain ontologies, which however, 
are typically very large and complex models. Thus, 
their straightforward incorporation into the software 
applications becomes difficult. In this paper we 
discuss first ideas on a statistical approach for 
modularizing large medical ontologies and we 
prioritize the practical applicability aspect. The 
underlying assumption is that the application 
relevant ontology fragments, i.e. modules, can be 
identified by the statistical analysis of the ontology 
concepts in the domain corpus. Accordingly, we 
argue that most frequently occurring concepts in the 
domain corpus define the application context and 
can therefore potentially yield the relevant ontology 
modules. We illustrate our approach on an example 
case that involves a large ontology on human 
anatomy and report on our first manual experiments.   
Introduction 
Medical research and clinical practice deal with 
complex and heterogeneous data, which poses 
challenges to realizing applications such as medical 
image and text search. Thus, it becomes necessary to 
support these applications with machine processable, 
explicit medical knowledge e.g., about human 
anatomy, radiology or diseases. This knowledge can be 
acquired from biomedical domain ontologies and can 
be used in the application, for example in semantic 
medical image and text search. Semantic medical 
image search is, indeed, the context of this work that 
lies within the THESEUS MEDICO research project.   
Based on experience throughout the MEDICO 
project, we have observed that biomedical ontologies 
are typically very complex and comprehensive. This 
characteristic makes it difficult to use them 
straightforwardly in the target application due to 
efficiency reasons. At the same time, not all of the 
knowledge contained is relevant for the application 
context. In most cases, there is a specific set of 
ontology concepts and relations that sufficiently 
provide the required information. Using only parts of 
the ontology that are relevant for the application in 
mind allows for a significant improvement in the 
efficiency.  
In MEDICO one use case focuses on patients 
suffering from lymphoma in the neck area. 
Lymphoma is a type of cancer in lymphocytes and it 
is a systematic disease with manifestations in multiple 
organs. During its diagnosis and treatment imaging is 
done several times based on the use of different 
imaging modalities (e.g. CT scan, X-Ray, MRI). This 
makes the lymphoma use case particularly relevant 
for a flexible medical image and text search 
application.    
In this paper we describe our first ideas on an 
approach 
for 
modularizing 
large 
biomedical 
ontologies and illustrate it on the example of a large 
and comprehensive ontology about human anatomy. 
It is based on identifying statistically most relevant 
ontology concepts from domain corpora, in our case 
a corpus on lymphomas. We argue that these 
concepts can be used to distinguish the parts of 
ontologies that are most relevant for the application 
context. These parts can potentially yield the 
ontology modules that provide sufficient knowledge 
for the purposes of the software application. The 
modules identified in this way will additionally be 
discussed with the clinical experts for quality 
assessment and relevance. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Next 
section presents the related work. We then proceed 
with describing the relevant sources with a focus on 
the domain corpus and explain the statistical analysis 
process. In the Module Identification subsection we 
discuss the first (manually) identified modules 
supporting our ideas and assumptions. These are 
displayed in form of sub-hierarchies accessible 
through the UMLS tree browser. The paper concludes 
with first observations, discussions and future work. 
Related Work 
In most cases the application scenario, the level of 
detail and the complexity of the medical knowledge 
determines the way how the modules should be 
identified. In other words, there is no well-defined or 
broadly accepted definition for the “one and only 
way” to modularize ontologies. On the contrary, 
many different approaches and techniques for 
ontology modularization have been implemented.2,3,4 
Most views agree that there is no universal way to

modularize ontologies and that the choice of a 
particular technique should be guided by the 
requirements 
of 
the 
considered 
application. 
Spaccapieta5 and d’Aquin6 provide a good overview 
of concepts and methods for achieving scalability 
through modularization of ontologies. 
In general, ontology modularization can be addressed 
automatically or user-driven, but in both cases the 
modularization of the ontology is a challenging task. 
For example, ontology modularization approaches 
that guarantee logical consistency7 may deliver too 
large fragments and can be slow in performance. On 
the other hand graph-based approaches8 are more 
efficient but they do not guarantee the logical 
completeness. Finally, manually created ontology 
fragments9 do naturally have the required level of 
granularity but they are expensive in terms of time 
and resources and are open to human errors.  
The technique introduced in this paper has the 
objective to enable a semi-automatic identification of 
ontology modules and it does not prioritize 
completeness. Rather, we account for the practical 
applicability of the extracted modules to improve the 
efficiency of the application. Nevertheless, the 
extracted modules shall be discussed with clinical 
experts for quality assessment. 
Materials and Methods 
Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA)10 ontology 
is the most comprehensive machine processable 
resource on human anatomy. It covers 71,202 distinct 
anatomical concepts (e.g., ‘Neuraxis’ and its 
synonym ‘Central nervous system’) and more than 
1.5 million relations instances from 170 relation 
types. In addition to the hierarchical is-a relation, 
concepts are connected by seven kinds of part-of 
relationships (e.g., ‘part of’, ‘constitutional part of’, 
‘regional part of’ etc.) The version we currently refer 
to is the version available in March 2009. 
PubMed Lymphoma Corpus 
The lymphoma corpus is based on medical 
publication abstracts on lymphoma from PubMed11 
scientific abstracts database. Its purpose is to provide 
specific domain knowledge about lymphoma, as this 
is one major use case of MEDICO. To establish the 
corpus we first extracted a set of the lymphoma 
relevant concepts from the NCI Thesaurus and then 
used these to identify from PubMed most frequently 
reported lymphomas, which are ‘Non-Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma’, ‘Burkitt’s Lymphoma’, ‘T-Cell Non­
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma’, ‘Follicular Lymphoma’, 
‘Hodgkin’s Lymphoma’, ‘Diffuse Large B-Cell 
Lymphoma’, ‘Aids Related Lymphoma’, ‘Extranodal 
Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-
Associated 
Lymphoid 
Tissue’, 
‘Mantle 
Cell 
Lymphoma’, ‘Cutenous T-Cell Lymphoma’. For each 
lymphoma type we compiled a set of XML 
documents that are generated from the PubMed 
abstracts. The text sections of the XML files were 
run through the TnT part-of-speech parser to extract 
all nouns and adjectives in the corpus.  
The reason for including adjectives is based on our 
observations with the concept labels. Especially for 
the anatomy domain, the adjectives carry information 
that can be significant for medical decisions, for 
example, when determining whether an image is 
related to the right or to the left ventricle of the heart. 
Therefore, throughout the paper, when we talk about 
concepts, we refer to both adjectives and nouns. Then 
a relevance score (chi-square) for each noun and 
adjective 
was 
computed 
by 
comparing 
their 
frequencies in the domain specific corpus with those 
in the British National Corpus (BNC).12 The resulting 
corpus consists of 71.973 files. 
Statistical Analysis of Concepts 
The objective of the statistical analysis is to identify a 
set of concepts that are most relevant for the 
application and for the use case. The process starts 
with converting the ontology into a flat list of 
concepts after some filtering is applied to the concept 
labels in the same way as explained in our previous 
work13. The statistically most relevant concepts are 
then identified on the basis of chi-square scores 
computed for nouns and adjectives. Ontology 
concepts that are single words and that occur in the 
corpus, correspond directly to the noun/adjective that 
the concept is build up of. For example, the noun 
‘ear’ from the corpus corresponds to the FMA 
concept ‘Ear’. Thus, the statistical relevance of the 
ontology concept is the chi-square score of the 
corresponding noun/adjective.  
In the case of multi-word ontology concepts, the 
statistical relevance is computed on the basis of the 
chi-square score for each constituting noun and/or 
adjective in the concept name, summed and 
normalized over its length. Thus, relevance value for 
‘Lymph node’, for example, is the summation of the 
chi-square scores for ‘Lymph’ and ‘node’ divided by 
2. In order to take frequency into account, we further 
multiplied the summed relevance value by the 
frequency of the term. This assures that only 
frequently occurring terms are judged as relevant. A 
selection from the list of most relevant FMA concepts 
in the corpus is shown below (Table 1). We only 
focused on the Mantle Cell Lymphoma collection of 
the PubMed corpus, however currently we are 
extending the profiles to the rest.

Identification of Potential Modules 
Module identification starts with locating the 
statistically most relevant ontology concepts in the 
ontology hierarchy. The work reported in this paper 
was done manually. For the first experiments, we 
examined the context of the three concepts; ‘Inguinal 
lymph node’, ‘Plasma cell’ and ‘Plasma membrane’. 
To locate the concepts in the hierarchy we used the 
UMLS Knowledge Server and selected the FMA 
view. We then searched for the three concepts using 
exact match. The hierarchical contexts are displayed 
below (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). 
The locations of the ‘Inguinal lymph node’, ‘Plasma 
cell’ and ‘Plasma membrane’ in the FMA hierarchy 
display the ‘Anatomical structure’ as their next 
common parent. Therefore, it is most likely to be the 
root of the ontology module. The sum of the shortest 
paths from each concept (i.e. ‘Inguinal lymph node’, 
‘Plasma 
cell’ 
and 
‘Plasma 
membrane’) 
to 
‘Anatomical structure’ will, in this case, be appended 
to it as its children. The sub-hierarchy consisting of 
‘Anatomical structure’ as root and ‘Cardinal organ 
part’, ‘Cell’ and ‘Cardinal cell part’ as its children 
(and the children’s descendants) may then be the 
potential 
ontology 
module. 
Consequently, 
the 
expectation from this module would be that it 
contains sufficient information about anatomy that 
relates to lymphoma.   
First Observations and Discussion 
The concept labels reveal lexical overlaps. This 
suggests that further interrelations can be discovered 
by comparing the descendant concept labels at the 
lexical level. In this way, we expect to be able to find 
lexical correspondences that potentially convey 
further useful hierarchical information. 
One drawback we have observed is that the ontology 
modules can be rather large. This means that it would 
be hard to identify the focus of the module. One 
possible way to avoid too large and too generic 
ontology modules may be by allowing only a certain 
number of concepts that were identified as 
statistically relevant and then by locating only these 
in the hierarchy. We currently investigate this.

Future Work 
As next the semi-automatic identification of the 
ontology 
modules 
will 
be 
realized. 
UMLS 
Knowledge Source Server and other tools from the 
National Library of Medicine14 can support this 
process. Once this is achieved, it becomes relevant to 
identify the correspondences between the sub-
hierarchies. Lexical methods e.g., string similarity 
and overlap detection, can be used to discover 
correspondences between the concept labels. A long 
term but an important research question concerns 
finding an effective strategy to identify the optimal 
size for each module. It is essential to be able to

determine when to terminate appending children to 
the module hierarchy. This is a challenging task, as 
optimal size, logical completeness and consistency 
usually require compromising.

Debugging Mappings between Biomedical Ontologies: 
Preliminary Results from the NCBO BioPortal Mapping Repository

Abstract 
The ability to provide semantic mappings between 
multiple large biomedical ontologies is considered as 
a very important, albeit labor-intensive and error-
prone task. To facilitate such a process, several 
approaches for collaborative ontology mapping 
building and sharing have been proposed in the 
recent past. However, despite the improvements in 
community-wide mappings development, more often 
the mapping rules are redundant, incoherent, and at 
times, incorrect. In this paper, we present an 
approach for identifying such “erroneous mappings” 
using Distributed Description Logics. Specifically, 
we illustrate how logical reasoning can be used to 
discover 
semantic 
inconsistencies 
caused 
by 
erroneous mappings, and provide preliminary results 
of experiments based on the National Center for 
Biomedical Ontology BioPortal mapping repository. 
Introduction 
The ability to specify semantic mappings between 
biomedical ontologies is an important research 
agenda in the medical informatics community. 
Several 
approaches 
have 
been 
proposed 
for 
alignment between ontologies ranging from entirely 
manual1, to semi-automatic2,3, to fully-automatic4 
mapping techniques, many of which have met with 
varying degrees of success. More recently, with the 
growing number of ontologies in the biomedical 
domain, and hence the increasing requirement for 
their alignment, community-based approaches to 
create mappings have been proposed that allow users 
and 
domain 
experts 
to 
specify 
semantic 
correspondences 
in 
a 
collaborative 
manner5,6. 
However, despite these advancements, an important 
limitation of the existing efforts is the lack of ability 
to identify, debug, and invalidate semantically 
inconsistent mappings (or erroneous mappings). As 
mentioned by Noy et al.5, such a requirement is vital 
because in many cases a concept definition may 
change with a new version of the ontology, and 
thereby making an existing mapping invalid, or users 
may add new or delete existing mappings that result 
in the aligned ontologies becoming logically 
inconsistent.  
Toward this end, we propose a technique for 
identifying  erroneous mappings between biomedical 
ontologies. In particular, we exploit the underlying 
semantics of the mappings as well as the mapped 
ontologies based on Distributed Description Logics 
(DDL)7 to pinpoint mappings that are logically 
inconsistent8. Our basic assumption is that a mapping 
that correctly states the semantic correspondences 
between the ontology concepts should not cause 
inconsistencies in the mapped ontologies. The 
advantage of using DDL is that it allows us to detect 
such inconsistencies, which can then be regarded as 
symptoms caused by erroneous mappings. For 
example, Figure 1 shows two equivalent mappings 
between concepts A and B in ontology O1 (source) 
with concepts C and D in ontology O2 (target), 
respectively. Furthermore, B is asserted as a 
subConcept of A in O1, whereas both C and D are 
asserted as disjoint from each other in O2. Assuming 
that both the mappings are valid as well as ontologies 
O1 and O2 are logically consistent, one can infer (via 
global interpretation) that the concept D should be a 
subConcept of C in O2. However, since they are 
asserted as disjoint in O2, thereby causing a logical 
inconsistency, implies that at least one of the 
mappings is erroneous—identification of which is 
our objective. Specifically, the main contributions of 
the proposed work are: 
• We leverage DDL7 and ontology mapping repair 
techniques8 to describe a formal framework for 
identifying erroneous biomedical ontology mappings. 
• We illustrate the applicability of our approach by 
experimenting with the NCBO BioPortal mapping 
repository5 and provide preliminary results. 
• We 
provide 
an 
open-source 
prototype 
implementation of our software based on the 
DRAGO 
distributed 
reasoning 
system:

Background 
Distributed 
Description 
Logics 
(DDL)7 
is 
a 
knowledge representation formalism for representing 
sets of ontologies and semantic relations between 
them. It provides a mechanism for referring to 
ontologies and for defining rules that connect 
“concepts” in different ontologies. This is achieved 
using the notion of importing and reusing concepts 
between ontologies and enabling reasoning with 
multiple 
ontologies 
connected 
by 
directional 
semantic mapping (called the bridge rules). In 
particular, DDL extends the notion of interpretation 
introduced above to fit the distributed nature of the 
model and to reason about concept subsumption 
across ontologies. 
More formally, let I be a set of non-empty 
indices such that {Oi}i∈I is a set of ontologies. 
Concepts and axioms are represented with the index 
of the ontology they belong to such that i:C denotes a 
concept in ontology Oi and j:C⊆D represents that 
concept C is a sub-concept of D in ontology Oj , 
where i:C and j:C are different concepts. Semantic 
relations between concepts in different ontologies are 
represented via axioms, called bridge rules that are of 
the following form: (1) i:C → j:D (into-rule); and (2) 
i:C ← j:D (onto-rule); where, C and D are concepts 
in ontologies Oi and Oj , respectively. Furthermore, 
the derived bridge rule i:C≡j : D can be defined as a 
conjunction of the into- and onto-bridge rules. These 
rules do not represent the semantic relations stated 
from an external observation point of view such as 
the Web. Instead, a rule i to j expresses relations 
between i and j viewed from j-th subjective point of 
view. Specifically, an into-bridge rule i:C→j:D states 
that, from j-th point of view, the concept C in i is less 
general that its “local” concept D. Equivalently, the 
onto-relation i:C←j:D expresses the more generality 
relation. In general, note that the into-rule (i:C→j:D) 
is not necessarily an inverse of the onto-rule 
(i:C←j:D) since these rules reflect a subjective point 
of view. Thus, a “distributed ontology” DOR can now 
be defined as a tuple, ({Oi}i∈I, {Rij}i≠j∈I), where 
{Oi}i∈I is the set of ontologies, and {Rij}i≠j∈I is the set 
of bridge rules between those ontologies.  
An important aspect of DDL is that for the 
fundamental reasoning services of verification of 
consistency and concept satisfiability, in addition to 
the ontology itself, the reasoning depends on other 
ontologies to which it has semantic mappings. This is 
due to the ability of the bridge rules to transitively 
propagate knowledge across ontologies in the form 
of subsumption axioms as illustrated in Figure 2. 
The main objective of our work is to leverage 
DDL7 and existing techniques for repairing ontology 
mappings8 to provide a formal framework for 
identifying erroneous mappings between biomedical 
ontologies. In what follows, we formalize ontology 
mappings (with respect to DDL) and outline steps for 
identifying erroneous mappings. 
Mappings and Correspondences: At an abstract 
level, a mapping between source Oi and target 
ontologies Oj is defined via a set of correspondences, 
where each correspondence represents a semantic 
relation between concepts in Oi and Oj. 
Definition 1 (Semantic Correspondence): Given 
ontologies Oi and Oj , a semantic correspondence can 
be represented (minimally) by a 3-tuple <C,C′,r>, 
such that C∈F(Oi), C′∈F(Oj), and r is a semantic 
relation, where F is a function that identifies elements 
in Oi and Oj. Furthermore, in this work, we restrict r 
to the set {≡, ⊆, ⊇}, essentially limiting to 
equivalence and subsumption. Given a set of 
semantic correspondences, we can define the notion 
of 
a 
mapping 
as 
a 
collection 
of 
such 
correspondences. 
Definition 2 (Ontology Mapping): Given ontologies 
Oi and Oj, M is a mapping between Oi and Oj , iff for 
all correspondences <C,C′,r>∈M, we have C∈F(Oi), 
and C′∈F(Oj). 
To formalize ontology mappings in terms of 
DDL presented earlier, we encode the semantic 
correspondences as bridge rules. In particular, each 
correspondence 
<C,C′,r> 
between 
a 
pair 
of 
ontologies Oi and Oj is translated into a bridge rule 
via a translation function T as follows: 
Inconsistent Mappings. A mapping M of a distributed 
ontology ℑ can be defined as inconsistent with 
respect to a particular concept i:C if it becomes 
unsatisfiable modulo the mappings 
Definition 3 (Mapping Consistency): Given a 
distributed ontology ℑ, the mapping M between 
ontologies Oi,Oj∈ℑ is consistent with respect to a 
concept i:C iff concept C is unsatisfiable in Oi 
implies that i:C is also unsatisfiable in ℑ. Otherwise, 
M is inconsistent with respect to i:C. By 
extrapolation, M is consistent with respect to Oi iff 
for all i:C, M is consistent with respect to i:C; 
otherwise M is inconsistent with respect to Oi. 
For example, based on Figure 1, M = {O1:A ≡ 
O2:C, O1:B ≡ O2:D}. Furthermore, by applying 
96

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distributed reasoning it can be inferred that O2:D⊆C 
should hold. However, at the same time both C and D 
are defined as disjoint concepts in O2, thereby 
making M inconsistent with respect to D since it 
cannot be satisfied in the global interpretation. 
Algorithm 1 follows directly from Definition 3 which 
also states that the inconsistency of one ontology, or 
some sub-group of connected ontologies, does not 
automatically render the entire distributed ontology 
inconsistent. Arguably, the goal is to determine an 
erroneous mapping set and identify which of the 
semantic correspondences involved can be removed 
to maintain consistency. In particular, we want to 
determine a “minimal erroneous mapping set” which 
has the property that none of its subset is an 
erroneous mapping set. 
Evaluation 
Materials. We evaluated our methods proposed 
above 
using 
the 
NCBO 
BioPortal 
mappings 
repository. As stated in Noy and Musen5, the inability 
to impose any quality control on the mappings that 
the users submit is a limitation of the existing 
BioPortal infrastructure, and our work provides 
preliminary steps in addressing this requirement. 
At the time of our evaluation, the repository 
contained approximately 30,000 mappings between 
various biomedical ontologies, and a majority of 
these mappings were between the Open Biomedical 
Ontologies (OBO) and Web Ontology Language 
(OWL 1.0) ontologies. Since our technique for 
inconsistency detection has been implemented on top 
of the DRAGO distributed reasoning system, which 
is an OWL-DL based reasoner, we transformed all 
the mapped OBO ontologies into OWL ontologies 
via the OBO-in-OWL Protege plugin. Furthermore, 
the mappings in the BioPortal repository do not use 
“true” 
logical 
equivalence 
(e.g., 
owl: 
equivalentClass), 
but 
rather 
the 
notion 
of 
“similarity”5. Since such a weaker definition of 
equivalence is not modeled in DDL, we transformed 
each “similar” mapping into an equivalence (≡), into 
(⊆), and onto (⊇) bridge rules for experimentation.  
Results 
Table 1 shows the results of our evaluation. From the 
mapping repository, we chose only those mapped 
ontologies which had at least 2 or more mappings 
specified between them. We also did not include 
mappings involving the Foundational Model of 
Anatomy (FMA) and International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD-9) because the current release of 
DRAGO (version 2.1) does not support nominals 
(e.g., owl:oneOf, owl:hasValue constructs) present in 
FMA, and there is no ClaML (Classification Markup 
Language used to represent ICD-9) to OWL 
transformer available, respectively. Furthermore, the 
columns L-Satisfiable and D-Satisfiable in Table 1 
represent the total number of classes found satisfiable 
in the target ontology that are determined by the local 
axioms of the ontology (localized reasoning) and by 
propagation of the axioms via mappings (distributed 
reasoning), respectively. 
Discussion 
Result Analysis. For mappings between OBO 
ontologies, no inconsistencies were found. We 
believe this can be attributed to the fact that none of 
the evaluated OBO ontologies had disjoint class 
axioms, and hence none of the mappings were 
conflicting. Similarly, for mappings between OBO 
and OWL ontologies, no inconsistencies were 
observed even though the two original OWL 
ontologies that were evaluated, Nano Particle 
Ontology (NPO) and NCI-Thesaurus (NCI-T), had 
12,265 and 171 disjoint class axioms, respectively. 
We believe that the lack of mapping inconsistency 
can be attributed to: (i) for many mappings, the 
classes from the disjoint class axioms were not 
involved, and (ii) for those mappings where such 
classes were involved, the mappings were logically 
correct. For example, NPO and ChEBI had the 
mappings 
npo:Gold≡chebi:CHEBI 
29287 
and 
npo:Carbon≡chebi:CHEBI 
27594, 
such 
that 
npo:Gold is disjointWith npo:Carbon, and the classes 
CHEBI 29287 and CHEBI 27594 (with labels gold 
and carbon, respectively) had no associations 
between them. Consequently, there was no conflict in 
the mappings as well. Finally, due to performance 
issues, we were not able to evaluate mappings 
between original OWL ontologies (namely, Galen 
and NCI-T). 
Limitations and Further Work. As mentioned earlier, 
in this work we limited our scope to one-to-one 
concept mappings, and further considered only 
equivalence and subsumption mappings. However, in 
reality, it is possible to specify arbitrary mappings 
e.g., disjoint) between any ontological entities (e.g., 
relationships) and the ability to consider such 
mappings to find inconsistencies becomes vital.

Furthermore, in the current evaluation, we took a 
snapshot of the mapping repository, thereby not 
considering how different versions of an ontology 
will affect the associated mappings. In future, we 
plan to evaluate how mapping consistency and 
satisfiability results vary with the evolution of the 
ontologies. Another limitation of our work is the 
complexity of the reasoning procedure. DDL 
subsumption reasoning has been shown to be 
NEXPTIME7, thereby significantly impacting the 
efficiency of the consistency checking process. For 
example, evaluating the mappings between GALEN 
and NCI-Thesaurus was not feasible as the program 
runs out of memory (with a maximum Java heap 
space of 4GB). Hence, our objective is to leverage 
approximate reasoning services that apply correct but 
incomplete heuristics for performance gain9. 
Complementary to our work, the problem of 
identifying erroneous mappings has been addressed 
using 
the 
notion 
of 
a 
“global 
ontology”10. 
Consequently, reasoning is done with respect to the 
global ontology which, in certain cases, can result in 
increased 
complexity 
compared 
to 
distributed 
reasoning that exploits the structure provided by 
semantic relations for the propagation of reasoning 
through the local ontologies. However, there are no 
studies verifying this hypothesis, and our goal is to 
adapt our approach for such an investigation. Finally, 
our work raises the issue of evaluating “similarity” 
mappings between simple ontologies because, for 
example, in the absence of disjoint class axioms in 
both source and target ontologies, the mappings, 
although logically consistent, may still represent 
incorrect knowledge. We believe this can be partially 
addressed 
by 
leveraging 
the 
subsumption 
propagation of DDL (Figure 2) to create a distributed 
hierarchy which can be evaluated for correctness and 
accuracy, although such a proposal warrants further 
research.

Abstract 
In recent years, bioscience communities centered on 
particular areas of study, or groups of technologies, 
have generated so-called Minimum Information (MI) 
checklists specifying the data and metadata that 
should be captured from the totality of information 
generated in the course of an investigation. In 
parallel, ontologies, formats, data capture tools and 
databases have been developed that can support the 
collection, validation, archiving and sharing of MI 
checklist-compliant data sets. In this paper, we 
discuss our use of the ontologies as facilitators of 
much of the above functionality: to semantically 
enrich data sets both at the point of capture and 
subsequently; as part of a rule-based content 
validation system; and to increase the speed and 
resolution of database queries. 
Introduction 
The general trend to enrich all manner of information 
by attaching machine-readable tags to as much of it 
as possible manifests in many forms: extended 
markup languages; folksonomy-style labels on blog 
entries; ontology terms appended to scientific papers 
e.g.,1,2. In keeping with the trend, some biological 
e.g.,3,4
databases
have 
employed 
terminological 
artifacts of varying degrees of sophistication 
(hereafter commonly referred to as ontologies) to 
support more precisely targeted querying with fewer 
false negatives. 
However, there is a looming logistical issue: once 
funders and journals begin to require that firstly, 
researchers make more of their data public, and 
secondly, that they begin to comply with minimum 
information (MI) checklists5,6,7, experimental data 
will begin to flow into databases at a much greater 
rate and there will not be enough curators to annotate 
it all. The only feasible solution is better annotation 
at source (i.e., by data generators), assisted by some 
form of automated content validation. 
MI checklists, such as MIAME8, MIAPE9 and 
MIGS10, each specify the information that should be 
provided when reporting a particular type of 
biological/biomedical investigation (the examples 
given addressing microarray-, proteomics- and 
genomics-based investigations respectively). By 
requiring a thorough and regularized description of 
an experimental workflow (for example, by requiring 
an explicitly specified set of sample characteristics or 
instrument parameters) MI checklists promote 
transparency and data accessibility, and support more 
thorough quality assessment, increasing the value of 
data set, and by extension the competitiveness of the 
originators and the host database(s). 
However, because these various MI checklists have 
been developed independently, focusing on one 
specific 
technology, 
they 
overlap 
in 
scope. 
Furthermore, arbitrary decisions on wording and 
structure guarantee significant incompatibilities. 
Until recently there were no mechanisms to 
coordinate checklist development. Even attempting to 
establish the range and number of checklists was 
challenging, and tracking their evolution rather 
laborious.  
Nowadays, 
researchers 
are 
able 
to 
perform 
biological/biomedical investigations where the same 
sample is run through the full range of technologies, 
in combination. In this specific case, it is critical that 
the MI checklists and ontologies developed around a 
specific technology or biological/biomedical domain 
are designed to be interoperable and fit neatly into a 
jigsaw, with users being able to take the pieces that 
are relevant to report their investigation. 
Recently, representatives of a number of checklist 
development projects began the MIBBI (Minimum 
Information 
for 
Biological 
and 
Biomedical 
Investigations) project11. MIBBI has two broad goals: 
(i) the Portal, to provide straightforward access to 
checklists and their developers, acting as a ‘one-stop 
shop’ in a manner analogous to the Open Biomedical 
Ontology portal12; (ii) the Foundry, to foster the 
development of new, orthogonal suite of checklist 
modules, just like the OBO Foundry13 does for the 
ontologies.  
These new integrated modules will act as drivers for 
the development of data capture software, exchange

formats, and repositories that can contain the 
information they specify, where none already exists. 
Towards 
Ontology-Aware 
and 
Standards 
Compliant Tools 
An important feature of these new MIBBI modules 
will be their association with mappings that make an 
explicit link between particular line items and (sets 
of) terms in (one or more) ontologies. These 
mappings 
will 
assist 
software 
and 
database 
developers providing the ontology aware, checklist 
supportive data capture tools and repositories that 
will provide the main mechanism for annotating 
standards-compliant data sets using ontology terms. 
Such tools will guide users compiling investigation 
reports; for example, by highlighting those fields 
mandated by the appropriate MIBBI modules, and by 
offering a simple validation mechanism to ensure that 
all those fields contain data of the correct type. 
However, to support ontology-based annotation of 
data sets, a mapping is required that explicitly links 
particular data fields to (parts of) individual 
ontologies. 
When implemented in software, mappings simplify 
the process of finding and using appropriate ontology 
terms for users, and ensure that the terms used in 
across the swathes of reports in repositories of 
research data come from comparable sources. Such 
consistency in annotation is important for supporting 
efficacious querying across sets of reports. 
An ontology-aware data capture tool can also 
perform more sophisticated validation than simply 
checking data types according to an XML Schema 
definition or content according to a series of regular 
expressions14. In essence, ontology-based validation 
uses the MI checklist-to-ontology mapping alongside 
the mapping from the MI checklist to the data format 
(if validation is performed by a standalone tool) or 
database schema with which the data are classified. 
Valid entries contain ontology terms deemed 
‘appropriate’ by the mapping (and by extension, do 
not 
contain 
inappropriate 
terms). 
Of course, 
mappings need to be updated as ontologies grow and 
evolve. 
Conceptual Design and Preliminary Work 
In this section we present our initial work and the 
overall conceptual design for an integrated, ontology 
and standards aware data capture and management 
system, built around MIBBI modules. This work is 
part of the Investigation / Study / Assay (ISA) 
Infrastructure15, a new infrastructure to commonly 
represent, store and serve experimental metadata 
(including experimental design, sample source(s) and 
treatment(s), preparation of a sample for analytical 
assay, the processes and instruments used throughout, 
and 
sample-data 
file 
relations). 
The 
ISA 
infrastructure is based upon ISA-Tab16, a general 
purpose, 
common framework with which to 
communicate 
experimental 
metadata. 
The 
infrastructure includes several open source Java 
software 
components17, 
which 
can 
work 
independently, or as a unified system, including: 
•  ISAcreator, which draws on spreadsheets for its 
look and feel, to capture and edit experimental 
metadata; 
•  ISAconfigurator to manage the ISA-Tab fields 
displayed in ISAcreator; for example, by making 
them mandatory and/or requiring the use of 
ontologies); 
•  The BioInvestigation Index (BII) database for 
storing and querying ISA-Tab formatted metadata 
Figure 
1 
shows 
these 
components, 
their 
interrelations, inputs and outputs.  
Figure 1. A ‘power user’ (top of figure) creates a 
configuration file to match ISA-Tab fields to the 
requirements of the MIBBI modules relevant to a particular 
workflow, tying in a specific set of ontologies along the way. 
ISAcreator then loads the configuration and guides the user 
(bottom left) in describing the experimental metadata for 
submission to the BII database, which can be queried using 
ontology terms. 
Module content is taken from MIBBI and mapped by 
a ‘power user’ (i.e., curator) into ISA-Tab elements 
and one or more external ontologies, using the 
ISAconfigurator. The resulting configuration file is 
then uploaded in ISAcreator and corresponding 
interface components are automatically generated, 
enforcing mandatory fields and/or use of ontology 
terms, searched and selected from OBO Foundry 
ontologies accessed in real time via Ontology 
Lookup Service (OLS)18 and BioPortal19 public 
portals. With the appropriate mappings in place (i.e., 
those that correspond to the MIBBI modules 
appropriate to the particular biological/biomedical

investigation from which the experimental metadata 
is being captured), the ISAcreator tool is ready to be 
distributed to users (i.e., data generators) and used as 
an electronic lab-book.  
The MIBBI mappings in ISAcreator allow the 
interface to guide submitters to supply all required 
MI requirements, and the ontology mappings will 
assist them in semantically enriching the description 
of 
the 
experimental 
metadata 
(N.B., 
adding 
ontological annotations to a data set is not normally a 
requirement made by funders or journals, so the 
process needs to be as efficient and painless as 
possible for users). 
On request, a validation routine checks not only for a 
syntactically valid document (i.e., all the right data 
types in all the right places), but also, to a limited 
degree, for a semantically valid document. It is hoped 
that this double mechanism will assist data generators 
in compiling submissions that require little further 
attention from database curators, most of the gross 
errors having been caught.  
Upon completion of a syntactically and semantically 
valid investigation report, ISAcreator then outputs 
the experimental metadata as an ISA-Tab file along 
with the associated data files in a compressed 
‘ISArchive’, ready for upload to the BII database20 or 
any other system that imports ISA-Tab files. Once 
the investigation is loaded in the database, ontology 
terms then serve a second, more familiar role as 
searchable tags on the experimental metadata. This 
allows precise queries to be formulated with some 
confidence that in most cases a search for a spade 
will find all manner of large digging implements, 
rather than falling foul of the usual quasispecies of 
variously-typo-ridden variants. 
Conclusions 
Two inexorable trends – to submit richly annotated 
biological/biomedical investigations, and to submit 
them in greater numbers – present software and 
database developers with a significant challenge: 
given that database curators are not able to manually 
check and reannotate the many complex submissions 
to come, greater automation of various processes is 
required. 
Although some ontology-aware tools exist 21, 22, more 
sophisticated solutions such as ISAcreator are needed 
that implement mappings from reporting MI 
guidelines to data formats and ontologies, reducing 
the error load of new submissions to databases. The 
ontology terms that were so useful for compiling and 
validating files (either by the submitter on 
completion, or by the curator on receipt) then become 
useful in the database setting in their traditional role 
– as hooks with which to retrieve data.

Abstract 
Formal ontologies have made significant impact in 
bioscience over the last ten years. Among them, the 
Foundational Model of Anatomy Ontology (FMA) is the 
most comprehensive model for the spatio-structural 
representation of human anatomy. In the research 
project MEDICO we use the FMA as our main source of 
background knowledge about human anatomy. Our 
ultimate goals are to use spatial knowledge from the 
FMA (1) to improve automatic parsing algorithms for 
3D 
volume 
data 
sets 
generated 
by 
Computed 
Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and (2) 
to generate semantic annotations using the concepts 
from the FMA to allow semantic search on medical 
image repositories. We argue that in this context more 
spatial relation instances are needed than those 
currently available in the FMA. In this publication we 
present a technique for the automatic inductive 
acquisition of spatial relation instances by generalizing 
from expert-annotated volume datasets.  
Introduction 
Semantic medical image search as approached by 
Advances in medical imaging have greatly increased 
the amount of images produced in clinical facilities. 
At the same time, modern hospital information 
systems have also become more complex. Today's 
clinical 
facilities 
typically 
contain 
hospital 
information systems (HIS) for storing patient billing 
and accounting information, radiological information 
systems (RIS) for storing radiological reports, and 
picture archiving and control systems (PACS) for 
archiving medical images.  
It has become challenging for clinicians to query and 
retrieve relevant previous patient data due to the 
volume 
of 
information, 
the 
complexity 
and 
heterogeneous nature of today’s information systems. 
In particular, former patient images are useful for 
analyzing images of a current examination since they 
help in understanding any progression of pathologies 
or development of recent abnormalities, e.g.,  in the 
context of lymphoma. 
The research project MEDICO1 aims to fuse  
techniques for automatic image segmentation and 
text annotation with semantic web techniques. The 
goal is to allow cross-lingual and modality-
independent search and retrieval across medical 
images, clinical findings and reports. This requires 
processes for automatic annotation of images and 
documents with concepts from formal ontologies to 
allow retrieval to be performed on an abstract level. 
Thus, searching becomes independent of the concrete 
data representation and can leverage on the 
information modeled in formal ontologies, e.g., for 
query expansion as described in a recent ESWC 
publication2. 
Medical imaging equipment nowadays generates 
huge amounts of data either as 2D images (e.g., X-
ray) or 3D volumes which are stacks of 2D image 
slices generated by techniques such as Computed 
Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI). Many approaches for medical image parsing 
already incorporate information on the spatial 
distribution of anatomical entities in the human body 
during the automatic detection. But with only a few 
exceptions this background knowledge is a fixed part 
of the source code of the algorithms, e.g., by using 
statistical distribution functions. Thus, the whole 
application has to be recompiled in order to alter or 
extend this knowledge. 
On the other hand knowledge about human anatomy 
has already been modeled in formal ontologies which 
represent computable artifacts. In MEDICO we use 
the Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology 
(FMA)3 as the main source for knowledge about 
human 
anatomy. 
It 
includes 
a 
well-founded 
formalism for expressing qualitative spatial relations. 
In this context we evaluated the existing spatial 
relation instances in the FMA. Throughout this 
document, we consider a “spatial relation” to be the 
modeling of the relation. In contrast, we use the term 
“spatial relation instance” to refer to the relation 
between two anatomical concepts. Thus, spatial 
relation instances denote relations on the class level. 
By looking more closely on the FMA we found that 
the overall number of spatial relation instances as 
well as the coverage of different body regions and 
biological systems is very limited. We present 
methods to add and evaluate missing spatial relation

Related Work 
MEDICO is based on established Semantic Web 
standards such as OWL4 and RDF5. The MEDICO 
Ontology Hierarchy6 was designed with the rationale 
to reuse or adapt existing ontologies instead of 
creating them from scratch. We build on an existing 
OWL translation of the FMA7 as the primary source 
of anatomical knowledge.  
The recent research publications in the area of 
medical image parsing indicate a strong tendency to 
store 
spatial 
relation 
instances 
as 
statistical 
distributions functions. Here, Gaussian or Bayesian 
models are often used.8 A recent study presented a 
fast and robust approach for full-body organ 
segmentation.9 This approach detects organs by 
taking into account nearby anatomical landmarks to 
improve precision. 
Hybrid approaches for automatic ontology-based 
image segmentation and semantic annotation have 
been presented before. Another system for semantic 
annotation of brain MRI images was presented.10 
Recently, Hudelot et al. have published an ontology 
for the representation of fuzzy spatial relations.11 
This work could be used as a future extension of our 
approach as soon as 3D volumes of organs are 
available instead of the 3D points which we 
currently use. 
To our knowledge an approach for the automatic 
acquisition of spatial relations instances at large 
numbers is still missing. 
Approach and Applied Methods 
We started with a review of the spatial relation 
instances available in the current FMA (version 2.0). 
This revealed that their number is very limited. We 
counted 
1153 
instances 
of 
the 
attributed 
continuous with relation which contain directional 
information between pairs of anatomical entities. 
Natasha Noy (who provided the translation of the 
FMA to OWL on which we base our work) pointed 
out in an email from 2008-11-10 that there is more 
spatial relation information available via properties 
such as contains and tributary of, but –as a 
matter of fact –those lack directional information. 
We also applied an automatic approach which 
checked all available spatial relation instances for 
consistency. With “consistency” we mean, for 
example, that if concept A is on the left side of 
concept B, we would expect the latter (concept B) to 
be on the right side of concept A. However, we found 
that this was not always true. We checked this 
together with the FMA authors who confirmed and 
corrected these inconsistencies. 
The annotated volume data sets available for our tests 
contained points in 3D annotated with keywords. The 
annotated volume data sets available to us contained 
points without any spatial extension representing 
highest/lowest points of anatomical entities such as at 
vertebrae of the spine. To represent them we 
extended the FMA with classes representing these 
points. In total we added 253 classes. We also added 
subClassOf and regional_part_of assertions to 
integrate them with the existing FMA structure. Fig. 
1 gives a systematic overview of the workflow 
applied to acquire new spatial relations instances. 
(1) Basically, the workflow allows arbitrary input 
formats. The only requirement is that they contain 
points in 3D marked with landmarks which are found 
at this position. From our partners in the MEDICO 
consortium we received landmark annotations in 
XML and plain text formats. Thus, the first step was 
to implement converters which map the proprietary 
input formats to a common representation of points 
in 3D and links to concepts in the FMA. 
(2) To generate the spatial relations among these 
landmarks in the format of the FMA we had to 
perform two steps: (a) Calculate the difference 
vectors between all pairs of landmarks and (b) map 
them to directions as they are modeled in the FMA 
(e.g., 
Left, 
Right, 
Superior). All 
landmark 
coordinates were given in millimeters. Consequently, 
we did not have to account for different slice 
spacings of the image volumes. Note that in this step 
the distance information is discarded. Although 
useful for some applications, this information varies

from patient to patient. For instance, it depends on 
the patient's individual size and if the stomach is full 
or empty. Since our aim is to extract features which 
are common for all humans, we reduced the 
difference vectors to their direction with the 
assumption that at least the direction of the vectors 
should generalize well for all humans. The evaluation 
results in give evidence for the correctness of this 
assumption. After this step the spatial relation 
instances were available in tuples of the form 
[concept A] [direction] [concept B]. 
(3) To obtain a set of generic spatial relation 
instances – our model – we compared the data of 
different volume data sets from different patients. 
Next, we systematically eliminated contradictory 
tuples. The quality of the resulting model was 
evaluated using cross validation. 
(4) The model was serialized in OWL format, added 
to our local copy of the FMA and is subsequently 
available for spatial reasoning. In total we were able 
to generate about 13,500 spatial relation instances. 
Evaluation 
For our evaluation we had 30 different volume data 
sets available with 145 different landmarks annotated 
on average. These volumes belong to 29 different 
patients. At first glance this number might seem low; 
but in fact this corpus required the localization of 
more than 4000 landmarks in 30 volume data sets 
which consist of several thousand single images.  
Our learning algorithm had two parameters which 
had 
influence 
on 
the 
generated 
model: 
minFrequency determines in how many of the 
training examples the spatial relation has to occur 
before it is considered as stable and thus part of the 
inferred generic model. For example: For fix X and Y 
the spatial relation instance [X] [Left] [Y] only 
occurs in less than 20 percent of the training 
examples. Here we take low numbers for low 
evidence for this relation and thus do not take it into 
the model. minConfidence determines which fraction 
of each pair of source and destination concepts has to 
share the same direction before the pair and its 
predominant direction are added to the inferred 
model. This rule is applied when the training corpus 
contains contradictory spatial relation instances. To 
give an example: For the concepts [X] and [Y] there 
are two distinct classes of tuples in the training 
corpus: [X] [Left] [Y] and [X] [Inferior] [Y]. 
In general, we do not add any of the tuples to the 
model at all since they are inconsistent. But if more 
For the future we plan to enable our learning 
approach to make use of implicit transitive spatial 
than minConfidence of all tuples belong to the same 
class, we still add a representative of this class, 
taking their distribution as support for their 
universality.

Figure 2. Relation between coverage/error/minConfidence 
We performed a 4-fold cross validation on our corpus 
to evaluate the influence of the parameters discussed 
above. The results are visualized in Fig. 2. The curve 
shows the typical trade-off between recall and 
precision: the more spatial relations of the training 
models we included (coverage) the higher the error 
gets. 
Our 
evaluation 
also 
shows 
that 
the 
minConfidence parameter had a big influence both 
on coverage and error rate in the resulting model. 
The impact of the parameter minFrequency was 
comparable. Based on the dataset available to us we 
were able to generate approximately 13,500 spatial 
relation instances. This covers 85% of all spatial 
tuples appearing in the training volumes with an error 
rate in the test corpus of only 0.87%. 
Conclusion and Future Work 
The research project MEDICO aims to improve 
pixel-based medical image and volume data set 
segmentation 
algorithms 
by 
fusing 
existing 
techniques with formal knowledge about anatomy 
from ontologies. Based on the limited number of 
spatial relation instances in the FMA we have argued 
that there is a need for techniques which acquire 
additional knowledge about the spatial distribution of 
anatomical entities in human bodies. 
We presented our automatic inductive approach 
which infers a set of spatial relation instances from 
manually annotated volume data sets. Our evaluation 
results show that this method is able to provide 
reasonable numbers of additional spatial relation 
instances with error rates below 1 percent.

learned model using far less spatial relation instances.

We also plan to extend our corpus of annotated 
volume data sets. With a spatial model which is 
justified by a larger base of expert annotations we 
plan to investigate its suitability for high-level 
reasoning about potential diseases. Given a stable 
model of spatial relations already exists it could be 
used to detect differences to the spatial relation 
instances of a particular patient. 
These differences could then be used to automatically 
produce 
hints 
about 
enlargements 
of 
certain 
anatomical entities which could be pathological.

An Exercise on Developing an Ontology-Epistemology 
about Schizophrenia and Neuroanatomy

Abstract 
This 
paper 
describes 
preliminary 
ideas 
on 
formalizing some concepts of neuroanatomy in 
ontological and epistemological terms. We envisage 
the application of this ontology to the assimilation of 
facts about medical knowledge about neuroimages 
deriving from schizophrenic patients. 
Introduction 
This paper is part of a major effort towards the 
formalization of the knowledge contained in 
neuroimages of patients with schizophrenia. Our long 
term goal is to build an ontology that is a formal 
basis for the expectations generated from statistical 
data analysis. 
There are a number of biomedical ontologies; 
perhaps central to this area are the Foundational 
Model of Anatomy (FMA)6 and the Open Biomedical 
Ontologies (OBO)9, amongst others as summarized in 
by Friedman, Chen and Fuller, et al3. FMA is a 
knowledge source of classes and relations about 
observable characteristics of the human body 
structure; thus, FMA is mainly concerned with 
representing anatomical information. In contrast, the 
OBO Foundry project is a collaborative development 
which includes a large amount of biological 
information. Some attempts have also been made to 
build ontologies of neuroanatomical structures.4,5 
The goal of the present paper is to relate a spatial 
ontology about the ventricular brain system (VBS) 
with findings about changes in this structure that are 
picked out in neuroimages from schizophrenic 
patients. 
The structure of the VBS can evidently be 
represented within an ontology, however changes in 
neuroimages refer to knowledge about a domain, and 
not to the domain itself; findings about schizophrenia 
falls within the epistemology umbrella. A complete 
solution of combining ontologies with epistemology 
is still an open issue. However, we make explicit 
which are the classes related to the domain of 
neuroanatomy and which are related to the 
knowledge about the domain (the epistemological 
classes). In the present paper we propose a region-
based ontology using the Basic Inclusion Theory 
(BIT)1, due to its clear definitions of spatial regions 
through part-whole, taxonomic and topological 
relations, with the explicit use of logical relations. 
Another characteristic of BIT is that its underlying 
language is the first-order logic, which allows the 
inclusion of axioms about complementary theories 
into a single formalism. Figure 1 presents BIT base 
relations. 
Figure 1. Basic Inclusion Theory relations. 
Ventricular Brain System (VBS) 
The ventricular brain system is a cavity disposed 
within the brain, which is composed of the third, 
fourth and lateral ventricles. The lateral ventricles are 
subdivided as body, frontal horn, occipital horn and 
temporal horn. The communication between the 
lateral ventricles and the third ventricle is done by the 
Monro foramina. The third ventricle is sub-divided 
into 
anterior 
commissure, 
optical 
recess, 
supraparienal 
recess 
and 
infundibulum 
and 
communicates with lateral ventricles by Monro 
foramina. The third ventricle also communicates with 
the fourth ventricle by the cerebral aqueduct and in 
the centre of the third ventricle is located the 
interthalamic connection. The fourth ventricle is 
composed by the lateral recess and the Luschka 
foramina linking up with the third ventricle through 
the brain aqueduct. 
A Spatial Bio-Ontology for VBS 
To represent the ventricular brain system and the 
medical knowledge about schizophrenia, we define 
Fiat Boundaries11,10 and a notion of continuity8,11 using 
BIT relations. The next section presents some ideas 
about how it is accomplished.

Fiat Boundaries and Continuity 
Fiat boundaries are used for representing abstract 
limits, i.e., those limits that are commonly accepted, 
but which do not have a concrete existence11,10. In the 
biomedical area fiat boundaries can be used to 
delimit anatomical regions2, such as the limits 
between ventricular regions. We define the relation 
LFiat, read as “x is a fiat boundary in y”, and is 
axiomatised as follows: 
LFiat(x, y)  
(1) 
LFiat(z, x) → PCoin(z, x) 
(2) 
LFiat(x, y) → ¬∃z LFiat(z, x) 
(3) 
LFiat(x, y) ∧ LFiat(x, z) → ¬Desc(y, z) 
(4) 
LFiat(x, y) ∧ LFiat(y, z) → PCoin(x, y) 
(5) 
A discontinuity can be deﬁned as a disjunction 
among two distinct spatial regions which became 
disconnected. Santos e Cabalar8 proposed a theory 
based to represent discontinuity based in Varzi11. We 
use this notion to represent (for instance) the third 
ventricle, which has a material discontinuity called 
the interthalamic connection. We represent a 
discontinuity using the relation Disc(x,y) (“x is a 
discontinuity in y”) and deﬁne the following axioms 
to constrain its meaning: 
Disc(x, y) 
(6) 
Disc(x, y) → LocIn(x, y) 
(7) 
Disc(x, y) → ¬Disc(y, z) 
(8) 
Using Desc/2 we can deﬁne the notion of 
“continuous part”: PCont(x, y) meaning that x is a 
continuous part of y, as shown in formula 9. 
PCont(x, y) ≡ [PP (x, y) ∨ P(x, y)] ∧ 
∀z ¬Disc(z, x) 
(9) 
Then, we deﬁne a segment x 
of 
an 
object 
y 
(Segm(x,y)) as the “maximal continuous part” of y 
according to formula 10. 
Segm(x, y) ≡ PCont(x, y) ∧ ¬∃z[PP (y, z) ∧ 
PCont(z, y)]
 (10) 
Representing the VBS 
There are 21 Fiat boundaries limiting all ventricular 
anatomical elements. The formulas 11 to 14 represent 
the fiat boundaries (represented by Z) that delimit the 
right and left lateral ventricles, third ventricle and 
fourth ventricle. 
LFiat(Z1;Left_Lateral_Ventricle) 
(11) 
LFiat(Z2;Right_Lateral_Ventricle)
 (12) 
LFiat(Z3;Third_Ventricle) 
(13) 
LFiat(Z4;Fourth_Ventricle) 
(14) 
Given the deﬁnitions of Fiat boundaries and 
continuity, we have conditions to represent each 
ventricle individually without ambiguities. The 
foramina area is deﬁned in similar terms. The 
formulas 15 define the right lateral ventricle, the 
volume of ventricle is given by variable φ. In the 
similar way the formulas 16 to 18 define the third left 
lateral ventricle, third ventricle and fourth ventricle, 
respectively: 
Inst(x,Right_Lateral_Vent) ← (Vol(x) = φ) ∧ 
[φ > Vol_TV] ∧ [φ > Vol_FV] ∧ LFiat(Z2,x) ∧ 
Segm(x,Ventricular_Brain_System) 
(15) 
Inst(x,Left_Lateral_Ventricle) ← (Vol(x) = φ) ∧ 
[φ > Vol_TV] ∧ [φ > Vol_FV] ∧ LFiat(Z1, x) ∧ 
Segm(x, Ventricular_Brain_System ) 
(16) 
Inst(x,Third_Ventricle)←(Vol(x)=φ)∧[(φ<Vol_LLV) 
∧ (φ<Vol_RLV)] ∧(φ>Vol_FV) ∧ LFiat(Z3,x) ∧ 
Segm(x,Ventricular_Brain_System) 
(17) 
Inst(x,Fourth_Ventricle) 
← 
(Vol(x) 
= 
φ) 
∧ 
[(φ<Vol_LLV)∧(φ<Vol_RLV)]∧(φ<Vol_TV) 
∧ 
LFiat(Z4,x)∧Segm(x, Ventricular_Brain_System)(18) 
We include in Protégé all axioms that represent the 
Fiat boundaries and which anatomical structures they 
are related to. This deﬁnition is expressive enough to 
answer questions such as: “given one region x, that 
belongs to y, which is this region?”, or “which 
ventricular region is the foramina x connected with 
the ventricles?”. 
Epistemological Classes 
In order to deﬁne common characteristics among 
distinct groups, the medical specialist relies on the 
relative literature (using information from meta­
analysis), 
image 
or 
statistical 
analysis. 
The 
information available in these sources is not part of 
the domain (so it cannot be captured by an ontology) 
but it is knowledge about it. 
The knowledge about things are not the things itself, 
therefore, including it in the ontology would lead to 
Kantian confusion. In this work we avoid this 
confusion by assuming “epistemological classes”, 
which are related to the ontological classes by a 
modiﬁed Is_a 
relation 
(Is_a2). 
Given 
an 
epistemological class E, an ontological class O and a 
binary primitive relation κ(x, y) (representing that x 
is the knowledge about a domain y), we deﬁne Is_a2 
in BIT in the following way:   
Is_a2(E,O)≡∀x(Inst(x,E)→¬Inst(x,O)∧κ(x,O)  (19) 
108

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
       
 
        
 
        
 
       
 
     
 
          
 
   
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
   
 
Informally, E is an epistemological class within the 
ontology O iff every instance of E is not an instance 
of O but is knowledge about O. In Figure 2 we can 
see a graphical schema that shows epistemological 
classes about the right lateral ventricle. The 
epistemological classes are described by the formulas 
20 to 27. 
Figure 2. 
Differences about Ontological and Epistemological domains. 
Is_a2(CONTROL_RIGHT_LV,RIGHT_LV) 
(20) 
Is_a2(PATIENT_RIGHT_LV,RIGHT_LV) 
(21) 
Is_a2(CONTROL_LEFT_LV,LEFT_LV) 
(22) 
Is_a2(PATIENT_LEFT_LV,LEFT_LV) 
(23) 
Is_a2(CONTROL_TV,THIRD_VENTRICLE) 
(24) 
Is_a2(PATIENT_TV,THIRD_VENTRICLE) 
(25) 
Is_a2(CONTROL_FV,FOURTH_VENTRICLE) (26) 
Is_a2(PATIENT_FV,FOURTH_VENTRICLE) 
(27) 
Therefore, we can include both ontological and 
epistemological individuals in the same formalism. In 
this work, an epistemological individual is a piece of 
knowledge about anatomical changes in the VBM 
(related to schizophrenia) that comes from the 
medical literature (meta analysis for instance) or from 
image data analysis procedures. It is now possible to 
execute queries about, for instance, the composition 
of the ventricular brain system, or about specialist 
knowledge about the domain. 
An example of an ontological query is: “Which 
structures compose the ventricular brain system?” 
This query in Protégé (using Manchester syntax) 
becomes “PP only Ventricular_Brain_System” and 
results in all classes that compose the ventricular 
brain system. Figure 3 shows us a part of some of 
these results.  
Figure 3. Ontological Query Result 
Epistemological reasoning is possible in a similar 
way: the query “the volume 6.52 of the right or left 
lateral ventricles is classiﬁed as patient or control 
groups?”. 
In 
Protégé 
this 
query 
becomes 
“Lateral_Ventricles and Vol value 6.52”, and 
produces the result: “Vol_Right_LV_Control_Barr”, 
which means that the classification of an individual 
whose lateral ventricle (LV) has a volume of 6.52 is 
“control” according to Barr 7. 
Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper briefly described a formalization for 
ontological and epistemological classes about the 
ventricular brain system defined using BIT, and 
realized computationally in Protégé. This allows us to 
include and consult the domain entities as well as the 
knowledge about the domain. Future work will 
consider the formalization of new evidences about 
schizophrenia to be included in this framework.

Towards an Ontology of Biomedical Educational Objectives 
Martin Boeker, Holger Stenzhorn, Felix Balzer, Stefan Schulz

Abstract 
The 
domain 
of 
medical 
education 
combines 
educational objectives and cognitive functions with 
the subject-matter of organism structures, functions 
and malfunctions as well as diagnostic and 
interventional techniques.  
A re-structuring of learning objectives guided by 
principles of ontology seems promising as this gives 
the means to compare, classify, and validate learning 
objectives using formal methods.  
Although large parts of the subject-matter of medical 
education are already covered by existing biomedical 
vocabularies, there still exist several challenges for 
designing an ontology of educational objectives. 
Emphasis is given to the representation of plans and 
cognitive entities on the one hand, and on 
prototypical “blueprint” entities on the other. 
Introduction 
A high-quality education of undergraduate and 
graduate students as future health professionals is a 
cornerstone for the sustained delivery of high quality 
and effective health services. Formalization and 
standardization of educational content can be an 
important means to reduce the complexity and 
inconsistency in this highly dynamic field with its 
rapidly emerging and evolving contents. 
Educational objectives are the core of every 
proficient teaching and learning assessment process1. 
For over 50 years educational objectives have served 
as “explicit formulations of the ways in which 
students are expected to be changed by the educative 
process”2. Given this important function, in medical 
education, a large number of educational objectives 
have been collected in catalogues, either on a central 
basis for a group of medical schools3 or on a local 
basis for single institutions.  
Despite the laborious effort to compile large bodies 
of educational objectives, the targeted audience – 
teachers, learners and curriculum developers – has 
had limited benefit. It is difficult to access the 
tremendous amount of educational objectives in a 
certain subject-matter in any practical way: Subject-
matters in a medical curriculum are as diverse as the 
expected knowledge and skills of the future 
professionals, covering the whole range of pre-
clinical and clinical disciplines. Curriculum content 
also includes teaching-related factors such as contact 
hours or specific learning aids. 
Up to now, learning objectives have been published 
in narrative form without any reference to 
standardized terminologies. As a consequence, their 
content is subject to different interpretations. Further, 
their arrangement in hierarchies is intuitive but 
informal, e.g., the Taxonomy of Educational 
Objectives4. As a result, in current practice, the 
sequence, consistency and coherence of the complex 
structure of a compilation of learning objectives 
within a curriculum can neither be exhaustively 
checked nor displayed in a principled fashion.  
This is the reason why we propose to follow 
principles of formal ontology for the representation 
of learning objectives. This Ontology of Biomedical 
Educational Objectives (OBEO) is intended to 
support tools for annotation, consistency checking, 
and 
navigation 
within 
educational 
objective 
catalogues. We propose to align this ontology with 
an upper-level ontology, like DOLCE5, and also link 
it to established biomedical terminologies and 
ontologies. Here, SNOMED CT6 would be the first 
choice due to its high coverage of the clinical domain 
and being an accepted standard resource. For the 
basic biomedical sciences, several OBO Foundry 
ontologies7 would constitute a useful completion as 
the most prominent ontological source in this 
domain.   
The Function and Structure of Learning Objectives 
The formulation of educational objectives plays a 
central role in the development of a medical 
curriculum by addressing the needs of the learners8. 
The importance of educational objectives becomes 
obvious in the scope of their different roles in the 
educational process1. 
Educational objectives provide 
• 
focus for instruction, 
• 
guidelines for learning, 
• 
targets for formative and summative assessment, 
• 
instructional intent to others, and 
• 
possibilities for instruction evaluation. 
Today, educational objectives are usually placed as 
intended learning outcomes at the final stage of an 
instruction process which allows assessing the 
111

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
students’ performance after the learning process. 
Defined in such a way, educational objectives 
represent clearly what is expected from the students 
after the training, e.g., through demonstrating 
knowledge, 
performance 
in 
psycho-motor 
or 
communication skills, or even in the complex 
behavior associated with certain attitudes. 
Educational objectives in a medical curriculum are 
typically formulated as follows:  
•  
The physician is able to assess a patient 
presenting this problem [from a list of given 
medical problems] in a well-structured way, and 
to establish a differential diagnosis. 
•  
She/he 
is 
able 
to 
propose 
appropriate 
diagnostic, therapeutic, social, preventive and 
other 
measures, 
and 
to 
provide 
urgent 
intervention 
in 
case 
of 
life-threatening 
problems.3 
This learning objective states who will do how much 
(or how well) of what. Thus a learning objective 
statement comprises an agent (usually the learner) 
who performs a certain action which indicates a 
defined performance level to proof his or her 
acquired knowledge, skills, or attitude towards some 
given subject. 
Using the BioTop domain upper-level ontology 
together with the DOLCE upper-level ontology5 and 
the OBO Relation Ontology9, we can express a 
learning objective as a goal represented by a 
biotop:immaterial-nonphysical-entitya and which is 
part of some biotop:plan. Since many different things 
can constitute an obeo:learning-objective in one 
context but not in another one, we express this by 
introducing the obeo:learning-objective-role. The 
learner is an instance of biotop:human who is 
ro:agentIn in a biotop:action, as defined in the 
obeo:learning-objective and in whom it is internally 
represented. For the existence of an obeo:learning­
object, the biotop:action does not need to be 
instantiated but it can be only obeo:realized-by the 
specified biotop:action (cf. Fig. 1). 
Complex relations exist between the type of action to 
be performed by the learner and the type of subject. 
E.g., there are subtypes of biotop:action for the 
cognitive domain, such as 
obeo:remembering, 
obeo:understanding, obeo:applying, obeo:analyzing, 
a biotop identifies classes and relations from BioTop, obeo classes 
and relations from the Ontology of Educational Objectives 
(OBEO), dol classes and relations from DOLCE, snomed concepts 
from SNOMED CT and ro relations from the OBO Relation 
Ontology. 
obeo:evaluating, or obeo:creating. This can be 
represented as a hierarchy of cognitive actions2, 4. 
To broaden the view on educational objectives as 
intended learning outcomes, a list of possible 
learning outcomes is given according to10: 
•  
reactions to learning, 
•  
modification of attitudes and perceptions, 
•  
acquisition of knowledge and skills, 
•  
behavioral changes, 
•  
changes in organizational practice, and 
•  
benefits to patients. 
In this context, educational objectives can be defined 
more generally in terms of professional conduct or 
competencies a health care professional should 
exhibit, as well as more specific tasks a physician is 
expected to perform in respect to the medical 
domain. 
Reference to the Subject-Matter in the Definition 
of Educational Objectives  
The large body of educational objectives in medicine 
is related to well-defined medical topics as those 
covered by a broad range of biomedical vocabularies.  
Therefore, an educational objectives ontology will 
have to include or to refer to existing terminological 
and ontological sources in order to cover the subject-
matter of the domain knowledge and skills to be 
demonstrated or performed. Important features for 
the definition of specific medical educational 
objectives 
are 
anatomical 
and 
biomolecular 
structures, 
etiology, 
epidemiology, 
clinic, 
and 
diagnostic features of diseases, clinical pathways, 
diagnostic and interventional techniques, etc.  
Although most of this content is already covered by 
current biomedical ontologies, terminologies, and 
classification systems, e.g., SNOMED CT, ICD, 
OBO, their inclusion into the definition of learning 
objectives leads to new ontological challenges, as 
there are major differences between the standard 
usage of domain ontologies and their usage in the 
context of describing learning objectives: 
•  In the standard approach, ontology classes are 
instantiated by particular objects or processes 
that have a concrete spatiotemporal existence. 
For example, the rationale of having a class 
snomed:influenza in a clinical ontology is to 
describe what is universally true for all instances 
of this class and what, consequently, can be 
asserted for each individual influenza that 
instantiates this class.  
112

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Figure 1: Displayed is a part of a complex obeo:influenza-learning-object which can be instantiated only by a biotop:action with several 
biotop:qualities and the biotop:role obeo:learning-objective-role. Biomedical concepts are linked via oboe:blueprint classes which are abstractions of 
concrete medical entities referred by standard terminologies/ ontologies. Blueprints can be tailored to the specific needs in the learning-objective, 
e.g., by the extension of a subset of the subclasses. 
•  But if influenza is referred to in an educational 
scenario, the focus is, on the contrary, to convey 
what is typically true for an influenza. So, 
instead of referring to concrete instances of 
influenza of concrete patients, the reference to 
snomed:influenza in an educational scenario 
targets a kind of “blueprint” of this disease, but 
not a class of really existing influenza instances. 
•  Such representational objects (blueprints of 
anatomical structures but also of disease courses, 
clinical protocols, etc.) can be tailored on a broad 
scale to the learning objectives and specific 
needs of the learners, thus existing on several 
levels of abstraction. For instance, a “heart­
blueprint” for a gross anatomy course in a 
medical school will include the ramifications of 
the heart’s electrical conduct system. But this is 
probably not the case in an introductory course 
on human biology at high school level. This, 
again, might be very different from the heart as a 
topic of pathological anatomy where it is likely 
to include the different congenital defects, as 
taught, e.g., in a course for pediatric nurses.  
The general problem is to ascertain the ontological 
nature of blueprint objects and to formally relate 
them to classes in biomedical ontologies. In BioTop, 
blueprint objects are best classified under the type 
biotop:immaterial-nonphysical-entity which in turn is a 
subclass 
of 
DOLCE’s 
dol:non-physical-object 
(formerly known as dol:description). Although not 
explicitly provided for neither by BioTop nor by 
DOLCE, we propose to relate blueprints to the 
related classes by the relation obeo:realized-by For 
example, we state that a obeo:influenza-blueprint is a 
obeo:blueprint that can only be realized by some 
instance of snomed:influenza. In OWL Manchester 
Syntax notation11: 
 obeo:influenza-blueprint equivalent-to 
obeo:blueprint and 
oboe:realized-by only snomed:influenza 
Although not very relevant in an educational context, 
it should be noted that a blueprint object can exist 
113

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
without ever being realized. This may be the case of 
a new therapeutic protocol, or the structure formula 
of a drug that has not yet been synthesized.  
Classes like obeo:influenza-blueprint can be further 
specialized in terms of different ways of description, 
e.g., graphic, textual, etc., or different granularities as 
deemed adequate for each group of learners. 
In any case we have to reject naïve models such as  
oboe:learning-objective-I implies 
includes some snomed:influenza (…) 
This states that for each oboe:learning-objective-I at 
least one instance of snomed:influenza exists. But the 
educational objective certainly has not any specific 
relation to any particular disease instance of a 
particular person. 
Conclusion 
Summing up, the reference to biomedical ontologies 
in the context of creating an ontology for learning 
objectives requires new modeling patterns, because it 
is always the (prototypical) description of some type 
of domain entities which has to be represented in a 
biomedical 
ontology. 
In 
contrast 
to 
clinical 
ontologies, where process, procedure, or disease 
types are instantiated by particular patients with their 
particular diseases, operations, signs, symptoms and 
diagnostic parameters, these (particular) things are 
not of interest in an ontology of educational 
objectives. This motivates the introduction of a new 
type of entity, a kind of prototypical description we 
have termed “blueprint”. Blueprint entities have not 
been subject to current biomedical ontologies, 
although some of them – above all the Foundational 
Model of Anatomy – show a clear (however not 
explicit) tendency toward this kind of representation.  
As a second but equally important conclusion of this 
paper we emphasize the need to ontologically 
redesign 
the 
existing 
informal 
catalogs 
and 
taxonomies which are currently being used in 
medical education.

An Ontology-Based Framework for Clinical Research Databases

Abstract 
The Ontology-Based eXtensible data model (OBX) 
was developed to serve as a framework for the 
development of a clinical research database in the 
Immunology 
Database 
and 
Analysis 
Portal 
(ImmPort) system. OBX was designed around the 
logical structure provided by the Basic Formal 
Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for Biomedical 
Investigations (OBI). By using the logical structure 
provided by these two well-formulated ontologies, we 
have found that a relatively simple, extensible data 
model could be developed to represent the relatively 
complex domain of clinical research. In addition, the 
common framework provided by the BFO should 
make it straightforward to utilize OBX database data 
dictionaries based on reference and application 
ontologies from the OBO Foundry. 
Overview 
The U.S. National Institutes of Health are interested 
in maximizing the return on the public investment in 
biomedical research. This had led many institutes to 
develop policies that encourage sharing of data 
generated from research supported by this public 
funding. In this regard, the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) has 
supported a number of bioinformatics initiatives to 
provide the infrastructure to capture and manage 
research data for re-use and re-analysis. The 
Bioinformatics Integration Support Contract (BISC) 
was awarded to develop a long-term sustainable 
archive of data generated by the ~1500 investigators 
supported by the Division of Allergy, Immunology 
and Transplantation (DAIT). DAIT investigators 
conduct a wide range of research program types, 
including basic scientific research of immune system 
function, translational research to determine the 
underlying mechanisms of immune system disease 
and response to infection, and clinical trials to 
evaluate the safety, toxicity, efficacy and mechanisms 
of immune disease therapies and vaccination 
strategies. We have developed the Immunology 
Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort) to support 
not only the archiving of these valuable data sets, but 
also to support their integration with the biological 
knowledge contained in other public data repositories 
(e.g. GenBank, UniProt, the Immune Epitope 
Database, the Protein Data Bank, etc.) and their 
analysis using state-of-the-art data mining analytical 
tools (www.immport.org). 
One of the biggest challenges in ImmPort design is 
how best to manage the data derived from the wide 
range of different experiment methodologies being 
used by DAIT-funded investigators, which includes 
everything 
from 
gene 
expression 
and 
SNP 
genotyping microarrays up through clinical trials, and 
methodologies that are somewhat unique to the 
immunology research domain (e.g. flow cytometry 
and ELISPOT). And so we have adopted a general 
strategy for database development in which our 
database structure is designed around the general 
features of any biomedical investigation, rather than 
based on experimental details that might be 
methodology specific.  
In addition to this design constraint, ImmPort would 
also like to ensure that our data and analytical 
infrastructure is maximally interoperable with other 
external databases and bioinformatics resources. 
Thus ImmPort has been an active participant and 
early adopter of many data standards development 
initiatives, including the development of minimum 
data standards like MIFlowCyt1 through the MIBBI 
consortium2 
and ontology standards like the 
Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) 
through the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) 
Foundry consortium3. 
Through this work, we have considered how 
minimum data standards and ontology structures 
might be utilized to help inform the design of 
databases. However, it is also important to be clear 
about the distinction between ontologies and 
data/information models. Well-formulated ontologies 
are designed to describe classes of entities in reality 
and how these classes invariably relate to each other. 
The structure of ontologies should not be context 
dependent. In contrast, data models are focused on 
supporting instance level data in which specific 
representatives of entity classes are described 
together with their characteristics that distinguish 
individuals from each other within the class. Thus, 
data models need to be able to capture and integrate 
instance-level 
characteristics 
and 
context 
dependencies.

In the study reported here, we have attempted to 
investigate whether it would be possible to integrate 
these two components of knowledge representation 
in such a way as to leverage the class-level structural 
characteristics provided by a set of well-formulated 
reference ontologies as an underlying common 
database framework that could then be extended in a 
consistent fashion to incorporate the instance-specific 
details. We have specifically applied this strategy to 
the representation of clinical research data, including 
the study design components found in clinical 
protocols, clinical assessment results captured in case 
report forms and laboratory results obtained from the 
evaluation of derived human specimens. The end 
result is the Ontology-Based eXtensible (OBX) data 
model. 
Methods and Results 
Two reference ontologies were chosen as the 
foundation for OBX design – Basic Formal Ontology 
(BFO) and Ontology for Biomedical Investigation 
(OBI). BFO (http://www.ifomis.org/bfo) was originally 
conceived of by Smith and Grenon as an upper level 
ontology that could serve as a framework to support 
the development of domain-specific ontologies for 
scientific research4. The BFO structure is based on 
the central dichotomy between objects (continuants) 
and processes (occurrents), reflecting their distinct 
relationships with time. Continuants endure through 
time and retain some notion of their identity even 
while 
undergoing 
various 
kinds 
of 
changes. 
Occurrents unfold in time and can be defined to 
include temporal starts and ends. Continuants can be 
further sub-divided into those physical objects that 
exist independent from other entities – independent 
continuants (e.g. organs, tissues, cells, molecules, 
etc.) – and things that depend on physical objects for 
their existence – dependent continuants (e.g. the color 
red, the investigator role, the ribonuclease molecular 
function). OBI (http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi/) 
builds upon BFO, extending the core structure by 
describing those entities that are specific to the 
biomedical research domain. For example, occurrent 
is extended to include subtypes of various planned 
process like biomaterial transformation, assay and 
data transformation; independent continuant is 
extended to include biomaterial and instrument; 
dependent continuant is extended to include 
investigator role, analyte role, evaluant role. Both 
BFO and OBI have been built using a strict is_a 
hierarchy 
of 
type/subtype 
relations 
and 
are 
compliance 
with 
the 
principles 
for 
ontology 
development best practices as promulgated by the 
OBO Foundry (http://www.obofoundry.org/crit.shtml). 
In order to determine if the structure of these 
ontologies could be used to build a database that 
could support the management of a wide range of 
data derived from clinical and translational research 
studies, we extracted the core structure of the OBI 
extension 
of 
the 
BFO 
and 
developed 
a 
conceptualization of the core components as a 
starting point for data modeling (Figure 1A). The 
central component of the core conceptual model is 
the Event table, which includes descriptions of the 
actual events that happened it the study. These actual 
events may or may not be planned. A planned event 
is a realization of Procedure Specification; this 
separation allows for situations in which the actual 
event deviates from what was planned. Each event 
may also include one or more objects that play 
defined input and output roles. Each event also 
occurs in a specified time context. And finally, each 
event occurs in the context of a specific study that 
describes the actual realization of a study design. 
Next we took this OBX Core Conceptual Model and 
used it as a framework to describe specific entities 
that need to be described in the clinical research 
database component of ImmPort and how they relate 
to each other. Again, we relied on OBI/BFO ontology 
design principles to capture the specific distinctions 
of the specific entities. For example, events are 
further 
specified 
to 
include 
Biomaterial 
Transformation defined as events with one or more 
biomaterials as inputs and outputs, which can be 
further specified into Merging and Biosampling 
subtypes (Figure 1B). One example of an important 
merging type of event is the substance intervention, 
whose description includes details about the type of 
compound included, and the formulation, dose and 
route of delivery used. In the case of biosampling, the 
input subject and the output biosample are specified 
in the data model. In this way, a wide variety of 
different events can be defined by describing the 
event type, the input and output continuants and the 
roles that they play in the process. In addition, the 
OBX Core is also compatible with the modeling of 
unplanned processes, including protocol deviations 
and adverse events of critical importance to the 
clinical research domain.  
The following class and class subtypes have been 
modeled in this way: 
•  
Object – population, population arm, human 
subject, animal subject, biological sample, 
compound, 
complex 
compound, 
software, 
instrument, site; 
•

table joining procedures in order to optimize database 
performance. A complete representation of the

We compared the OBX approach to other relevant 
data representation approaches in the clinical 
research domain. The Clinical Data Interchange 
Standards Consortium (CDISC, www.cdisc.org), a 
global multi-disciplinary organization, has developed 
a set of clinical data standards to facilitate global 
clinical data interoperability and exchange. The 
Study Data Tabulation Model (STDM) is one of the 
data standards developed by CDISC, which has been 
adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to be the standard format for clinical trial data 
to be submitted to the FDA. In STDM, observations 
collected during the study are divided into three 
classes: 
Interventions, 
Events, 
or 
Findings. 
Interventions class captures investigational treatments 
and is further divided into three domains (Figure 1C): 
Concomitant Medications (ConMeds), Exposure, and 
Substance Use (Subst Use). 
The OBX model places CDISC-STDM Interventions 
class under Biomaterial Transformation given that 
both the input and output in the Interventions class 
are biomaterials. The inputs for Concomitant 
Medications, Exposure or Substance Use are subjects 
of 
the 
study 
and 
concomitant 
medications, 
investigational drugs or self-administered substances, 
respectively. The outputs of these interventional 
processes are also subjects of the study. However, 
instead of using three different domains to represent 
essentially the same process, OBX recognizes the 
difference 
between 
Concomitant 
Medications, 
Exposure, and Substance Use is the role that the 
substance plays in this Substance Merging process 
(see Figure 1B). By adding a Compound Role 
attribute, the Substance Merging class encompasses 
the information that is captured in all three STDM 
interventional domains. 
Discussion 
The Ontology-Based eXtensible data model was 
developed to support the implementation of the 
clinical research database component of the ImmPort 
system. We are currently in the process of mapping 
components of a variety of clinical studies from the 
Atopic Dermatitis Vaccinia Network and the Immune 
Tolerance Network into this model representation. 
Based on this exercise, we are continuing to refine 
the conceptual model to ensure that we can not only 
describe the basic entities in a clinical study, e.g. 
human subject, biosamples, assays, assessments and 
assessment results but also the more complex 
components of a clinical study, e.g. protocol 
deviations, adverse events, study arm specifications 
and composite events like the clinical visit. 
During the refinement process, several advantages of 
the OBX approach have been noted. The relatively 
simple structure of OBX has made it relatively easy 
to add new class tables to the schema without 
disrupting the existing structure. The logical 
framework used provides a consistent mechanism for 
linking component entities together. It is relatively 
easy to re-use entity tables as needed in generating 
primary key-foreign key relationships. The fact the 
OBX is based on the logical framework of BFO/OBI 
allows for its obvious integration with ontology term 
use as values for specific data elements in the 
database record instances. 
We have recently completed a physical database 
schema based on this model, which is made freely 
available at www.immport.org. The OBX schema is 
being used to support the capture, managements and 
query of clinical research data in the ImmPort system 
for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Disease. Adoption of OBX by other organization 
interested in managing clinical research data would 
support data sharing, system interoperability and 
semantic query of this value data content.

Abstract 
This article discusses a fundamental issues of 
medical ontology based on ontological theory. We 
focus on "anatomical structure of organs" and 
"abnormal states in the human body". On the basis of 
the investigation, we distinguish organ-specific types 
from those independent of any organ to maximize the 
explicitness of ontology. The next feature of our 
ontology is to allow on-demand reorganization of is-
a hierarchy of diseases instead of one fixed hierarchy 
to cope with various viewpoints which physician 
might have. We also take care of the notorious issue 
related to conflict of is-a and part-of relations.  
Introduction 
Ontology is one of the most promising techniques for 
enabling 
semantic 
interoperability 
of 
medical 
information among various data across domains/tasks. 
This is why there have been developed some 
ontologies such as SNOMED-CT1, ICD-102, Galen3, 
etc. In this situation, there has been strong need of a 
sophisticated medical ontology in Japanese which is 
highly expected to compatible with those existing 
ontologies. The authors believe that the ontology 
cannot be a simple translation of the existing 
ontologies because that would hide some possible 
concepts specific to Japanese clinical practice. We 
should first establish our own ontology to reflect 
Japanese clinical practice and then investigate 
alignment between the Japanese one and existing 
ones to make them interoperable with each other. 
Another reason for this policy is that those existing 
ontologies suffer from so-called “legacy problem”, 
that is, some of them are incomplete in terms of 
ontological  theories since they had started their 
project when ontological engineering was not 
matured enough. As a late comer, we aim at building 
a medical ontology which is ontologically sound. 
In this background, the Japanese ministry of 
health, labour and welfare has launched a three-year 
project on Foundation of Database for Clinical 
Knowledge in 2008. The expecting deliverable is a 
clinical ontology composed of roughly 30,000 
concepts or more covering a couple of thousands of 
diseases in typical clinical and anatomical domains. 
This paper is an intermediate report on the ontology 
development conducted in the project and is 
structured as follows. The next section discusses the 
underlying policy in the ontology development. 
Human body structure with the focus on organs is 
discussed in Section 3. Diseases are discussed in 
Section 4. Section 5 presents related work to locate 
our project in the right context followed by 
concluding remarks. 
Underlying Policy 
Our ontology is being developed having the following 
issues in our mind. These issues lead us to introduce 
several new theories and ideas as explained below.  
a) Commonality vs. specificity: In order to make 
it more articulate, common characteristics and target­
thing-specificities should be clearly captured and 
differentiated. We introduced generic structural 
/disorder components each of which represents 
common characteristics of structural and disorder 
components as much as possible.  
b) is-a vs. part-of issue 1: For example, the two 
relations <disease of a pulmonary valve is-a disease 
of heart> and < pulmonary valve part-of heart> cause 
a problem, since both “disease of a pulmonary valve” 
and “disease of a heart” have a slot of site of the 
disease and the filler of the former must be a subclass 
of the latter from the theory of inheritance, in reality, 
however, the former must be a part of the latter. To 
solve this problem, on the basis of our latest theory of 
roles4, we introduced “p-” operator in our ontology 
building tool Hozo4,5 which automatically generates a 
generic concept representing all the parts of the thing 
the operator is attached. 
c) is-a vs. part-of issue 2: The atrium is 
composed of left and right atriums. At the same time, 
however, both left and right atriums are subclasses of 
the atrium. Fortunately, the “p-” operator can solve 
this issue at the same time. 
d) No single hierarchy of diseases does not work 
well for all the stake holders such as pathologists, 
clinicians and surgeons, etc. To cope with these 
various viewpoints, we introduced an innovative 
technique to realize on-demand reorganization of is-
a hierarch according to the specified viewpoints.

Human Body Structure 
Upper-Level Types 
Figure 1 shows the top-level types of the structural part 
of human body. Organ in general consists of organ and 
organ system. Organ consists of internal organ, body 
part, portion of tissue & cells and generic structure 
component. Internal organ represents ordinary organs 
such as heart, portion of tissue & cells  includes finer-
grained organs such as gastric gland as well as tissue 
and cells, body part includes structural parts such as 
face, arms, legs, et al. The design rationale of the top-
level structure is that to represent it in a compact 
recursive structure reflecting the essential properties of 
several important types of organs. In fact, the nested 
structure of cells, tissues, minimal-organs, organs and 
organ system are nicely represented in the recursive 
structure. The details of generic structure are explained 
below. 
Figure 1. Top-level structure of human body. 
Generic Structural Components 
Many of the organs which consist of several sub-organs 
share common structural components. For example, we 
can identify hollow structure component in a stomach 
and atrium. Tubular structure components are found in 
blood vessel and esophagus. Although the materials are 
different, gastric wall and cardiac wall share three-
layer structure of tissue which we call wall-type 
structure component. Those common structural 
components enable us compact representation of those 
organs because common properties can be defined once 
at those components. Typical examples of the utility of 
such representation include that tabular structure has a 
potential malfunction of arctation caused by narrowed 
cross section area. When it occurs at blood vessel, it is 
called angiostenosis which would occur at cerebral 
vasculature, coronary artery, etc. as well. All share 
similar properties. Arctation occurs at esophagus and it 
blocks the flow of pieces of foods down to the stomach, 
which is analog to the angiostenosis case. All of them 
share widening operations as a possible treatment for 
its remedy, though how to implement it would be 
different from each other. Properties specific to each 
organ can be defined additionally or by specializing the 
properties inherited from the common structural 
component. For example, although vein and esophagus 
share the tubular structure component, vein has a valve 
of vein but esophagus does not. While both vein and 
esophagus are composed of a three-layer wall; that of 
esophagus has two-layer muscle fiber structure to 
perform peristaltic action. 
In order to represent such specificity, we introduce 
the concept of Roles supported by Hozo which is a tool 
for building ontology developed by us5. Figure 2 shows 
the legend of type definition in Hozo as well as role 
definition in which “bike” is defined by specifying its 
part. “p/o” stands for “part-of” link. At the same time, a 
role named “front wheel role” is defined by referring to 
“wheel” defined elsewhere. In Hozo, an entity playing 
a role is called “role-holder”. In the case of Figure 2, a 
wheel which is incorporated as a part of a bike and 
playing the role of “front wheel role” is thereby called 
a “front wheel”. Hozo, thus, realizes representation the 
mutual dependency between the whole and its parts4.

Advanced Issue of is-a and part-of Relations 
Contrary to the superficially simple characteristics of 
is-a and part-of relations, there have been two 
serious issues to solve such as b) and c) shown in 
section 2. Figure 3 shows the first difficulty b). 
Following the property inheritance, pulmonary valve 
must be a specialization of heart, but it is not. To 
represent the is-a relation between disease of heart 
and disease of pulmonary valve, we need to invent to 
inherit parts of heart rather than its subclass from 
heart. 
The second difficulty seems to be more serious 
than b), since it is related to fundamental 
conceptualization of what is a whole of collectives.

This difficulty has been discussed by Udo Hahn and 
his group6. In order to solve this difficulty, they 
introduced SEP-triple which consists of three 
concepts: the original entity called E-node as a whole 
together with two concepts derived from the original 
one: One called S-node and the other called P-node. 
S-node is a super class of both E-node and P-node. 
The key idea is the introduction of a generic concept 
representing all the parts of the original entity under 
consideration.  
We first tackled the issue b) and came up with a 
new operator named “p-“ operator explained above. 
The operator enables parts to be inherited by ordinary 
property inheritance mechanism. In the case of 
Figure 3, for example, we write “p-heart” instead of 
“heart”, then the slot of its subclass inherits not 
subclass of “heart” but its parts. Although this 
method would suggest we need complicated hidden 
processes in Hozo, it is not the case. When p-X is 
used, Hozo automatically generates a generic concept 
representing all defined parts of X including all parts 
which have X as their ancestor. This is valid because 
each part is-a subclass of “X’s parts class” which 
coincides with p-X. According to mereology, the 
theory of parts, p-X includes itself which is not the 
very X as an entity but X as its part. This is why “p-” 
operator can solve the issue c).

inheritance from super to sub concepts. 
Definition of Disease 
Disease as an Abnormal State 
It is apparent that capturing diseases is a tough 
problem from the beginning. In fact, there are many 
ways of categorization of diseases. Patients use 
common sense names of diseases. What doctors of 
primary care deal with and what the government 
deals with to calculate statistics of the cause of death 
are very different. In addition, pathologists, clinicians 
and surgeons see the same disease different points of 
view. Those differences result in multiple taxonomies 
of diseases. When ontology developers build an 
ontology, they tend to present one is-a hierarchy 
believing it is the essential structure of the world 
under consideration. Although it is often true, it is not 
the case in medical ontology in which disease 
classification is essentially perspective-dependent as 
we see above. To cope with this well-known 
difficulty, we adopted the strategy as follows: (1) 
building the most fundamental is-a hierarchy of 
diseases based on “state” and (2) on-demand 
generation of is-a hierarchy according to the 
viewpoint specified. Ontologically, pathological state, 
disease, symptom, syndrome, disorder, dysfunction, 
failure, cause, etc. are kinds of disorder of human 
body and can be represented as “states”. On the basis 
of this fact, the top-level categories of disease are 
developed as shown in Figure 4. 
Figure 4. Top-level categories of state. 
Upper Level Categories of Disease Quality  
State, the top-level category, has normal state and 
abnormal state. The latter has two subclasses such as 
abnormal state of human and generic disorder which 
is the type corresponding to the generic structure 
component. Officially accepted disease is the central 
type of disease and is defined by referring to other 
states. Elementary abnormal state is disorder which 
cannot be disease by itself and is mainly used for 
characterizing officially accepted disease. The main 
component of disease is pathological state which is a 
role played by abnormal state in the context of 
diseases which clinical experts accept as disease. 
Basically, each state is defined in terms of <Entity, 
Attribute, Value>, EAV-triple. We have investigated 
the survey of the current clinical practice in Japan and 
found EAV-triple works quite successfully. We also 
analyzed quality descriptions in ICD-10 and Galen 
and found that most of them are covered by the 
ontology of quality and quantity defined in YATO7 
and we can convert them into the form of EAV-triple. 
Officially Accepted Disease 
Figure 5 shows the framework of officially 
accepted disease. It is defined by specifying 
typical disorder roles played by abnormal state 
which is based on EAV-triple. Depending on 
expert’s decision, some abnormal states become

pathological state, some become symptom derived 
by the pathological state. This is our way of 
defining diseases based on states with the help of 
role-defining function of Hozo. Exploiting the 
fundamental characteristics of states and the 
expressive power of role representation of Hozo, 
definition of disease can be easily adjusted to the 
current understanding of the disease under 
consideration, which makes the ontology both 
solid and flexible at the same time. In fact, the 
same abnormal state can be pathological state or 
symptom according to the context of disease of 
interest. Furthermore, the fact that boundaries 
between those states are intrinsically vague 
prevents us from defining them as established 
types which are hard to change. Roles which 
intrinsically change according to the context best 
fits to definition of those states. 
Figure 5. The framework of officially accepted disease. 
On-Demand Reproduction of is-a Hierarchy  
As discussed above, on-demand function is 
critically important to make clinically acceptable 
for experts in many divisions in medicine. The 
state-based disease definition with Hozo tool 
allows us to achieve this demanding goal. Diseases 
are defined as subclasses of officially accepted 
disease shown in Figure 5 and they have several 
slots with classes for constraining slot values. In 
Figure 5, examples are abnormal state and 
physical. If users want to see is-a hierarchy of 
diseases in terms of the partonomy of organs, then 
they just specify physical which is where diseases 
locate. Of course, the partonomy is converted into 
is-a hierarchy by Hozo using “p-” operator 
technology. If they want to see the hierarchy in 
terms of pathological state, then they specify it. 
We have already built a prototype system for this 
functionality and confirmed its feasibility. We have 
also manually mapped the ICD-10 concepts to ours 
in the prototype system of ontology navigation to 
enable users who want to browse our ontology 
from the ICD-10 contents. The demonstration of the 
functionality is available at: 
http://www.ei.sanken.osaka- u.ac.jp/MedOnto/. 
Concluding Remarks 
We did preliminary comparison between our ontology 
with existing ontologies such as SNOMED-CT, FMA, 
CARO8, ICD-10 and GALEN and confirmed the 
ontological soundness of our ontology which is 
compliant with YATO which is comparable to BFO9 
and DOLCE10. In addition to this, it has major 
advantages over them with respect to the following 
three perspectives: 1) explicit representation of 
commonality and specificity of structure and diseases, 
2) resolution of the notorious problem of inter­
dependence between is-a and part-of relations and 3) 
on-demand reorganization of is-a hierarchy of 
diseases. In the preliminary comparison, we 
investigated FMA in terms of the difficulty 2) and 
found that FMA tries to solve it by introducing a lot 
of redundant virtual classes and ends up with partial 
solution of the problem in the sense that it fails to 
solve the issue of c) in Section 2.  We are currently in 
the phase of increasing diseases of several clinical 
divisions by tight collaboration with clinical doctors 
using a description support system we developed to 
help them input data.

Concepts, Confusion and Modeling 
Harold R. Solbrig, Christopher G. Chute 
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA 
Abstract 
The term “concept” continues to be used in models 
to 
reference 
categories, 
classes, 
universals, 
individuals and other less well defined artifacts. The 
fact that this obfuscates the purpose and usefulness 
of the model itself has already been well documented. 
Here, we show how the use of the term “concept” as 
a class name in a model can introduce serious 
confusion and propose a simple way that such 
confusion can be avoided. 
Introduction 
There are many modeling efforts underway that 
attempt 
to 
address 
the 
relationship 
between 
knowledge about the external world and information 
recorded in databases, forms and messages. Despite 
admonitions to the contrary1,2, most of these models 
still use the term “concept” to designate a variety of 
different 
entities 
(and 
non-entities), 
including 
individuals, 
universals, 
categories, 
words, 
imaginings, etc.  
With a couple of notable exceptions3,4, the term 
“concept” is also used as a label for a class within the 
models themselves. In the sections that follow, we 
begin by discussing the role of class labels in 
modeling meta-levels and then show how using 
“concept” as a class name obfuscates the intent of the 
model and introduces crippling confusion. We then 
discuss a simple solution that, while not addressing 
the more fundamental issues introduced by of the use 
of the notion of “concept” itself, at least helps to 
clarify the purpose of such a class in this sort of 
modeling effort.  
M0-M3 Modeling Levels 
Modelers typically assign labels to classes, attributes 
and associations in a model that match the name of 
external entity being modeled. An exception to this 
rule, however, is when the models are used to 
describe aspects of the modeling effort itself. In this 
situation, modelers have learned the importance of 
unambiguously differentiating the names of the 
modeling artifacts from the names of the entities 
being modeled. Let’s start with a simple example, 
“person”. 
Figure 1. M0 Modeling Level 
In figure 1, we’ve recorded some information about 
two “real world” (well, stick figures for this 
document, but they represent real world) people. This 
information is recorded at the M0 metalevel5. 
In order to catalog and share information about 
people in general, we need to arrive at: 
1.  An 
understanding 
and 
definition 
of 
the 
abstraction (universal) that we wish to represent. 
In this case, we might decide that the abstraction 
is “Human”. 
2.  A list of the salient characteristics that are shared 
by representative members of this abstraction. 
(Figure 2)

We then need to use the modeling context to 
determine which of these characteristics are: 
(a) Are assumed to have fixed values 
(b) Are considered irrelevant 
(c) Carry real information  
We then add any additional characteristics that are 
specific to the model itself, such as a unique 
identifier for the instance record. Finally, we assign 
labels to characteristics in category (c) above and 
produce a model that becomes the M1 model. 
In our example, we may be constructing a database 
of people who were born in Iceland, meaning that the 
country of birth attribute is fixed. We may determine 
that the hair color and age are irrelevant, and that the 
information that we want to carry is the person’s 
name, their gender and how old they were at some 
known point in time (Figure 3). 
Figure 3. M1 Modeling Level 
This model is of little value, however, unless we have 
a shared understanding of the semantics of the model 
itself. We need to understand what “class”, 
“attribute”, “data type”, “visibility”, etc. represent 
and how they are rendered in a class diagram. To do 
this, we repeat the process described above but, 
instead of describing people, age, hair color, etc. We 
now describe class, attribute, visibility, etc. The 
result of this process is a “meta-model” – a model of 
a modeling language. 
Figure 4. M2 Modeling Level 
We now have a model of the semantics of what is, in 
our case, a UML model (Figure 4). We still need one 
more step, before we can close the loop – we need a 
model of the language of modeling itself (Figure 5): 
Figure 5. M3 Modeling Level 
The M3 level gives us closure, as M3 level models 
are either axiomatic or self describing.  Note how 
different labels have been used for the M2 and M3 
level entities.  Even though they appear very similar, 
they are referencing different things. The M2 level 
describes a model and the M3 level describes the 
language of modeling itself. 
“Concept” in the Modeling Levels 
We now repeat this description, but this time we will 
replace models involving people with models of the 
descriptions of entities, which, unfortunately, are 
typically called “concepts”.

concept of “primate” become the real world entities 
about which we record information.

Figure 7. Abstraction of Characteristics 
We then proceed to abstract the salient characteristics 
of “concept” and determine the fixed, irrelevant and 
information carrying characteristics in our particular 
context (Figure 7). As with the previous example, we 
may also add modeling specific information to arrive 
at an M1 level model (Figure 8). 
This is where the confusion begins. In the previous 
example, instances of the class “Person” are 
obviously data records which, in turn, are about real 
world people. In this example, however, this 
distinction isn’t clear. Following our previous model, 
instances of the class “Concept” should be data 
records which, in turn, are about real world concepts. 
The notion of “concept” is so ephemeral, however, 
that it is tempting to try to assert that, instead of 
being about a concept, the data record is the concept. 
If you define “concept” as “A unit of knowledge 
created by a unique combination of characteristics,” 
you need to know when you have got one of those 
“units”, and a database record is an obvious 
candidate. Defining “concept” as “anything that can 
be conceived or perceived” does little to help, as the 
data record may well be more conceivable or 
perceivable than the “thing” that it is intended to 
represent. 
Figure 8. M1 Modeling Level 
Once we’ve allowed the M0 level data record to 
become the target of the M1 class model, we find 
ourselves in a quandary. How do we differentiate the 
M0 instance “human” which describes the external 
universal, “human” and the M1 instance “person” in 
the previous example which describes an M0 
description of a particular person? Even more 
insidious, however, is the discovery that the M1 class 
“Concept” now describes concepts and there is 
strong temptation to say that “Concept” is an instance 
of itself. This, in turn, leads to countless hours of 
useless discussion about “Isn’t Person a concept?”, 
“Why haven’t we made Ordered List a subtype of 
concept?”, “Do we have the concept “red” stored in 
our database?” and “Do all concepts have codes?” 
One is reminded of a scene from the movie, Being 
John Malkovich, where John physically ventures 
inside his own head – recursively perceiving how he 
perceives the world. The result is mass confusion – 
everything that John Malkovich perceives is John 
Malkovich. All the characters he interacts with are 
himself and the only words that are spoken are 
“Malkovich, Malkovich, …”. 
How Can We Fix This? 
We need to focus on the misunderstanding that got us 
into this mess to begin with – the confusion of a data 
record that describes a concept with the concept 
itself. 
The obvious solution to this problem would be to 
stop using the term “concept” altogether. As argued 
by Smith and many others, our business is not 
125

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
creating models of anything that can be perceived or 
conceived – our business is creating models of reality 
– models that can be communicated, verified and 
used constructively in the discipline of science. The 
notion of “concepts” obfuscates the model and makes 
errors inevitable. Unfortunately, to date, this is still a 
losing battle. The best can do is to mitigate the 
damage. 
The key fact that we need to recognize that (a) we are 
working with a model of universals and (b) like it or 
not, people are going to continue to refer to these as 
“concepts” and because of this we are unable to 
readily different the model and the thing being 
modeled. This is the same problem faced by the M2 
and M3 models described earlier – when you are 
using a class in a model to describe an instance of a 
class in another model, it is important to give the 
class and instances different names.  In the previous 
example, we named the instance “UML Class” and 
the class “MetaClass”. 
Figure 9. Revised M1 Level Model 
Just like the M2 / M3 levels above, we need to assign 
the M1 model element a different name! Were we to 
replace 
the 
label 
“Concept” 
with 
“Concept 
Description” at the M1 level, we have effectively 
broken the circuit. Now, the M0 “Primate” is clearly 
an instance of a Concept Description, which, in turn 
describes the external entity, “Primate”. Where it 
previously seemed to make sense to ask “Isn’t 
Concept a concept?” the question “Isn’t Concept 
Description a concept” is somewhat more sensible. 
Some of the questions we posed previously now have 
more obvious answers. “Is a person a concept 
description?” “Why isn’t an ordered list a concept 
description?” “Do we have the concept description 
“red”, in our database?” Concept descriptions may 
have codes – but concepts do not have codes, at least 
in any normal sense of the word. 
Additional benefits include the recognition that 
concept (description) systems contain sets of concept 
descriptions, which, in turn, reference concepts. 
Questions about can the same concept be in more 
than one concept system become irrelevant, as the 
concepts aren’t in a concept system. The question, 
instead, is can the same concept description belong to 
more than one system, which can be answered by a 
sensible discussion about what constitutes identity 
for a concept description rather than debating about 
what constitutes the identity for a concept. 
Summary 
The ideal solution to the “concept” problem would be 
to cease using such an ambiguous and confusing 
label. Short of that, however, much of the current 
modeling confusion could be eliminated through the 
simple act of renaming the class “concept” to more 
accurately reflect what it actually represents.

A Quality Evaluation Framework for Bio-Ontologies

Abstract 
Over the past few years the number of bio-ontologies 
has rapidly increased. The evaluation of ontologies 
has long been a problematic issue. The growing 
number of ontologies makes the need for a strategy 
for evaluating quality more urgent. We propose a 
framework for evaluating the quality of bio­
ontologies. This framework is inspired by a well-
known software quality standard, which has been 
adapted to the needs of ontology evaluation. An 
example of how to use the framework, comparing two 
versions of the Open biomedical Ontologies' Cell 
Type Ontology, is included as an illustration. 
Introduction 
Bio-ontologies have increased in number and 
importance since the development of the Gene 
Ontology. Many research groups are collaborating in 
the development of an orthogonal collection of bio­
ontologies, the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) 
Foundry (http://www.obofoundry.org). In addition, 
there also exist independent efforts for developing 
other bio-ontologies. The development of application 
ontologies, for example, usually requires the reuse of 
different ontologies, so bits from different ontologies 
have to be combined. For this purpose, developers 
have to decide which ontology to use, but they lack 
support for making an informed decision. Hence, there 
is a clear need for methods for evaluating the quality 
of bio-ontologies. Ontology quality evaluation has 
usually been the concern of the Ontology Engineering 
community, and has been addressed from different 
perspectives and hence related work in ontology 
evaluation can be classified according to the particular 
evaluation aim: ranking, correctness, or quality. 
Ontology Engineering has historically adapted 
methods from the Software Engineering field since 
they have many stages in common. Recent examples 
are 
ontology 
development 
methodologies1 
or 
Ontology Design Patterns2. There has not, however, 
been any attempt to adapt Software Engineering 
approaches for evaluating ontology quality. In this 
work, we propose an evaluation framework for bio­
ontologies that is inspired by the ISO 9126 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9126) standard for 
software quality, which has been applied in other 
fields, for different purposes, such as the evaluation 
of e-learning systems3 or software design documents4. 
Its application is recommended because: (1) it 
provides a comprehensive specification and evaluation 
model for software product quality; (2) it addresses 
user needs of a product by allowing for a common 
language for specifying user requirements that is 
understandable by users, developers and evaluators; 
(3) it objectively evaluates quality of software 
products based on observation; and (4) it makes 
quality evaluation reproducible. All these properties 
are desirable for an ontology quality evaluation 
approach, and hence they represent a potentially 
useful tool e such a framework. 
Furthermore, this standard does not attempt to 
provide mechanisms for accumulating the metrics 
into an overall numeric evaluation. Given the 
different possible uses of ontologies, there is no need 
for such mechanisms, but rather there is a need for 
mechanisms capable of indicating which ontologies 
are more appropriate for particular situations. Also, 
this standard incorporates elements from the state of 
the art on ontology evaluation frameworks. An 
example of the usage of the framework is provided by 
evaluating two versions of the Cell Type Ontology5: 
the OBO version and a version that was re-engineered 
using a technique called Normalization6. 
Framework for Bio-Ontologies Quality Evaluation 
In Software Engineering, software quality measures 
the quality of software design, and to which extent the 
software conforms to that design. The ISO 9126 
standard for software quality evaluation provides a 
model based on internal, external and in-use quality 
metrics: functionality, reliability, portability, usability, 
maintainability, efficiency, effectiveness, productivity, 
physical security and user satisfaction. An internal 
metric can be used for measuring an attribute of a 
software product, derived from the product itself, 
either directly or indirectly (it is not derived from 
measures of the behavior of the system).Internal 
metrics are applicable to a non executable software 
product during designing and coding in early stages 
of the development process. An external metric can 
be used for measuring an attribute of a software 
product, derived from the behavior of the system of 
which it is a part. External metrics are applicable to 
an executable software product during testing or 
operating in later stages of development and after 
entering to an operational process. Quality in use 
metrics are those applicable to the final product in 
real conditions.

Using such a standard as a reference for defining an 
ontology evaluation framework is reasonable due to 
the intrinsic benefits provided by the use of standards, 
and the context that it would provide for a systematic 
evaluation of ontology quality. Therefore we propose 
a framework for evaluating ontology quality based on 
such a standard. The framework comprises seven 
quality dimensions, and these categories have these 
evaluation metrics associated (Figure 1): 
Structural: This category is the only one in this 
framework that is not specified as such in the ISO 
9126, but it is important when evaluating ontologies, 
since it accounts for software quality factors such as 
consistency, formalization, redundancy or tangledness. 
Functionality: How the ontology performs in its 
intended roles. 
Reliability: Capability of an ontology to maintain its 
level of performance under stated conditions for a 
given period of time. 
Usability: Readability and ease of reuse. 
Efficiency: Relationship between the level of 
performance of the software and the amount of 
resources used, under stated conditions, taking into 
account elements such as the time response, or 
memory consumption. Unfortunately, the field of OE 
has not developed good mechanisms to evaluate 
efficiency appropriately. 
Maintainability: The effort needed to make specified 
modifications, how changes affect the rest of the 
ontology, etc. 
Quality in Use: Quality in a particular context of use, 
provided by the users. 
Next, we describe the interpretation of some of the 
metrics, when applied to ontologies, as follows: 
Structural – Formalization: An efficient ontology has 
to be built on top of a semantically strict model to 
support reasoning. In the case of bio-ontology 
languages, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has a 
strict semantics, the Open Biomedical Ontologies 
language (OBO) does not have such semantic 
definition, but has been defined in relation to OWL7. 
Structural – Formal Relations Support: Most 
ontologies only have formal support for taxonomy. 
This would indicate if any other formal theories are 
supporting the relations. The evaluation of this 
criterion for a bio-ontology depends on the number 
of formally supported relations included in it, for 
instance, through the use of the Relations Ontology 
(RO)8. 
Functionality – Competence Adequacy- Consistent 
Search and Query: The formal model of the ontology 
allows for better querying and searching methods.

Results 
The Cell Type Ontology (CTO) was designed as a 
structured controlled vocabulary for cell types. CTO 
was constructed to integrate the model organism 
databases and other bioinformatics databases. In 
order to test the evaluation framework two versions 
of CTO were evaluated. The original version of CTO, 
oCTO, was the conversion of the OBO file to OWL. 
The normalized CTO, nCTO, was created by 
collaboratively dissecting the original CTO and then 
recreating the structure using reasoning (see: 
http://www.gong.manchester.ac.uk/odp/html/Normali 
sation.html). 
The evaluation of the quality of these ontologies was 
performed by eight MSc students of the Semantic 
Web course at the University of Murcia. Before doing 
this work, the students were trained in this course for 
20 hours in the design of ontologies, they analyzed

some of the most prominent ontologies (including 
biomedical ones) and they were also trained in the 
application of this evaluation framework. Then, they 
were given two weeks to evaluate both ontologies.  
Each student had to fill in a form for each ontology, 
providing a quantitative evaluation for each quality 
metric included in the framework. The value ranged 
between 1(worst) and 5 (best). They were optionally 
allowed to provide comments on their evaluations. 
The usage of a quality evaluation framework does 
not require providing a numerical score for the 
evaluated items. In this case, we have averaged the 
results for each quality criterion for descriptive 
purpose, and all the quality criteria have been equally 
weighted. The results of this experiment are shown in 
Figure 2. A radar graph has been used for such 
purpose, since it allows an easy comparison of the 
quality of the two ontologies. The evaluators have 
given to nCTO a higher score in terms of structural, 
functional, usability, reliability and maintainability 
quality, whereas no big differences are found in terms 
of efficiency and quality in use.  
Figure 2. Results of the experiment 
As has been mentioned, eight people have 
participated in this evaluation experiment, so the 
analysis of the degree of agreement between them is 
an interesting issue. All the evaluators gave a higher 
score to nCTO for the structural dimension; seven 
did so for functionality and usability; six did so for 
reliability and maintainability. It might be said that 
there is a consensus across these categories. In terms 
of efficiency, four evaluators gave a higher score to 
nCTO and three to oCTO. Four evaluators gave a 
higher value to nCTO and four to oCTO in the quality 
of use criterion. The evaluation of quality in use is 
the average of effectiveness and user satisfaction, 
which is split into popularity and engagement. In this 
sense, oCTO gets a higher score for user satisfaction, 
and a lower for effectiveness, due to its better 
structure. Hence, due to the effects of the numeric 
average, nCTO gets a slightly higher value for this 
quality dimension. So, in terms of efficiency and 
quality of use, there is no consensus. Both ontologies 
and the complete results of this experiment can be 
found at http://dis.um.es/~jfernand/icbo. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
The evaluation of ontology quality is a critical issue 
that 
remains 
unsolved. 
Different 
approaches 
accounting for different perspectives and aspects of 
ontology evaluation have been proposed in recent 
years, although none has become standard. In 
general, usability, reliability, and functionality criteria 
are identified in such approaches for evaluating 
quality, whereas those focused on ranking and 
correctness mainly consider structural properties. 
In our opinion, the quality of an ontology is related to 
the degree of excellence. International quality 
organizations do not assign a numerical quality value 
to all kinds of processes and products, but they give 
them a quality stamp. This also occurs with software 
development processes. Such stamps certify their 
degree of excellence, which is checked against a 
series of criteria. The ISO 9126 has been criticized 
for being too general and abstract, and for not 
providing a concrete framework to be applied, 
obtaining a numerical evaluation as a result. The 
approach presented in this paper is based on the ISO 
9216 and the framework includes most of the quality 
categories identified in the standard and incorporates 
the structural one to account for issues of particular 
importance for ontologies and it has been applied to 
two different ontologies, oCTO and nCTO. Both 
ontologies were built by applying a different 
methodology; oCTO was built in OBO and then 
transformed directly into OWL, and nCTO was built 
from 
scratch 
by 
applying 
the 
Normalization 
technique. This evaluation experiment has shown the 
usefulness of our approach, since we have obtained a 
vision of the quality of the ontologies, their strengths 
and their weaknesses, so that users have extensive 
information about the properties of both ontologies 
that can be used for making their decisions. In fact, 
quality evaluation approaches do not have to make 
decisions for the users, but provide enough 
information for them to make such decisions. As 
mentioned, the students were trained in the evaluation 
framework. This training consisted on explaining the 
meaning of the different quality dimensions used in 
the framework. Examples with ontologies were 
provided, 
using 
good 
practices 
in 
ontology

construction as the evaluation criteria. Obviously, the 
ontologies used in the training were not the ones to 
evaluate. Consequently, we think the scores were not 
biased by the training received by the students.   
We were also concerned by how difficult the 
application of the framework could be and if this 
would require much technical knowledge. The 
students did not report problems in understanding 
how to apply it. This makes us think that any person 
with knowledge in ontology construction can do it as 
well without much effort. Another issue would be 
who should apply it and evaluate the quality of bio­
ontologies9,10, but this discussion is out of the scope 
of this work. 
It should be said that this is early work, and that 
some improvements are needed. This experiment is 
as much an evaluation of the framework as it is of the 
ontologies themselves. In addition, the low number 
of relatively inexperienced ontologists makes any 
profound conclusions on the nature of the two 
ontologies suspect. We aim to design an objective 
quality evaluation framework, and this has been 
partially achieved in this work. First, the quality 
dimensions and criteria are the ones defined in the 
ISO standard, which provides an objective definition 
of quality evaluation. We have added the structural 
dimension and defined the concrete competences of 
an ontology. For this, we have used standard criteria 
for the structural dimension, drawn from the best 
practices and which are generally used for evaluation 
purposes in literature. Concerning competences, we 
are using the ones considered by the community. 
From this perspective, the framework is objective 
and not biased by our interests or preferences. What 
is not completely objective is the measurement of the 
values given by the experts. We will do further 
research in this area to gain objectivity in this part of 
the process. Finally, we plan to enrich the framework 
including metrics related to the ontology inference 
power based on the theory of justification11.

LexOWL: A Bridge from LexGrid to OWL 
Cui Tao, Jyotishman Pathak, Harold R. Solbrig, Christopher G. Chute

Abstract 
The Lexical Grid project is an on-going community 
driven initiative that provides a common terminology 
model to represent multiple vocabulary and ontology 
sources as well as a scalable and robust API for 
accessing such information. In order to add more 
powerful functionalities to the existing infrastructure 
and align LexGrid more closely with various Semantic 
Web technologies, we introduce the LexOWL project 
for representing the ontologies modeled within the 
LexGrid environment in OWL (Web Ontology 
Language). The crux of this effort is to create a 
“bridge” that functionally connects the LexBIG (a 
LexGrid API) and the OWL API (an interface that 
implements OWL) seamlessly. In this paper, we discuss 
the key aspects of designing and implementing the 
LexOWL bridge. We compared LexOWL with other 
OWL converting tools and conclude that LexOWL 
provides an OWL mapping and converting tool with 
well-defined interoperability for information in the 
biomedical domain. 
Introduction 
The Lexical Grid project (LexGrid)2,12 coordinated by 
the Mayo Clinic Division of Biomedical Statistics and 
Informatics provides support for a distributed network 
of lexical resources such as terminologies and 
ontologies via standards-based tools, storage formats, 
and access mechanisms. The LexGrid system supports 
formats such as HL7 RIM, OBO, OWL/Protégé frame, 
UMLS RRF, and LexGrid XML. It models ontology 
information 
including 
versioning, 
provenances, 
entities, associations, and instances. LexGrid loads 
ontologies and terminologies from different sources, 
maps the information into the LexGrid model, and 
stores them in a backend database. Information 
modeled by LexGrid can be accessed through LexBIG, 
an interface that implements the LexGrid model, on 
top of which standard tools and services can be built. 
A valuable augmentation to LexGrid is the adoption of 
Semantic Web technologies. The recent emergence of 
the Semantic Web and the Web Ontology Language 
(OWL)4 is fostering a new level of interoperability. 
The biomedical informatics community greatly benefit 
by applying OWL’s combination of formal semantics, 
rich expressiveness and shared software base to 
biomedical and clinical terminologies. The LexOWL 
project provides a round trip between LexGrid and 
OWL. In this paper, we focus on the direction from 
LexBIG to OWL. Through LexOWL, information 
modeled in LexGrid can be represented in OWL. 
Hence, tools and services that have been developed by 
the Semantic Web community can be directly applied 
to the biomedical and clinical domain. To name a few, 
we can use Protégé, which is a widely-used OWL 
ontology authoring tool, to browse and edit the 
information modeled in LexGrid. We can apply 
different reasoning tools to medical and clinical 
terminologies, to check consistency or to infer new 
knowledge. We can use OWL ontology modularity 
tools to integrate or extract ontology modules as well 
as use OWL ontology mapping tools to map 
ontologies. The biomedical terminology community 
has been actively seeking connections to OWL. 
OBO2OWL1, OBOInOWL9, Protégé OBO to OWL 
Tab10, and Protégé 4 OBO loader provide mappings 
and conversions from OBO to OWL. The conversion 
from UMLS Semantic Network to OWL has been 
studied6,8. The NCI Thesaurus to OWL DL conversion 
is discussed in Noy, el al11. The International 
Healthcare 
Terminology 
Standards 
Development 
Organization also released a Perl converter for 
converting from SNOMED CT to OWL in recent 
SNOMED CT releases. LexOWL augments all these 
efforts by providing LexGrid a converter to OWL. 
Compared to the other tools, LexOWL has an inherit 
advantage in that, it can convert all the ontologies and 
terminologies from different sources modeled by 
LexGrid without individual mappers and converters. 
As an immediate benefit, LexOWL provides a well-
defined interoperability across these sources since all 
the different resources are modeled by LexGrid. 
We make the following contributions in this paper: 
• 	
LexOWL functionally converts LexGrid to OWL 
through an API bridge and represents the 
information modeled in LexGrid in the OWL API 
representation. By doing so, we can leverage the 
services and tools developed for OWL and the 
Semantic Web directly. 
• 	
LexOWL provides an OWL converter with 
relatively 
well-defined 
interoperability 
for 
different 
biomedical 
terminologies 
and 
ontologies. 
• 	
LexOWL provides a dynamic interface between 
LexGrid and Protégé so that Protégé can use 
LexGrid as its backend database, which could be 
a valuable addition to Protégé 4.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We begin 
with an overview of the LexOWL system in Section 2. 
In Section 3, we discuss how LexOWL maps LexGrid 
components to OWL. In Section 4, we compare the 
OWL ontologies exported by LexOWL to those 
converted by the existing tools. Finally, in Section 5 
we summarize and consider future work. 
LexOWL System Overview 
Figure 1 shows the LexOWL system overview. The 
core component of LexOWL is the LexOWLManager. 
It manages both the LexBIG service through which we 
can access the LexBIG API, and the OWL Ontology 
manager through which we can access the OWL API. 
On the left hand side of the system overview, the 
LexGrid system loads ontologies in different formats 
from different sources, translates them to LexGrid 
representation as well as saves the knowledge to a 
relational database. Through the LexBIG API, 
LexOWL can access the ontologies loaded in the 
database. On the right hand side of the system 
overview, through the OWL API, LexOWL re-
represents the information in the LexGrid database 
virtually to the OWL API Ontology representation, 
which can the be used directly by Protégé 4 and other 
Semantic Web tools. 
Thus, in essence, LexOWL maps LexGrid to OWL on 
the API level. It is not just a tool that maps and 
converts from one format to another. In addition to 
that, it generates a “bridge” between the two APIs. The 
“bridge” accesses information from the LexBIG API 
and translates it to the OWL API’s representations. The 
benefit of an API “bridge” is that even if the backend 
representations for ontologies change, the “bridge” still 
performs the same way and an update is not necessary. 
We also defined the LexGrid to OWL mapping and a 
lexgrid2owl meta-ontology3, based on which LexOWL 
can re-represent a selected LexGrid ontology to the 
OWL API representation. In the next section, we 
discuss how LexOWL maps LexGrid to OWL. 
Figure 1. LexOWL System Overview. 
LexGrid to OWL Mapping 
LexOWL first maps the general ontology information. 
This includes information about the ontology itself 
such as name, version, and copyright. For some 
information, we can find equivalent representations in 
OWL (e.g., codingScheme to owl:ontology, localName 
to 
rdfs:label, 
and 
representsVersion 
to 
owl:versionInfo). For some information, we can find 
equivalent representations in standard name spaces 
such as dublin core (e.g., formalName to dc:title and 
copyright to dc:rights). We used the lexgrid2owl meta­
ontology to represent the rest information (e.g, we 
define ApproxNumConcepts and isNative as two 
annotation properties in the meta- ontology). 
LexOWL maps each LexGrid concept† to an OWL  
class. A concept in the LexGrid model can have 
properties such as a concept code, descriptions, 
presentations, definitions, and sources. LexOWL uses 
the concept code as the OWL class name and assign 
concept descriptions to a set of rdfs:label. In the 
lexgrid2owl meta-ontology, we define three OWL 
classes, Presentation, Definition, and Source, to 
represent the presentations, definitions, and sources in 
the LexGrid concept properties. We also defined 
annotation properties: hasPresentation, hasDefinition, 
and hasSource in the meta-ontology, to represent the 
relationships between concepts and such properties. 
Figure 2(a) shows a sample OBO term and Figure 2(b) 
shows its LexGrid representation. Figure 2(c) shows 
how LexOWL represents this concept and its 
properties in OWL. LexOWL creates an OWL class 
for the Concept Code “TAIR:0000055” and assign the 
Entity Description “pollen development” as a 
rdfs:label. The class has three annotation properties, 
one hasDefinition and two hasPresentations, which 
link to “definition21” (an instance of the Definition 
Class), “presentation37”, and “presentation38” (two 
instances of the Presentation Class) respectively. In 
addition, “definition21” has an annotation property 
hasSource, which links to “source21”. Each of these 
instances also has annotation properties that represent 
contents such as synonyms and definitions from the 
source document. 
LexGrid also has a special kind of concepts – 
anonymous concepts – which it uses to represent the 
anonymous classes in OWL. LexOWL parses each 
anonymous class and translates it back to OWL based 
on concept properties. Figure 3 shows an example. The 
upper part shows the LexGrid representation. The 
concept “A38” is the anonymous concept which is 
† A “concept” represents a “kind” or “universal” entity in the 
LexGrid 2008 model. Here we still use “concept” to be compatible 
with LexGrid 2008. We are upgrading both LexGrid and LexOWL 
to avoid using this confusing label.

equivalent to the concept “Father”. LexOWL can 
translate it back to OWL as the lower part of Figure 3 
shows, which is identical to the original OWL 
representation.

Figure 2: An Example for Entity Mapping 
An association in the LexGrid model establishes a 
relation between two LexGrid entities. LexOWL 
classifies the LexGrid associations into two types: pre­
defined associations and other associations. A pre­
defined association can be directly mapped to an OWL 
element. For example, the associations “subClassOf” 
(OWL), “CHD” (ICD 10), and “is a” (OBO) are all 
mapped 
to 
owl:subClassOf. 
The 
association 
“hasSubtype” (UMLS) is mapped as an inverse of 
OWL 
element 
subClassOf. 
The 
associations 
“equivalentClass” (OWL) and “same as” (UMLS) are 
mapped 
to 
owl:equivalentClass.

Figure 3: An Example of Anonymous Concept  
Evaluation and Discussion 
We tested LexOWL using different ontologies from 
various sources: OWL, OBO, UMLS Semantic 
Network, and WHO ICD10. We used Protégé Prompt5 
to compare the OWL ontologies generated by 
LexOWL and by other tools. We also sampled 
concepts and associations in each test ontology and 
compared them with the original source and checked 
whether all the related information are represent 
properly. The details of the results are listed below. 
We tested on 5 OWL files. We chose these 5 
ontologies carefully so that they cover most of the 
OWL Lite syntax introduced in OWL Web Ontology 
Language Reference4. We compared the OWL 
ontologies generated by LexOWL with the original 
ontologies. Each pair of ontologies is semantically 
equivalent to each other. 
We also tested on 10 OBO files. For each OBO file, 
we compared the OWL ontology translated by 
LexOWL with those converted by OBO2OWL1, 
Protégé 3.3.1 OBO to OWL Tab10, and Protégé 4.0 
OBO loader. All the four tools mapped OBO terms to 
OWL classes, OBO “isa” to OWL subClassOf, and 
used OWL someValuesFrom to represent relationships 
two 
classes. 
Semantically, 
the 
corresponding 
ontologies from all the 4 converters are identical. 
However, each converter defined its own annotation 
properties and used different annotation properties to 
represent the same OBO information. OBO2OWL and 
Protégé 4.0 OBO loader have relatively simple and 
straightforward conversions where they used the OBO 
labels directly as the OWL annotation property names. 
Protégé OBO to OWL Tab and LexOWL processed 
information in a lower granularity (e.g., the “def” in 
Figure 2(a) is parsed and the source information is 
annotated separately.) 
We used LexOWL to export UMLS Semantic Network 
loaded in LexGrid to an OWL file and compared it 
133

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with the one converted by Jimenez-Ruiz6. LexOWL 
uses the UIs as the OWL class names versus Jimenez-
Ruiz uses the actual names. Hierarchically, these two 
ontologies are identical. Jimenez-Ruiz introduced 
some annotation properties that are specific for the 
UMLS Semantic Network where LexOWL used 
lexgrid2owl meta-ontology to represent all the 
information. For example, Jimenez-Ruiz mapped 
SRDEF to rdfs:comment, whereas LexOWL mapped it 
to lexgrid2owl:Definition, which can bring better 
interoperability since definitions of terms from other 
sources are also mapped to lexgrid2owl:Definition. 
Jimenez-Ruiz used owl:allValuesFrom to represent 
relationships between two classes and LexOWL used 
owl:someValuesFrom 
since this is the default 
restriction LexOWL uses for representing relationships 
between classes‡. 
We also used LexOWL to export ICD10 WHO second 
edition loaded in LexGrid to an OWL file and 
compared it with the OWL file converted by Cardillo, 
et al.7. Hierarchically, these two ontologies are 
identical. The ontology converted by Cardillo, et al.7 
only covered hierarchical information, however. 
Information such as exclusions and inclusions are 
ignored whereas LexOWL considered them as OWL 
ObjectProperties, thereby preserving the semantics. 
In summary, the test results show that LexOWL can 
convert information modeled in LexGrid to OWL 
successfully. LexOWL uses a single meta-ontology for 
all different sources where other tools use different 
meta-ontologies even for the same format. Hence, the 
ontologies 
converted 
by 
LexOWL 
has 
better 
Interoperability that will bring benefits in ontology 
mapping, integration and reasoning in the future. 
Concluding Remarks and Future Work 
We introduced LexOWL, a system that functionally 
connects LexGrid to OWL through a bridge over the 
LexBIG and the OWL APIs. LexOWL can represent 
information modeled in LexGrid in the OWL API 
representation, so that tools and services that are 
developed for OWL can be applied to the biomedical 
terminologies and ontologies. LexOWL also provides 
a LexGrid-to-OWL converter with a well-defined 
interoperability for information from different sources 
and in different formats. 
As for the future work, several directions remain to be 
pursued. First, we would like to investigate 
performance of LexOWL with large-sized ontologies 
such as SNOMED CT, the Gene Ontology, and ICD10. 
‡ How to represent the semantic relationships between classes in a 
more precise way is a problem we are investigating when mapping 
information to LexGrid and is out of the scope of this paper. 
We would like to add the editing and saving function 
as Figure 1 shows, so that we not only can browse, but 
also edit information represent in LexGrid using 
Protégé. Finally, LexOWL serves as a foundational 
pillar for ontology reasoning and inference. Our next 
step is to explore toward that direction on biomedical 
and clinical information.

Using the Gene Ontology to Annotate Biomedical Journal Articles 
Michael Bada, Lawrence Hunter 
University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, USA 
Abstract 
We are creating a gold-standard corpus of manually 
annotated full-text biomedical journal articles 
toward natural-language-processing applications. 
Central to this is our use of entire ontologies of the 
Open Biomedical Ontologies initiative as well as 
other terminologies as term sources, in contrast to 
most other such annotation projects, which have used 
small, ad hoc schemas. In addition to the standard 
difficulties in such annotation projects, each of the 
terminologies we have used has idiosyncrasies and 
ambiguities that present further challenges to 
consistent, high-quality annotation of these articles. 
In this paper we present and discuss the most salient 
of these with regard to the Gene Ontology that we 
have encountered and addressed in our annotation 
guidelines and training. The utility of these 
guidelines can be seen in the high and still-
increasing interannotator-agreement statistics that 
we continually monitor. 
Introduction 
Gold-standard annotated biomedical corpora are 
essential for the training and evaluation of advanced 
biomedical 
natural-language-processing 
(NLP) 
systems, as evidenced by the significantly improved 
performance statistics of such systems trained on 
relevant corpora1,2. We have therefore embarked on 
an ambitious project to create a manually annotated 
corpus of full-text biomedical journal articles as a 
gold-standard community resource, which we are 
calling the CRAFT (Colorado Richly Annotated Full-
Text) Corpus. In addition to manually annotating 
full-text papers, we are using all terms of select 
ontologies of the Open Biomedical Ontologies 
(OBO) initiative3 (as well as other terminologies) as 
the annotating term sources, the first such effort of 
which we are aware. One part of this effort is 
annotation of these articles using the entire Gene 
Ontology (GO), which is comprised of terms 
representing biological processes (BP), molecular 
functions (MF), and cellular components (CC)4. 
In addition to the standard difficulties in this type of 
annotation 
project, 
our 
effort 
is 
particularly 
challenging due to our annotating full-text articles 
and using the full term sets of OBOs. Each of the 
terminologies 
we 
have 
used 
has 
its 
own 
idiosyncrasies and ambiguities that present further 
thus to text mining of these articles. In this paper we 
present and discuss the most salient of these issues 
that we have encountered in using the GO and 
addressed in our annotation guidelines and training. 
The utility of these guidelines can be seen in the high 
interannotator-agreement (IAA) statistics that we 
continually monitor. 
Methods 
Manual annotation is performed in an annotation tool 
developed within our lab called Knowtator5, which is 
implemented as a plugin to Protege-Frames6. In an 
effort to reduce the annotators' workloads, the articles 
were preprocessed by automatically tagging them 
with terms from the relevant ontology; the annotators 
then check these annotations, making any needed 
deletions or corrections, and mark up anything else 
that was missed by the preprocessing. All of the 
annotators' work is further reviewed by the project 
lead (MB), with subsequent corrections being made. 
All tagging is saved as standoff annotation. IAA was 
calculated by comparing one annotator's set of 
annotations with the set of annotations created as a 
result of the project lead's review of the set, and 
Knowtator was used to calculate IAA statistics. 
Though the GO is continually evolving and growing, 
we are using a single static version (dated November 
20, 2007, when this project was initiated) that 
contains 14,306 biological processes, 7,984 molecular 
functions, and 2,047 cellular components. 
Guidelines for Applying the GO toward NLP 
Annotation 
Given that we are using an ontology of more than 
24,000 terms to annotate biomedical journal articles 
and that we strive for high IAA statistics, clear, well-
conceived annotation guidelines are critical. Here we 
present the higher-level issues we have encountered 
and how we have addressed them in our guidelines. 
(We 
also 
have 
lower-level, 
linguistics-based 
guidelines, but this is outside the scope of this paper.) 
1. Rules for General Biological Processes 
We have found that general words indicating 
biological processes are particularly difficult to 
consistently annotate. For example:

humor secretion from the ciliary processes and 
challenges to consistent, high-quality annotation and

In (1), “formation” is closest to the biological-
process 
term 
biosynthetic 
process 
(which 
encompasses the building up of more complex 
molecules from simpler ones), while in (2), 
“formation” is closest to the term 
cellular 
component assembly, which includes assembly of 
protein complexes, as is the case here. Rules have 
helped greatly in the annotation of such general 
process words. For example, pertaining to the above 
examples, if lexical variants of “form”, “create”, 
“assemble”, etc. are applied to molecules, it is likely 
a biosynthetic process; if it is applied to cellular 
components, it is likely a cellular-component 
assembly. Annotating words denoting formation of 
cells 
and 
higher-level 
anatomical 
structures 
consistently is still difficult, as the GO cell and 
anatomical-structure development terms are arranged 
in a complicated (and some would say unintuitive) 
way. We plan on submitting our suggestions to the 
GO curation team toward making this part of the 
ontology clearer. 
2. Molecular Functions vs. Biological Processes 
The GO MF subontology is in a somewhat 
ambiguous state. The overwhelming majority of the 
MF terms are defined as molecular-level processes. 
(For example, the definition of binding is the 
“selective, often stoichiometric, interaction of a 
molecule with one or more specific sites on another 
molecule”.) Using the terminology of the Basic 
Formal Ontology (BFO), an upper-level ontology 
that is being used by members of the OBO 
Consortium toward evolution of the OBOs7, a 
molecular function in this view is an occurrent, i.e., a 
process, at the molecular level.  However, there are 
those within the OBO Consortium who assert that a 
GO molecular-function term denotes not a process 
but a proper function, which is a dependent 
continuant, i.e., an abstract entity that depends on the 
existence of another entity – essentially, the potential 
or functionality inherent in an entity to have a 
process realized3. It appears that the MF subontology 
will eventually evolve to this latter conceptualization. 
This is relevant to our annotation work because this 
dichotomy between a process and the functionality to 
effect a process will often be expressed differently in 
natural-language text and thus should be annotated 
differently. (However, passages are often ambiguous 
with regard to process or function.) We have taken 
the view that molecular functions are processes, 
partly because this is how they are mostly currently 
defined and partly because mentions of processes are 
more common and more straightforwardly indicated 
in natural language than are functions to effect 
processes and thus more easily annotated.  
A conflated issue is the fact that there are 
corresponding terms in the BP and MF subontologies 
that are extremely difficult to differentiate given a 
textual mention, even using their defintiions, e.g., BP 
signal transduction and MF signal transducer 
activity, BP regulation of transcription and 
MF 
transcription 
regulator 
activity, BP 
caspase activation and MF caspase activator 
activity, as well as many corresponding BP 
transport and MF transporter activity terms. We have 
mostly dealt with this thus far by using most of the 
MF terms only to annotate text matching the term 
itself or an exact synonym (e.g., kinase activity), an 
acceptably close synonym (e.g., kinase functionality), 
or the corresponding continuant (e.g., kinase, as 
discussed later in the paper). This is a suboptimal 
solution, but using the MF terms in this restricted 
way has allowed us to maintain our high levels of 
interannotator agreement. 
A merging of the current MF subontology into the BP 
subontology to create one ontology of occurrents, 
from molecular-level to organism-level, would go a 
long way in ameliorating these two interrelated 
issues. We realize that this may seem radical, but it 
has been considered before, e.g., at the 2008 NCBO 
Relation Ontology Expert Meeting8. We assert that 
this should involve merging the corresponding BP & 
MF term pairs such as those aforementioned. While 
the BP ontology would be an ontology of biological 
occurrents, the MF ontology could be redefined as an 
ontology of biological functions. An ontology of 
functions could likely be managed semiautomatically, 
as it would mostly mirror the relevant portions of the 
process ontology. 
3. Noncanonical, Pathological, and Ex Vivo 
Entities and Processes 
The GO is charged with representing canonical 
biological processes, molecular functions, and 
cellular components, and so we attempted at first to 
limit annotation to such canonical entities and 
processes. However, this turns out to be a deceptively 
difficult task. Sometimes the noncanonicality or 
pathology is explicit, as in: 
136

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) There were enlarged extracellular spaces between 
cells in the equatorial/bow region in 5 wk old 
alphaA/BKO lenses. [PMID:12546709] 
In (3), it is obvious that the extracellular spaces are 
noncanonical in that they are larger than normal. But 
many times the noncanonicality or pathology can 
only be inferred from a very careful reading and 
comprehension of the article, and many other times it 
is not at all clear. This is especially due to the fact 
that most biological articles involve experiments with 
organisms or components of organisms in which they 
are subjected to all sorts of procedures, substances, 
and 
environments 
they 
would 
not 
normally 
encounter. Our solution is to annotate all mentions of 
GO entities and processes, even those that are 
explicitly noncanonical or pathological (so long as all 
of the other rules are followed, of course). Thus, in 
(3), “extracellular spaces” is annotated with the GO 
CC term extracellular space even though they are 
noncanonical in terms of their sizes. 
A related issue is, given that the GO is in the domain 
of naturally occurring in vivo processes nd cellular 
entities, whether or not their ex vivo counterparts 
should be annotated. Analogously, to maximize our 
IAA, we decided to annotate all such ex vivo entities 
and processes; thus, a binding is a binding whether it 
takes place in an organism or in a beaker. 
Smith et al. have written of noncanonical anatomical 
parts, which, in their representation with the 
Ontology of Biomedical Reality, are siblings of 
canonical anatomical parts; both of these are 
subsumed by a superclass of anatomical structures9. 
We analogously are viewing the entities and 
processes of the GO as these more general concepts 
that encompass both canonical and noncanonical 
instances. 
4. Verb Nominalizations as Occurrents 
Verb nominalizations can refer to either occurrents or 
continuants; Simon and Smith have written of such 
duality of certain biomedical terms (e.g., dilation, 
dislocation) and how they address it in their 
LinKBase system10. As an example from our corpus: 
(4) The vesicle formation goes along with several 
other changes in the red blood cell like 
cytoskeleton rearrangements and changes in the 
phospholipid 
orientation 
in 
the 
cellular 
membrane. [PMID:12925238] 
In (4), “formation” clearly refers to a process, while 
“orientation” is a dependent continuant in that it is an 
attribute of the cellular membrane. We instruct our 
annotators to not annotate relevant mentions of such 
words if they clearly denote continuants since GO 
biological processes are occurrents. However, it is 
sometimes ambiguous whether such a relevant 
mention refers to either the occurrent or to the 
dependent continuant, e.g., “distribution” in: 
(5) The differentiation and distribution of specific 
mature neurons was examined in our previous 
study at adult stages with the expression of 
striatal markers such as preproenkephalin and 
Gad65/67. [PMID:15882092] 
In such a case where one of the possible readings 
denotes an occurrent, we instruct the annotator to 
mark up the mention. If we had an ontology of the 
corresponding dependent continuants, we would also 
mark up such a mention with the dependent 
continuant term, as we encourage multiple annotation 
to capture the ambiguity of the expression. 
Results 
At this stage of our annotation of our 97-article 
corpus, we have created 8,279 annotations of cellular 
components (which is completed) and 18,996 
annotations of molecular functions and biological 
processes in 44 articles (which is ongoing). (One 
annotator marked up articles with GO CC terms and 
another is annotating with GO BP and MF terms.) 
To demonstrate the utility of our guidelines, we 
present the IAAs (calculated approximately weekly) 
for our two GO annotation passes in Figure 1. The 
annotation of the cellular components quickly rose to 
approximately 90% or higher, while the annotation of 
the biological processes and molecular functions 
started very low (9.7%) but has significantly risen 
since, with the last few data points at approximately 
80%. There are large oscillations in the graph that are 
partly due to the fact that this annotator is typically 
able to annotate only one or two articles per period. A 
given article often has many mentions of a relatively 
small set of GO terms, and the IAA statistics are 
subject to such variation if the two annotators 
consistently annotate these numerous mentions of 
this relatively small set of GO terms differently. 
5. Continuants with Molecular Functions 
Mentions of continuants that have functions that can 
be realized in processes are often more frequent than 
the processes themselves; this is especially true for 
the molecular-function terms. For example, mentions 
of recombinases are more frequent than mentions of 
the MF term recombinase activity. We wished to 
capture these lexically analogous mentions, so each 
such mention is annotated with the corresponding 
term and also with the class continuant, the general 
term denoting an entity in the BFO. Thus, each such 
mention is doubly annotated as a process and as an 
137

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
entity. This is actually not semantically correct, as 
something cannot be both a continuant and an 
occurrent according to the BFO since these are 
disjoint classes in the BFO. It would be better to 
annotate each such mention once, as a continuant that 
has the corresponding function, i.e., by annotating as 
a continuant and then adding a restriction to it, but 
Knowtator is not currently capable of this type of 
representation. Nevertheless, our methodology enables 
us to capture all information that can then be easily 
transformed into a more semantically correct 
representation in our annotation repository.

Conclusions 
We have encountered issues in the course of our 
project to annotate biomedical journal articles with 
the whole of the GO, and we have attempted to 
address them with the guidelines presented in this 
article. These guidelines have in part allowed us to 
achieve high IAA statistics using the ontology as a 
very large annotation schema. We assert that these 
issues will also be troublesome for attempts at 
programmatic annotation and text mining of 
biomedical journal articles, which many see as 
necessary in the future. We have presented several 
suggestions to the GO that we believe could 
ameliorate these issues.

A Unified Ontological-Semantic Substrate  
for Physiological Simulation and Cognitive Modeling 
Sergei Nirenburg, Marjorie McShane, Stephen Beale 
University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA 
Abstract 
This paper briefly describes a system that provides a 
constructive proof of the versatility of ontologies and 
ontology-based knowledge resources. The Maryland 
Virtual Patient (MVP) environment models a team of 
automatic and human agents diagnosing and treating 
a virtual patient. It uses a uniform ontological 
substrate to support both the simulation of the world 
outside 
the 
cognitive 
agents 
– 
specifically, 
physiological processes in the “body” of the virtual 
patient – and perception, reasoning and action in 
the “minds” of the virtual patient and other 
intelligent agents.   
Introduction 
The term ontology has come to be used so broadly that 
calling a resource an ontology carries little information 
without further specification. Our ontology, work on 
which was started in the early 1980s, was initially 
intended as a substrate for natural language 
processing1. It has been recently extended to model a 
society of simulated embodied artificial intelligent 
agents in the Maryland Virtual Patient (MVP) 
environment2,3,4,5 (inter alia).§ The human agents play 
the roles of an attending physician and, optionally, a 
human mentor. The artificial agents play the roles of 
virtual patients (VPs) and additional members of a 
medical team, such as lab technicians and medical 
specialists. The environment also features an automatic 
tutor agent. The VP agent is at present the most fully 
developed and the most complex of the artificial 
agents. A core application of the MVP environment is 
to help teach medical students cognitive decision-
making skills in diagnosing and treating patients. To 
make this process as close as possible to the experience 
of treating humans, we have simulated both the 
patient’s “body” and its “mind.”  
The processes involved in the two kinds of 
simulation cover the VPs’ physiological processes; 
perception (interoceptive perception and language 
understanding); reasoning (including decision-making 
and memory-related operations); and action (physical, 
verbal and mental). All these processes are supported 
in the MVP environment by a single set of knowledge 
resources based on an ontology. In developing the 
MVP environment, our initial hypothesis was that the 
above processes could be modeled within a unified, 
knowledge-based paradigm. Our vested interest in 
seeing this hypothesis validated was the substantial 
economies we expected in the knowledge acquisition 
task. As it happens, the hypothesis was indeed 
constructively validated in the proof-of-concept MVP 
system, in which all the above processes have been 
implemented on the basis of a minimal extension of the 
OntoSem ontology, which was originally developed to 
support language understanding.   
The Ontology. The OntoSem ontology currently 
contains about 9,500 concepts – described using, on 
average, 16 properties each – which are divided among 
objects, events and properties. Most of the concepts are 
general-purpose, with the exception of several hundred 
from the medical domain that were added to support 
the 
MVP 
project. 
The 
ontology 
shares 
its 
metalanguage with two other knowledge bases: a 
lexicon and a language-independent fact repository. 
There is a many-to-one linking from the lexicon to the 
ontology, as descriptive specifications of lexical 
meaning are permitted.6 OntoSem’s metalanguage is 
unambiguous, which permits reasoning about language 
and the world to be carried out without the interference 
of lexical and morphosyntactic ambiguities.  
The Fact Repository. The distinction between 
descriptions and assertions, standard in AI and 
cognitive modeling, is the criterion for recording a 
knowledge element as an ontological concept (a 
description) or an ontological instance (an assertion, 
stored in the fact repository). This distinction proves 
useful in modeling all the processes necessary for 
supporting the MVP environment.  For example, the 
preferred mode of modeling language understanding in 
our approach is to use the OntoSem analyzer to 
generate disambiguated text-meaning representations 
(TMRs) from input texts, store the TMRs in the fact 
repository, then use the fact repository as a source of 
heuristics for all further processing, including 
subsequent language understanding itself. In other 
words, the fact repository both helps the processing of 
new texts and is augmented by semantic information 
obtained from those texts.  
A non-linguistic example of the use of the ontology 
vs. fact repository distinction is authoring libraries of 
specific MVPs on the basis of a “prototype” disease 
stored in the ontology.

Artificial Agent Capabilities in MVP 
Several types of processes in the MVP environment 
are supported by ontological representations of typical 
sequences of causally and temporally connected 
events, often referred to as causal chains, scripts or 
plans.7 
These 
processes 
include 
physiological 
simulation, the reasoning used for language analysis, 
and the reasoning used for decision-making. In this 
section we present brief examples in each of these 
domains to show how the ontology seamlessly ties 
together a complex multi-agent system.   
Physiological 
Simulation. 
Physiological 
simulation in the MVP environment is implemented 
using ontological representations of complex events. 
As an example, consider the  representation of the 
complex event 
SWALLOW. The 
SWALLOW script 
includes many subevents (muscles contracting, nerves 
firing), conditionals (food cannot pass if there is an 
obstruction), loops (peristalsis throughout the segments 
of the esophagus), and so on, this script is conceptually 
straightforward in that every event must occur in the 
order specified, given that its preconditions are met, 
with no optional or variously ordered events. (For lack 
of space, we show only a few of the dozens of 
subevents, omit variable bindings, local properties and 
property facet markers.)

(has-event-as-part  
    oropharyngeal-phase-of-swallowing  
esophageal-phase-of-swallowing))

    motion-event:mouth_to_pharynx

(motion-event:mouth_to_pharynx

…) 
A more complex type of physiological simulation-
supporting script is a disease script, which not only has 
more parameterizable features but can also be modified 
midstream 
by 
external 
factors, 
like 
medical 
interventions or changes in the person’s lifestyle.2,3 
Cognitive Capabilities. Viewed in a simplified 
manner, the cognitive capabilities of a VP are 
implemented as an infinite perception– decision-
making–action loop. In the MVP environment, the 
world that is perceived by the VP is constrained to its 
own body (interoception) and to its language-based 
interactions with the agents playing the roles of 
medical personnel. The VP’s reasoning covers not only 
goal-oriented decision making, it is also central to 
language analysis and generation. The VP’s actions 
include dialog-related verbal actions, manipulating the 
agenda of goals and plans, remembering events and 
facts, and a few physical events – such as presenting to 
the MD – that are not simulated in great detail at the 
moment. 
Modeling 
Perception 
I: 
Interoception. 
Interoception connects the “body” and the “mind” of 
the VP by signaling the agent’s becoming aware of a 
symptom (e.g., pain), understood as a side effect of its 
physiological state. Procedurally, the moment the VP 
perceives a symptom, the latter is added to its short-
term memory. This triggers the addition of an instance 
of the goal be-healthy onto the agenda, with the 
symptom as a parameter. What is important for this 
paper is that the ontologically grounded format in 
which symptoms are formulated is identical to that of 
text meaning representations (produced by the 
language analysis system) and elements of the fact 
repository. 
Modeling Perception II: Language. Many aspects 
of language processing – from disambiguation1 to 
paraphrase detection5 to reference resolution8 – can be 
supported by knowledge like that provided by the 
OntoSem ontology. For lack of space, we briefly 
discuss just one aspect of the OntoSem ontology – 
multivalued selectional restrictions – and two of the 
many types of language processing it permits. 
     (i) 
Resolution 
of 
type 
incongruity. 
Type 
incongruities are situations in which typical semantic 
constraints are not met: dogs can eat newspapers, even 
though the THEME case role of the ontological concept 
INGEST should be constrained to food or drink; parrots 
can speak, even though humans are the only full-
fledged agents of speaking; babies and dogs can earn 
money (e.g., as clothing models or in pet food ads), 
even though they are hardly typical agentive workers.

In cases where extensions of meaning can be foreseen, 
they can be encoded using multivalued selectional 
restrictions. In OntoSem, these are implemented using 
facets of property values, which reflect the different 
confidence levels in semantic decisions. Thus, the 
INSTRUMENT case role of the event PAY can be 
constrained to MONEY on the DEFAULT facet, but also 
license GOODS on the SEM facet and SERVICE on the 
RELAXABLE-TO facet. Of course, many such extended 
meanings cannot be anticipated and must be processed 
using runtime reasoning, which is an ongoing line of 
work in OntoSem. 
(ii) Reference resolution. Among the most difficult 
aspects of reference resolution is selecting the most 
appropriate antecedent from among a list of candidates 
when the standard non-semantic heuristics fail to come 
up with a strong preference. Multivalued selectional 
restrictions can sometimes cast a deciding vote. For 
example, whereas the typical agent of a surgical 
procedure is a surgeon, any doctor – or, in a pinch, any 
person – can perform some types of surgery. If a text 
included a sentence like He botched the surgery, and if 
there were several potential antecedents for he that had 
similar non-semantic scores, any candidate known to 
be a surgeon should be preferred; barring that, 
anybody known to be a physician, though not known 
to be a surgeon, should be preferred; and barring this, 
any human, not known to be either a physician or a 
surgeon, should be preferred (this example is 
simplified to save space; the actual combination of 
heuristic evidence is much more complex). The 
relevant ontological concept (once again, simplified) 
is: 
PERFORM-SURGERY

Whereas the facets SEM, DEFAULT and RELAXABLE-TO 
are used in the ontology, the fact repository uses the 
facet VALUE whose semantics is that of actuality, not 
typicality.  
Modeling the VP’s Decision Making. When 
making decisions, the VP uses both knowledge it is 
aware of and knowledge that it might not be expressly 
aware of. The kinds of conscious knowledge that the 
VP uses for making decisions are: (a) an inventory of 
ontologically grounded goals and an inventory of plans 
that the VP knows are instrumental in attaining a 
particular goal; (b) information about the VP’s 
physiological state, particularly the intensity and 
frequency of symptoms, as perceived via interoception 
and remembered in its memory; (c) information 
available to the VP about certain properties of tests and 
treatments for its condition: pain, unpleasantness, risk 
and effectiveness; if this information is not available to 
the VP, the VP has the option of activating a plan of 
determining the values for these parameters; in the 
current implementation, this involves asking questions 
of the agent playing the role of attending physician; 
and (d) two time-related parameters: the follow-up­
date, i.e., the time the doctor told the patient to come 
for a follow-up, and the current-time of the given 
interaction. The largely subconscious traits the VP uses 
in decision-making are: (a) character traits like trust, 
suggestibility 
and 
courage; 
and 
(b) 
certain 
physiological traits, like physiological-resistance (e.g., 
how well the MVP tolerates chemotherapy), pain-
threshold (how much pain the MVP can tolerate) and 
the ability-to-tolerate-symptoms (how intense or 
frequent symptoms have to be before the MVP feels 
the need to do something about them).4 
Discussion 
Much recent work on ontology has been devoted to 
compiling “ontologies” – under any definition of the 
word – as quickly and inexpensively as possible. Most 
such efforts exploit machine learning techniques and, 
as would be expected, produce noisy results that are 
useful for some applications but will certainly not 
support simulation or high-level reasoning by an 
advanced, conversational intelligent agent. In this 
paper we have attempted to show that keeping human 
acquirers (largely) out of the loop is not the only way 
to 
keep 
ontology 
development 
from 
being 
prohibitively expensive. Another way is to manually or 
semi-automatically create resources but reuse them 
across modules of an environment. In the case of MVP, 
the physiological, general cognitive and language 
processing capabilities of all the agents rely on the 
same ontological substrate, the same organization of 
the fact repository (agent memory) and the same 
format of knowledge representation. This uniformity 
not only provides significant savings in development, 
testing and debugging time, it also facilitates 
interoperability. 
The 
MVP 
system 
provides 
a 
constructive proof of the versatility of ontologies and 
ontology-based knowledge resources. 
Naturally, when starting to develop our first medical 
application we sought domain-specific ontologies that 
might be incorporated into our general purpose 
ontology. Two large and well-known resources are 
MeSH, the National Library of Medicine’s (NLM’s) 
tree 
of 
medical 
subject 
headings, 
arranged 
hierarchically, and Metathesaurus, NLM’s ontology of 
hundreds of thousands of medical terms along with 
their synonyms and morphological variants (hereafter 
referred to together as M/M). These resources overlap 
in part (MeSH being much smaller) and use the 
same concept 
identifiers 
(CUIs).9 
After 
experimentation with these resources – which reflects

the best understanding of them we could acquire in a 
limited time – we concluded that importation would 
not benefit our system for the following reasons: (a) 
M/M is geared toward the needs of library science, not 
having the semantic precision to support high-level 
reasoning by artificial agents; (b) the content is English 
terms, including all synonyms, which introduces the 
language 
issues 
that 
our 
language-independent 
ontology avoids; (c) there are very few properties, and 
61% of properties (at the time of our experiment, in 
2005) had no properties at all; (d) there is no division 
of concepts and instances; (e) the is-a relation is not 
interpreted as strictly in M/M as in OntoSem: e.g., in 
the 
following 
are 
all 
siblings: Gait; 
Lower 
extremity pain walking; Lower limb length difference; 
Barefoot walking; and Extensor thrust10; (f) many 
concepts in M/M contain a very large set of parents – 
i.e., 651,000 have one or two parents but another 
30,000 have 3 or more parents, with the following 
reckoning (number of concepts: number of parents): 
17075:3, 6787:4, 3434:5, 1907:6, 1203:7, 715:8, 
432:9, 1,000:>=10. As mentioned earlier, many of 
these “parents” are not parents in the narrow sense of 
the term used in OntoSem but, instead, concepts 
related in some unspecified way: e.g., of the 38 
root nodes of the hierarchy, a number are sources of 
information, like SNOMED Intl. 1998 and Medical 
Entities Dictionary; (g) the physicians collaborating in 
the work found the content too noisy to be helpful; 
and, as would be expected of any large resource, (g) 
there are many errors that would need to be cleaned 
manually to keep our ontology to its current standard: 
e.g., over 14,000 concepts are parents of themselves. 
In terms of utility to our ontology, the UMLS resources 
have a similar status as WordNet11 has for building our 
lexicon: acquirers can use them to provide ideas for 
resource development, but no automatic, full-blown 
incorporation can be usefully carried out. 
There is, however, one resource that has been very 
useful in our work: the Foundational Model of 
Anatomy (FMA)12. FMA provides both inheritance (is­
a) and meronymic (part-of) trees for elements of 
human anatomy, as well as a number of other 
properties like distal to/proximal to, has mass, and so 
on. The names of concepts are English terms. 
Synonyms and some foreign language equivalents are 
included, but they are linked to the “preferred term,” 
making this truly an ontology rather than a word net. In 
supplementing the OntoSem ontology for use in the 
medical domain, we are consulting the FMA model 
because, first, it represents a fine organization of 
anatomical concepts and, second, we aim to keep our 
knowledge resources compatible with what we believe 
will become the accepted standard. However, it would 
be incorrect to assume that FMA answers all our needs 
in the medical domain: it treats only anatomical 
objects, whereas we need a full treatment of relevant 
events and their relationship to objects, both 
anatomical and extra-anatomical. In addition, as might 
be expected, our collaborating doctors do not agree 
with all of the decisions of the FMA developers with 
respect to the specific needs of our environment.

Abstract 
We describe an approach to characterize genes or 
phenotypes via ontology fingerprints which are 
composed 
of 
Gene 
Ontology 
(GO) 
terms 
overrepresented among those PubMed abstracts 
linked to the genes or phenotypes. We then quantify 
the 
biological 
relevance 
between 
genes 
and 
phenotypes by comparing their ontology fingerprints 
to calculate a similarity score. We validated this 
approach by correctly identifying genes belong to 
their biological pathways with high accuracy, and 
applied this approach to evaluate GWA study by 
ranking 
genes 
associated 
with 
the 
lipid 
concentrations in plasma as well as to prioritize 
genes within linkage disequilibrium (LD) block. We 
found that the genes with highest scores were: 
ABCA1, LPL, and CETP for HDL; LDLR, APOE and 
APOB for LDL; and LPL, APOA1 and APOB for 
triglyceride. In addition, we identified some top 
ranked genes linking to lipid metabolism from the 
literature even in cases where such knowledge was 
not reflected in current annotation of these genes. 
These results demonstrate that ontology fingerprints 
can be used effectively to prioritize genes from GWA 
studies for experimental validation. 
Introduction 
Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have 
become a feasible and important method to identify 
loci that are associated with a particular phenotype1. 
Assessing quantitatively the likely importance of 
genes identified as significant to disease risk based 
on biological facts is essential to proceed efficiently 
toward experimental validation processes and, 
ultimately, to define the causal relationships between 
genes and phenotypes. 
Various text-mining methods have been developed to 
extract information from the biomedical literature for 
gene annotation2-5. In addition, GO provides a 
standardized characterization of gene functions6. 
Despite the fact that biomedical literatures were 
written without GO in mind, it has been shown that 
GO terms that can be identified in PubMed abstracts 
tend to occur frequently in the literature7. Therefore, 
GO as a standardized terminology provides a 
semantic grounding to mine the PubMed literature.  
Here 
we 
describe 
a 
comprehensive 
analysis 
combining text mining of PubMed abstracts and GO 
with quantitative measure to assemble ontology 
fingerprints for genes and phenotypes, and a method 
to calculate a similarity score between two ontology 
fingerprints. We further describe how comparing the 
ontology fingerprints of a phenotype with that of 
genes identified in a GWA study can be used to 
prioritize genes for follow-up investigation, including 
fine mapping and functional studies. 
Methods 
Data 
We used the June 13, 2007 version of GO and 2007 
version of PubMed abstracts for this study. The 
PubMed abstracts and the genes annotated were 
obtained from the NCBI "pubmed2gene" file. 
Abstracts that contained GO terms were also 
annotated by mapping each term to the abstracts 
using exact string match. Since GO is a Directed 
Acyclic Graph (DAG)6, abstracts containing a GO 
term were also labeled with all the parents of that GO 
term in the GO hierarchy as well. In addition, each 
abstract was labeled with a GO term only once 
regardless of how many times the term occurred. 
Because we were attempting to decipher human 
gene-phenotype 
relationships, 
the 
ontology 
fingerprints were derived from abstracts linked to 
human genes. In total, we retrieved 178,687 
abstracts, and we constructed ontology fingerprints 
for all 25,357 human genes. There were 5,001 
ontology terms that mapped to PubMed abstracts 
linked to human genes.  
Enrichment Test 
To test whether a GO term appeared more often in 
PubMed abstracts linked to a gene than in the rest of 
the PubMed abstracts linked to other human genes, 
we performed a hypergeometric test, resulting in a 
list of GO terms with p-values for each gene. Due to

the discreteness of the hypergeometric distribution, 
the mid p-value was used in the calculation8: 
Equation 1 
For each gene and ontology pair, A  is the total 
T 
number of abstracts considered, while AO  and A
G 
denotes the number of abstracts linked to the 
ontology term and gene respectively; number of 
abstracts that linked to both the ontology term and 
the gene is labeled as e . A  is the random variable 
obs 
of observing the number of abstracts linked to both 
the ontology term and the gene. The p-value was then 
adjusted to remove insignificant GO terms (See 
Supplementary information for details). 
We also performed the same test on each phenotype-
ontology pair. While each gene or phenotype has a 
list 
of 
ontology 
terms 
serving 
as 
ontology 
fingerprints defined as ontology terms with p-value 
<1, collectively the terms and the quantification 
reflect the characteristics of the gene or phenotype. 
Similarity Score Calculation 
The ontology fingerprint characterizes the cellular 
component, molecular function, or biological process 
of a gene or a phenotype with a quantitative measure. 
By comparing how similar the ontology fingerprints 
between a gene and a phenotype are, we can infer to 
what extent a gene may be related to the phenotype. 
We calculate a similarity score using a modified 
version of the inner product: 
Equation2 
i =1, 2,..., O  represents the ontology terms, and the rij
i
th
and qi  represent the adjusted p-values of the 
ontology term of the gene j and the phenotype term, 
respectively. We 
took the logarithm of the 
probabilities 
to 
prevent 
underflow 
during 
computation. In the numerator, ontology terms that 
have adjusted p-values equal 1.0 for either the gene 
or phenotype (i.e. not in either of the gene’s or 
phenotype’s fingerprint) will have a score of zero for 
that ontology term i , and thus make no contribution. 
Each similarity score is then normalized by 
O I q
( 
< 1)
 
(
 
I r  = 1)
 
, which is the number of ontology 
∑ i=1 
i
 ij
 
terms in the fingerprint of the phenotype but not in 
that of gene j . The normalization intends to give 
more weight on a gene’s ontology fingerprint that has 
a higher degree of overlapping terms with the 
phenotype’s ontology fingerprint. If all of the 
ontology terms of a phenotype overlap with those of 
a gene, 1 is used in the denominator. Note from 
Equation 2 that an ontology term with low adjusted 
p-values for both the phenotype and the gene would 
contribute significantly to the similarity score. 
Therefore, the equation considers both the number of 
GO terms in the ontology fingerprints and the 
significance level indicated by the p-value. A p-value 
threshold ( λ ) was selected and applied to calculate 
similarity score between genes and phenotypes (See 
Supplementary information for detail). 
Significant Genes Identified from GWA Study  
We applied our approach to a GWA study that 
investigated the influences of loci on lipid 
concentrations, HDL, LDL, and triglyceride9. Genes 
within or overlap with the top linkage disequilibrium 
(LD) blocks of best SNPs for each trait were 
obtained as significantly associated with the 
corresponding trait (top 199, 201 and 200 LD blocks 
for LDL, HDL and TG respectively). Independent 
loci were defined as having low correlation (r2 < 0.2) 
with any other higher ranking SNP. The p-value of 
the most significant SNP within each block was used.  
Results 
Ontology Fingerprints 
We computed the association of genes or phenotypes 
with GO terms by using the hypergeometric 
enrichment test. The p-values from the test (raw p-
values) were then adjusted, taking into consideration 
the number of ontology terms associated with the 
genes or phenotypes. The purpose of the adjustment 
was to reduce the impact of insignificant ontology 
terms on the ontology fingerprints of genes or 
phenotypes that have been extensively studied. The 
resulting ontology terms with adjusted p-values 
collectively served as the ontology fingerprint for the 
gene or phenotype, with the p-value for each term 
reflecting the significance of the term’s enrichment 
among the abstracts associated with the gene or 
phenotype. Only terms with adjusted p-values < 1.0 
were used to define the ontology fingerprints for the 
gene or phenotype. Table 1 illustrates a small portion 
of the ontology fingerprint for the gene VEGFA, 
which encodes vascular endothelial growth factor A. 
This ontology fingerprint serves as a comprehensive, 
quantitative characterization of the gene using well-
defined ontology terms.

Similarity Scores between Genes and Phenotypes 
By comparing the genes’ and phenotypes’ ontology 
fingerprints, we calculated similarity scores to 
quantify the relevance of particular genes to 
phenotypes. We tested our approach by using 10 
randomly selected KEGG pathways as phenotype 
domains for evaluation. The AUCs for the 10 
pathways are shown in Table 2 (column “Ontology 
Fingerprint AUC”). We compared our approach to a 
similar text-mining approach which uses "concept 
profiles" to evaluate the association between different 
biological concepts10. Table 2 shows how well the 
ontology fingerprint approach and this Anni 2.0 
system 
correctly associated genes with their 
corresponding KEGG pathways. Specifically, our 
ontology fingerprint-based method has higher AUC 
for associating genes with their corresponding 
pathways than Anni 2.0. 1. We attribute such 
significant improvement to the employment of Gene 
Ontology, a well-developed controlled vocabulary to 
characterize the biological features of genes and 
phenotypes, the hypergeometric test, which highly 
increases the sensitivity for detecting the associated 
ontology terms, and our scoring method, which 
emphasizes on the number of ontology terms 
characterizing both the gene and the phenotype.  
Using Ontology Fingerprints to Prioritize Genes 
from GWA Studies 
We applied our method to evaluate the results from a 
GWA analysis9 studying the genetic variants 
influencing plasma lipid concentrations, including 
High-density 
lipoprotein 
(HDL), 
Low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL), and Triglyceride (TG). Among 
genes strong associations with lipid concentration, 
many are not clearly identified in their annotation as 
being relevant to lipid metabolism. Within the top-
ranked genes are quite a few well-known cholesterol 
related genes, including cholesterol ester transfer 
protein, plasma (CETP), low density lipoprotein 
receptor (LDLR), lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Simply 
based on the gene annotations alone, there are 10, 8, 
and 12 genes related to the lipid mechanism among 
the top 20 genes with highest similarity scores. For 
the remaining genes that do not have Entrez Gene 
annotation to be associated with the lipid metabolism, 
we found that there are additional 3, 9 and 7 genes 
that could potentially influence the HDL, LDL and 
TG concentrations respectively by tracing back to the 
GO terms and the literatures that contributed to the 
similarity scores. One example is transferrin (TF), 
which is ranked by the similarity score among the top 
20 genes for HDL. While current annotation of TF 
does not show any relevance to lipid or lipid 
metabolism, we found that Cubilin (CUBN), an 
endocytic receptor, can act as a receptor for both 
transferrin and apolipoprotein A111. Another example 
is thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB). THRB was 
found to negatively regulate the lipoprotein lipase 
inhibitor12, and the agonist of THRB is associated 
with a decrease of triglyceride concentration in 
rats13,14. Neither the relationship of THRB to nor its 
influence on the concentration of triglycerides in 
humans is established, so the annotation for this gene 
shows no direct link to lipid metabolism. Our results 
indicate that the ontology fingerprint method can 
identify genes relevant to the phenotypes revealed 
through GWA study (The top 20 ranked genes are 
listed in supplementary Table 2).

Conclusion 
Even though several text mining approaches have 
been developed to identify relationships between 
genes and phenotypes, our approach is significantly 
different in several aspects: 1) a hypergeometric 
enrichment test was used to focus on identifying 
overrepresented ontology terms for genes and 
phenotypes in relevant PubMed abstracts; 2) 
ontology fingerprints with quantitative measures, 
rather than individual ontology term annotations, 
were used to capture comprehensive characteristics 
of genes and phenotypes; 3) a method to calculate 
similarity scores between ontology fingerprints 
evaluated 
the 
relevance 
between 
genes 
and 
phenotypes.

Abstract 
Creation of an ontology according to some common 
plan is best accomplished collaboratively. This is 
sometimes contradicted by the distribution of the 
ontology’s developers. An obvious solution therefore 
is to build collaboration into ontology development 
tools. Such support necessarily includes both the 
technical means to perform editing operations upon 
an ontology, but also support for the communication 
that makes collaboration such a vital part of much 
ontology development. To investigate the distributed, 
collaborative ontology engineering process and the 
corresponding capabilities of the Collaborative 
Protege 3 (CP) tool, members of the OntoGenesis 
network came together and enriched the Ontology of 
Biomedical Investigations (OBI) with new content. 
The communications and interactions of the 
participants with each other, directly or through the 
tool, were tracked and analyzed. Our initial analysis 
of the degree to which this new tool fulfills the 
practical requirements of collaborative ontology 
engineering suggests the approach is promising. We 
present some observations and recommendations for 
CP based upon this experience.  
Introduction 
Engineering ontologies that are representative of a 
community consensus is of great interest to those 
working in bioinformatics and often requires close 
collaboration. Yet, the process of developing such 
ontologies often requires collaboration by many 
people in distributed geographical regions. There are 
a number of important requirements for ontology 
development tools that cope with the contradiction of 
the need for close collaboration and the distribution 
of developers1. Firstly, concurrent ontology editing, 
the ability for multiple edits to be made to the 
ontology at a single time and from different 
computers. Secondly, tracking annotations (called 
'notes' in CP) associated with corresponding 
representational units (RUs). Thirdly, tracking 
annotations associated with actions of ontology 
change, such as deletions, axiom edits and annotation 
edits. Fourthly, a manageable mechanism for 
discussion threads and instant messaging for online 
editors that satisfy the need for communication 
between 
ontology 
developers 
that 
makes 
collaborative ontology building so useful. 
The new Collaborative Protégé (CP) plugin2 for the 
widely used open-source ontology editing tool 
Protégé 3, claims to support the above features. CP 
enables concurrent editing of a single OWL file. The 
tool also features notes on RUs, a change tracking 
log for RUs (such as class edits), a discussion thread 
and an instant messaging client for real time chat. 
The tool captures changes, notes and discussions as 
instances of an integrated Change and Annotation 
Ontology (ChAO), thereby providing an audit trail of 
edits and decision making. This tool, therefore 
appears an appropriate choice for an evaluation of 
collaborative ontology engineering and we present an 
initial investigation into its use. 
Materials and Methods 
Thirteen members of the OntoGenesis Network came 
together at the European Bioinformatics Institute 
(EBI) for the 7th OntoGenesis Meeting (website: 
http://ontogenesis.ontonet.org/moin/NetworkMeeting 
7). The instrument branch of the ontology of 
biomedical investigation (OBI, http://obi.sourceforge.net), 
an OWL-DL ontology for the annotation of the 
biomedical laboratory workflow, was enriched with 
new classes and relations needed to describe 
instruments. The instrument branch was chosen 
because it represents an area of daily experience upon 
which a broad range of biologists, such as is present 
in the OntoGenesis Network, have something valid to 
contribute. The Obi.owl file was populated with new 
device classes and functions a) coming from the 
domains of the OntoGenesis members and b) as taken 
from a list provided by the Metabolomics Standard 
Initiative (http://msi-ontology.sourceforge.net/). The 
development followed the methodology adopted by 
the OBI developers 
http://obi.sourceforge.net/ontologyInformation/index. 
php#designPrinciples).  
Our methodology involved the following set of tasks: 
Familiarization: Users had an initial familiarization 
with Collaborative Protégé 3.4, its GUI and 
collaborative features.

Ad hoc additions: Development of attendee's own 
lists of devices and concomitant functions. This 
essentially required the addition of new classes as 
children of the OBI device class and the OBI 
function class. This also meant that there was a 
possibility of duplication, i.e. addition of the same 
device by 2 different editors, as the edits were made 
concurrently. 
Controlled additions: Placement of selected device 
classes from the MSI term list into OBI. The 
appropriate metadata required by OBI were also 
added. 
‘Agent Provocateur’: During a specified time period 
known only to organizer, an Agent Provocateur 
added conflicting and deliberately incorrect content 
to the ontology. This was used to assess the 
transparency of the changes occurring to the other 
online editors. 
Controlled Communication: Communication was 
restricted to specified channels during each editing 
session in order to evaluate CPs ability to foster 
communication, i.e. via notes, discussion threads and 
chat. 
Initially, development occurred in a single group but 
was then divided into two groups. Ad hoc additions 
were made, where editors were able to add and edit 
classes as they saw appropriate. Participants were 
then further divided in 4 pairs of 2, which then 
tackled different subsets of the MSI device term list. 
Each pair picked new terms from the list and added 
them to OBI with discussion. Then the results of the 
pairs were reviewed and commented by other pairs 
adding annotations. After more MSI terms were 
added by the whole group, first the chat was used to 
comment, annotate and discuss these additions. Then 
they were discussed by voice only and after that by 
chat and voice together. During the latter stages of 
this session, the Agent Provocateur user was 
deployed. 
Results 
Editing the Ontology 
The complete editing metrics, together with tables, 
diagrams and deeper discussions, can be found in the 
supplementary material accessible from the 7th 
OntoGenesis Meeting website. 
The OBI file grew 4.3% over the meeting course, 
whereby the increase in added defined classes 
(10.2%) was nearly double that of primitive classes 
(4.8%). Three new object properties were created 
during the meeting. These were used in a total of 68 
new existential restrictions (9.7% increase). By 
inspection, increased chat indicates increased editing 
activity 
(see Table 
2 
of 
the 
supplementary 
information). The data also show different users 
working on different parts of the ontology and on 
different RU types. Apparent roles of users differed, 
e.g. ‘moderators’ creating tasks for others, which 
showed up in the metrics. 
The lack of a RU and module locking mechanism 
meant there was no way to temporarily prevent others 
from altering classes that have a logical impact on the 
class under current definition. If a highly nested class 
description is created, it is difficult to get it right, 
unless others are prevented from changing something 
higher up in the hierarchy that will contradict the 
definition currently worked upon. Another method 
would be to just highlight areas that are currently 
worked on according to a colour scheme identifying 
the users, which then could resolve this by chat. 
Checking for duplicate class and property labels and 
notification of the users would be useful. If two users 
added the same class concurrently, there was no 
notification after the duplication had occurred.  
Priority has to be the undoing of deleted classes, 
because this can occur accidentally very easily in 
Protégé, e.g. by a single wrong click on the delete 
button or by accidentally moving classes. A roll back 
function would aid in conflict resolution and would 
lead to a safer editing. Undo/redo functionalities 
would be another feature to help users to prevent 
conflicts. Some non-deprecated properties were 
found to be sub-properties of deprecated properties, 
which seemed odd. Since currently there is also no 
global change list, it is impossible to see changes and 
annotations on deleted entities. If a parent class is 
deleted, all of its annotations disappear, including all 
children. The annotations will still be there, but since 
the association to the annotated RU is done via the 
ID only, without the label it is difficult to know what 
was annotated.  
Subscription and Notification of changes was 
requested, where users subscribe to certain areas of 
interest within the ontology and are then notified of 
any changes that occur to those areas. Getting 
notified on changes chosen by a user, such as 
discussion threads or certain RUs, would help to stay 
up to date and proceed faster in conflict resolution. 
For example warnings and alerts could be passed to 
subsets of users to prevent duplicate or contradicting 
editings. A ‘change view’ on selected items that are 
on a watch list would help users to keep track on 
recent 
developments 
in 
their 
interest 
or 
responsibility-domain. A feed of all classes could be 
used to notify developers to subscribed classes. For

the annotation flag in the class hierarchy it would be 
practical to see when someone added some new 
annotation, e.g. the annotation flag should then get an 
exclamation mark, or blink, or should display an 
analog bar that indicates the amount of attached 
annotations (a measure of topic-hotness). 
Versioning 
A side benefit of using a real time collaborative 
approach is that complicated versioning strategies are 
not needed: SVN change track and diff functions are 
not feasible for OWL files. Using SVN the threshold 
to do minor changes can be increased on the user 
side, because a complicated merge back and conflict 
resolution needs to be carried out on the whole 
artifact level, even when logically non-conflicting 
changes were made. However, even when SVN is 
used, the change track captured in the ChAO 
knowledge base (KB), can be copied and distributed 
in some SVN log after updating owl files. One 
drawback here is that small changes result in a 
textual information overkill: For a human readable 
change history, the tool should just state ‘class x was 
moved from A to B’, instead of listing all involved 
quantum changes, e.g. ‘class x was deleted from A’, 
‘class x was created under B’, …. Users would like 
the changes to be described in a high level 
abstraction, rather than overly granular. 
Annotations on RUs with Entity Notes 
Due to its abundant connotation with owl annotation 
properties, the term “annotations” as used in the CP 
GUI caused some initial confusion. Consequently, 
the “Annotations Tab” has now been re-labeled to 
“Entity Notes” which is clearer and more specific. 
“Discussion 
Threads” 
has 
been 
renamed 
to 
“Ontology notes” correspondingly. Unfortunately 
these name changes are now out of sync with the 
nomenclature used in the ChAO ontology.  
Each annotation has a freetext subject field to fill in 
as well as its freetext value. For the majority of small 
annotations, it turned out that people did not use the 
subject heading, potentially because they felt to 
provide an annotation type, subject heading and 
value for small annotations is overkill. Seeing the 
annotations in a table view, e.g. sorted according to 
type, subject and value would make viewing easier. 
Axiom annotations, as being currently investigated 
for OWL2, were requested by some users as well. 
The group observed that, to avoid information 
overload and to keep quality up, users should be 
allowed to remove their unintended annotations e.g. 
for the first 5 min of their creation.  
Detailed statistics on numbers and kinds of 
annotations made during the sessions are available in 
a spreadsheet and diagrams in the supplementary 
material. 
We positively note that in cases where the present 
(meta-) annotations are not sufficiently granular, the 
annotation types in CP’s underlying ChAO can be 
expanded with new annotation types that suit special 
projects needs and evaluation approaches. 
Search and filtering of user annotations: It is possible 
to filter by author, annotation text, annotation type or 
by creation date, alone or in logical combinations. 
Own metadata schemes, e.g. certain obi annotation 
properties 
like 
has_curation_status 
or 
definition_source, can be queried for by the 
queries tab. 
Communication 
In the beginning, threads and notes were misused for 
chats and vice versa, the latter due to the chats' 
instant visibility and notification. Once a topic had 
started, it seemed to be difficult to find a cut off, 
when to move from a chat into an RU note or thread 
and vice versa. A good example of the consequence 
of not using the right modality for annotations was, 
when a participant warned the group about an 
obsolete property (is_device_for) in the threads and 
not in the more appropriate entity note for the object 
property RU. As a consequence it was found that 
nonetheless a warning had been issued, people used 
this obsolete property. 
Chats were used for general acute issues and 
planning, e.g. “vote being held on @'http://purl.obo 
foundry.org/obo/Class_44”. Chats were requested to 
be linked with specific RUs and axioms to aid a more 
immediate and direct conflict resolution and not 
overload the (persistent) entity notes. A closed 'retreat 
room' was desired as well as a filter function on user 
names to enable to see only the chats of certain 
people or on particular ontology fragments. 
The integration of emoticons in text fields could 
increase transmittance of pragmatic aspects of 
communications and would aid in the prevention of 
tensions on a sociologic level, i.e. allowing irony to 
be expressed. 
Integrated voting on change issues, proved to be not 
fully implemented, but was needed by users. A 
mechanism that changes the ontology automatically 
149

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could increase KB development time and could be 
implemented 
using 
ChAO 
information 
and 
formalized voting outcomes. 
Issue tracker functions were requested, i.e. a scratch 
pad or todo list that can be worked through and 
‘checked’, e.g. indicating a proposed plan and what 
has been already realized at a certain time point. E.g. 
when people add new classes from a spreadsheet they 
should have a checklist that indicates which class has 
already been taken care of. 
Performance 
Overall, the performance of CP was very usable and 
much can be done with configuration to optimize it 
further. In large artifacts, expanding the full class 
hierarchy at once for the first time in one client can 
take its time (ca. 20 sec in our setup). Also opening a 
class with many direct subclasses for the first time 
will slow down and impair performance initially. 
Discussion and annotation update throughout the 
clients was so slow, that it led people to use the chat 
functionality, which was updated and immediately 
visible. To see an Annotation update, people needed 
to change a frame and only then was the GUI 
updated. This bug has since been rectified by the 
protégé team. 
Conclusion 
In this investigation, a realistic collaborative 
ontology building session was created using CP and 
its features were thoroughly tested. Areas where user 
requirements 
were 
not 
fulfilled 
have 
been 
highlighted. Although some caveats persist and some 
requirements could not be fulfilled at this time, it 
became clear that the CP tool is now in an advanced 
stage and can be used in practice with sufficient 
stability. It copes with complicated setups and is 
flexible 
enough 
to 
allow 
for 
corresponding 
adjustments.  
From an overall technical point of view, collaborative 
ontology building was relatively trouble free. The 
main area for improvement comes from the need for 
more sophisticated communication mechanisms. In 
editing, a mechanism for conflict resolution, e.g. 
'undo/redo' is needed, as well as some transaction 
management. Although crucial to editing in a 
collaborative, concurrent, real-time fashion, this is 
not presently available in CP. Some enhancement of 
editing functionality and the addition of notifications 
on changes to notes and threads was deemed 
necessary. The addition of chats to specific RUs and 
for specific groups would enhance annotation 
traceability of the tool further. In all, CP as it stands 
now is already usable as a collaborative tool that we 
can recommend. Our analysis provoked much 
feedback to the CP developers, and will be valuable 
for the CP version of P4, which is currently in 
preparation. Further use of CP in controlled settings 
will enable us to acquire further insights into the 
process of tool-based collaborative ontology building 
and such findings will be fed back to tool 
development in the future.

Abstract 
The developers of the Ontology of Biomedical 
Investigations (OBI) primarily use Protégé1 for 
editing. However, adding many classes with similar 
patterns of logical definition is time consuming, error 
prone, and requires the editor to have some expertise 
in OWL. Therefore, the process is poorly suited for a 
large number of domain experts who have limited 
experience Protégé and ontology development. We 
have developed a procedure to ease this task and 
allow such domain experts to add terms to the 
ontology in a way that both effectively includes 
complex logical definitions yet requires minimal 
manual intervention by OBI developers. The 
procedure is based on editing a Quick Term Template 
in a spreadsheet format which is subsequently 
converted into an OWL file. This procedure promises 
to be a robust and scalable approach for ontology 
enrichment. 
Introduction 
The Ontology of Biomedical Investigation2 (OBI) 
project is developing an integrated ontology for the 
description of biomedical investigations based on the 
requirements 
of 
a 
diverse 
set 
of 
scientific 
communities. Briefly, OBI’s development process is 
as follows: First, we selected the Basic Formal 
Ontology (BFO)3 and the Relation Ontology (RO)4 to 
provide basic organizational cues and a formal 
framework for representation. Collection of case 
studies and solicitation of term submissions are used 
to select candidates for inclusion in the ontology. A 
variety of techniques, including card sorting 
exercises, frequent teleconferences, and biannual 
meetings are used to develop entity definitions which 
are subsequently categorized along BFO’s 3 main 
axes, namely processes, independent continuants and 
dependent continuants. This classification helps 
ensure that terms are placed in a correct is_a 
hierarchy. In order to represent more complex 
artifacts, OWL restrictions are expressed in term of 
RO relations between OBI defined entities and those 
defined in partner ontologies from the OBO foundry5. 
In combination with the creation of ‘defined classes’ 
which 
have 
logical 
necessary 
and 
sufficient 
definitions, a complex, expressive and logically 
rigorous class hierarchy is constructed that can be 
practically maintained and validated by reasoners 
such as Pellet6 and FaCT7. 
A fundamental disadvantage of the process outlined 
above is that it does not scale well. Thousands of 
community term requests are already in the pipeline 
of the OBI project. Logical definitions are required 
by most of these terms in order to position them 
properly in the OBI hierarchy. Manually adding these 
classes and restrictions is time-consuming, error 
prone, and significantly limits the number of people 
who can contribute productively to enriching the 
ontology. 
Our Quick Terms proposal is motivated by the 
observation that a significant number of such term 
requests can be expressed using a limited number of 
pre-defined design patterns. In order to engage 
domain experts without extensive expertise in 
ontology development, we formulate the required 
input for each such design pattern as a Quick Term 
Template (QTT), which can be edited in an Excel 
spreadsheet. In the following, we illustrate an 
example of a common term request, namely assays 
that measure the concentration of a specified 
molecular compound in a given material. Requests 
for terms to identify such assays come from diverse 
communities, 
including 
EBI’s 
BioInvestigation 
index8, the Immune Epitope Database9 and Influenza 
Virus BioHealthbase10. This example illustrates the 
QTT process as a proof of principle. We claim that 
the approach can be easily extended to different 
design patterns. 
Methodology and Results 
The Quick Term Template submission process has 
four main steps: (1) Agreement by the OBI 
consortium on the logical definition of the parent 
class for submissions that match a certain pattern; (2) 
Identification of entities that can be varied with 
respect to the parent class (the differentia), for which 
a QTT spreadsheet is generated. This spreadsheet 
151

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
contains one column for each such entity; (3) 
Processing the QTT submission through the use of a 
script that translates each row of a QTT template into 
a logically definition of a class; (4) Agreement by the 
OBI Consortium on how these classes will be 
integrated into OBI (e.g., are they managed as a 
separate, imported, OWL file, or are they integrated 
into the core OBI itself). We elaborate on these steps 
below. 
Step 1: Develop the Representation of the Parent 
Class 
The example used throughout this section is a QTT 
for assays that measure the concentration of a 
specified molecular entity relative to a given material 
entity. These are called ‘analyte assays’ in OBI. Each 
definition 
links 
the 
material 
in 
which 
the 
concentration is measured (the evaluant), the 
molecular entity that is detected (the analyte), and the 
measurement 
being 
made 
(a 
scalar 
with 
a 
concentration value and unit). 
Textual definition: An analyte assay is an assay with 
the objective to determine concentration of one 
substance (bearer of analyte role) that is present in 
(part of) another (bearer of the evaluant role). The 
output of the assay is information about concentration 
– a relational quality of the analyte towards the 
evaluant. 
Logical definition: 
‘achieves planned objective’ some ‘analyte measurement 
objective’ 
and realizes some ('evaluant role' that ‘inheres in’ some 
‘material entity’) 
and realizes some ('analyte role' that ‘inheres in’ some 
'scattered molecular aggregate') 
and 
has_specified_output_information 
some 
('scalar 
measurement datum' and ('is quality measurement of' some 
'molecular concentration') and ('has measurement unit 
label' some concentration unit label')) 
Figure 1: RO based restrictions of OBI Analyte Assay 
Step 2: Derive Tabular Quick Term Template 
We found that a large number of our current requests 
for terms are subclasses of analyte assay. Their 
differentiae are what the analyte is (i.e., what the 
concentration is being detected of), and what the 
evaluant is (i.e., what material the concentration is 
detected in). Accordingly, a Quick Term Template for 
an analyte assay needs columns for only those two 
entities. Table 1 depicts a QTT with several example 
terms, as they would be seen in a spreadsheet.

OBI:1000023 
Glucose CHEBI:17234

left blank> 
Table 1: A basic QTT for submitting an analyte assay term request. 
The template hides the complexity of modeling by 
only identifying the differentiating entities needed for 
the definition of the class while hiding the actual 
relations binding those entities together. The burden 
of building the logical definition is hidden from the 
user, and is instead accomplished during processing 
of the template. A template such as this one is 
accompanied by guidelines for users explaining what 
values are allowed the columns, and how they will be 
interpreted in building the assay. Documentation, and 
possibly software, will restrict the source ontologies 
from which terms may be selected for column, and 
may further restrict to use of certain subclasses in the 
specified ontologies. 
Step 3: Submission processing  
Following submission of a completed QTT, Perl 
scripts generate the logical definition of the class, 
expressed in OWL, as follows: 
1.  Parse the incoming tab delimited file for syntactic 
accuracy. 
2. Identify each class to be included from an external 
ontology. As we are using OWL, all external 
resources need to be imported. In most cases, we 
rely on the MIREOT mechanism11 to do so. In  
short, OBI relies on an external.owl file 
containing references to external ontology terms 
that retain their ID space. This file is then read to 
determine whether additions are required and if so 
they are added. 
3. Create new OWL classes by populating the owl 
template with relevant values. As in the normal 
development of OBI, class identifiers are made 
unique to ensure that no conflicts arise when 
incorporating the newly generated class into OBI. 
4. Add metadata. As a QTT submission creates fully 
logically defined terms, the creation of labels and 
textual definitions can be automated as well. 
For the examples in Table 1, the class defined by 
152

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Row 1 is assigned the label ‘glucose concentration 
measurement in urine’, the class corresponding to 
Row 2 the label ‘interferon gamma concentration 
measurement in cell culture supernatant’, and the 
class corresponding to Row 3 the label ‘glucose 
concentration measurement’. Note that Row 3 in the 
table automatically gets classified as a superclass of 
Row 2. The empty cell is interpreted as any evaluant, 
and 
therefore 
every 
glucose 
concentration 
measurement in urine (Row 2) is_a glucose 
concentration measurement (Row 3). 
Step 4: Integration within OBI  
Check consistency. A consistency check and 
classification is carried out to verify integration and 
the integrity of the newly augmented OBI ontology. 
Conclusion and Future Work 
The QTT process outlined here provides a 
straightforward way to incorporate a large amount of 
key information submitted by domain experts in the 
communities OBI is designed to serve. Included in 
such are existing artifacts, such the IUPAC clinical 
chemistry resources12 that contain hundreds of 
assays. The procedure has the potential to address the 
pressing need expressed by many communities 
wanting to submit a large number of terms for 
inclusion in OBI.  
For future work, we plan to make the fully automated 
QTT submission process available for web-based 
submissions, with automated generation of OBI class 
identifiers. We would further like to explore the 
integration of OLS13 or BioPortal14 into the QTT 
process to streamline the process of finding existing 
terms, for instance by taking advantage of a full text 
search across appropriate external ontologies. Finally, 
the creation of a Protégé plug-in based on the QTT 
methodology would be a welcome addition to the 
functionality of the editor. OBI developers are keen 
to collaborate with other groups on this project in the 
hope others might benefit from this strategy for 
reducing 
bottlenecks 
associated 
with 
limited 
availability of knowledge engineers.

The Cell Cycle Ontology: 
An Application Ontology Supporting the Study of Cell Cycle Control

Abstract 
The Cell Cycle Ontology (CCO) is an application 
ontology that automatically captures and integrates 
detailed knowledge on the cell cycle process by 
combining, interlinking and enriching knowledge 
from various sources. CCO uses Semantic Web 
technologies, and it is accessible via the web for 
browsing, visualising, advanced querying, and 
computational reasoning. CCO facilitates a detailed 
analysis of cell cycle related molecular network 
components. Through querying and automated 
reasoning, it may provide new hypotheses to help 
steer a systems biology approach to biological 
network building. The ontology is available on 
http://www.cellcycleontology.org. Visual exploration 
can be done via the BioPortal, the Ontology Lookup 
Service, the Ontology Online service, or the 
DIAMONDS platform. 
The Cell Cycle Ontology 
The 
Cell 
Cycle 
Ontology 
captures 
detailed 
information (in terms and relationships) of the cell 
cycle process by combining representations from 
several, public sources.1 CCO supports four model 
organisms (H. sapiens, A. thaliana, S. pombe and S. 
cerevisiae) with separate ontologies and one 
integrated ontology. It is an application ontology that 
is supplied as an integrated turnkey system for 
exploratory 
analysis, 
advanced 
querying, 
and 
automated reasoning. 
CCO holds more than 13,000 concepts and 30 types 
of relationships. CCO comprises data from existing 
resources such as the Gene Ontology (GO), the 
Relations Ontology (RO), the IntAct database (MI), 
the NCBI taxonomy, the UniProt Knowledge Base as 
well as orthology data. An automatic pipeline builds 
CCO from scratch periodically: initially some 
existing ontologies (GO, RO, MI, in-house ones) are 
automatically 
fetched, 
integrated 
and 
merged, 
producing a core cell cycle ontology. Then, 
organism-specific protein and gene data are added 
from UniProt and from the GO Annotation files, 
generating four organism-specific ontologies. Those 
four ontologies are merged and more terms are 
included from an ontology built automatically from 
the OrthoMCL execution on the cell cycle proteins. 
Formats and Queries 
CCO is built in the OBOF format with ONTO-PERL 
and exported to other formats later.2 CCO is available 
in: OBOF, RDF, XML, OWL, GML, and DOT. The 
Semantic Web formats RDF and OWL allow queries 
on CCO. In a SPARQL endpoint complex queries on 
the RDF format can be formulated, such as “retrieve 
all the core cell cycle proteins in S. cerevisiae that are 
located in the cytoplasm and that have a 
hydrolysisrelated function”. 
Relational closures are pre-inferenced in the RDF 
triple store, by operating SPARUL update queries 
over CCO and Metarel. This allows for very simple 
and responsive queries over long chains of relations 
in CCO. 
Finally, during the maintenance phase, a semantic 
improvement on the OWL version is carried out: 
Ontology Design Patterns are included using the 
Ontology Pre-Processor Language. The resulting 
CCO is designed to provide a richer view of the cell 
cycle 
regulatory 
process, 
in 
particular 
by 
accommodating the intrinsic dynamics of this 
process.

Applying Biomedical Ontologies on Semantic Query Expansion 
Andre Bechara, Maria Luiza M. Campos, Vanessa Braganholo 
Informatics Graduate Program (PPGI), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 
Abstract 
This poster presents an ongoing work on using 
biomedical ontologies to improve efficiency on 
information retrieval.  
Introduction 
The interpretation of a question (or information need) 
depends, among other things, of a series of lexical-
semantic relations that complement and help the 
cognitive process of answering that information need. 
Despite this fact, currently used information retrieval 
mechanisms take few advantages of the semantic 
interpretation of users’ information needs (usually 
specified through keywords). In most of the cases, 
those mechanisms are based on keyword matching, 
and thus are excessively dependant on the query and 
document terms.  
There are several past results1,2 showing that, in 
general, information retrieval based on domain 
knowledge decreases the accuracy of keyword based 
search engines. We believe this approach deserves 
further discussion and experimentation, looking for 
more strong evidences that these negative results can 
really be generalized. Moreover, there are some 
questions left unanswered by previous work that our 
experiment is addressing: 
(i) Using a scientific ontology, with formal 
construction and maintenance processes, such as the 
OBO ontologies, would produce better results? (ii) 
Are there more efficient query expansion techniques 
using available domain knowledge? (iii) Is a 
scientific ontology complete enough to fulfill the 
information retrieval researchers’ needs, in general? 
Semantic Query Expansion 
To try to answer some of these questions, we run a 
query expansion experiment using the Gene 
Ontology (GO) as domain knowledge. As the 
document repository, we used an extraction of 10 
years of Pub Med publications (from 1994 to 2004), 
which contains approximately 4.6 millions of 
documents. This dataset is a test-collection used by 
the information retrieval community, called Genomic 
TREC. 
Results 
To evaluate our ontology-based semantic query 
expansion technique, we measured the effectiveness 
of the information retrieval mechanism with and 
without expansion. In a nutshell, the average result 
showed an increase of 28% on synonyms relations 
and a small decrease on other relations.  
Our results show a lot of consistence with past 
related work. In fact, if the expansion strategy does 
not selectively choose when and how to expand, only 
synonym relations are worth to be used. However, 
looking further, it is possible to find several 
opportunities to try other expansion strategies. For 
example, the problem with query expansion using 
generalization/specialization relationships is that, if it 
is always applied, the bad results are more frequent 
than the good ones. But, if the strategy is to be 
selective on when to use these relations for 
expansion, the increasing on accuracy can be 
outstanding. As shown by our experiment, there was 
a query with 98% increment on effectiveness. 
Conclusion 
We strongly believe that it is premature to assume 
that semantics-based query expansion is, in general, a 
recall-enhancing, precision-degrading technique. Our 
experiments suggest that by using scientific based 
ontologies (like OBO ontologies) with formal 
relations, it is possible to increase both recall and 
precision. Our group is currently revising this first 
experiment 
towards 
a 
better 
semantic 
query 
expansion strategy.

Developing a Mammalian Behaviour Ontology 
Tim Beck, John M. Hancock, Ann-Marie Mallon 
MRC Harwell, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Oxfordshire, UK 
Abstract 
The use of the Entity + Quality (EQ) model in 
phenotypic descriptions is dependent on the use of 
specialised domain ontologies to define the entity 
under observation. A domain currently lacking a 
specialised ontology is mammalian behaviour and so 
the Mammalian Behaviour Ontology is being 
constructed to address this. The ontology is manually 
developed and encourages contributions from 
domain experts. A top-level class distinction is made 
between individual behaviours and behaviours 
between two or more individuals. 
Introduction 
The EUMODIC project (http://www.eumodic.org) is 
generating a large volume of data from the high-
throughput phenotyping of approximately 500 mutant 
mouse 
lines. 
EuroPhenome 
(http://www.europhenome.org) 
is 
the 
open-access 
database resource developed to contain this wealth of 
data. The phenotype data is defined using Open 
Biomedical 
Ontoloiges 
(OBO) 
derived 
post-
composed terms, which combine Entities (E) and 
Qualities (Q)1. The qualities are consistently defined 
using the PATO ontology2, however the entities are 
defined in alternative domain-specific ontologies 
depending 
on 
the 
class 
of 
the 
observation 
(anatomical, biochemical, behavioural etc). In the 
domain of animal behaviour, there currently exists a 
small subset of terms in existing OBO ontologies and 
the broad-scope Animal Behaviour Ontology3, 
however a specialised ontology for the description of 
mouse behaviours is lacking. 
A specialised ontology for the description of 
mammalian behaviours is a pre-requisite for the 
comprehensive annotation of phenotypes within 
EuroPhenome; and so work has begun on developing 
the Mammalian Behaviour Ontology (MBO). 
Results 
The MBO draws a fundamental distinction between 
adult behaviours in isolation from other individuals 
and behaviours between individuals, which are 
broadly analogous to the Gene Ontology biological 
process concepts “adult behaviour” (GO:0030534) 
and “behavioral interaction between organisms” 
(GO:0051705). This distinction forms the two top-
level classes of the ontology (Figure 1). Subsequent 
child classes have been manually added and define 
behaviours observed during EUMODIC phenotype 
screens; those contained within the literature; and 
those defined as abnormal behavioural phenotypes 
within the Mammalian Phenotype ontology. 
Figure 1. Top level classes of the Mammalian Behaviour Ontology 
Conclusion 
The MBO will be further developed in collaboration 
with mouse behavioural experts and will allow for 
precise definition of behaviour phenotypes using the 
EQ paradigm. The MBO will be used in conjunction 
with assay ontologies to define the environmental 
conditions experienced by the organism when 
exhibiting a specific behaviour, for example relating 
a compulsive biting behaviour to handling during the 
SHIRPA protocol.

SNePS as an Ontological Reasoning Tool 
Jonathan P. Bona, Stuart C. Shapiro 
University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA 
Abstract 
SNePS is a logic-based Knowledge Representation, 
Reasoning, and Acting system. We have created 
extensions to SNePS that allow its use as an ontology 
reasoning system, combining (1) instance data stored 
in a Referent Tracking1 system, (2) facts from domain 
ontologies such as FMA, and (3) rules from a 
domain-independent ontological theory. This paper 
discusses the first of these. 
Introduction 
SNePS is a Knowledge Representation, Reasoning, 
and Acting system that combines elements of 
network-based, 
frame-based, 
and 
logic-based 
systems, with models of inference appropriate to each 
paradigm.2 SNePSLOG, the logical language of 
SNePS is higher-order, allowing variables to range 
over predicates and function symbols, and term-
based, allowing proposition-valued terms to be 
arguments of other functional terms. The software 
interface that is the subject of this paper connects 
SNePS to a prototype implementation of a referent 
tracking system (henceforth “The RTS”).3 
Electronic health systems in the Referent Tracking 
paradigm improve on previous systems by making 
unique, explicit, reference to individual particular 
entities in the world, universals, and the relationships 
that hold between and among these.1 Each particular 
entity to which the system refers has assigned to it a 
globally unique identifier, which is used to refer to 
the entity in assertions about it that are stored in the 
system. Such assertions may also refer to universals 
and relations defined in external ontologies such as 
the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), and to 
concept codes from SNOMED CT and others. 
SNePS/RTS Interface 
We have implemented an interface that allows SNePS 
to import data from an online RTS system in real 
time as it is needed in the course of reasoning, or as 
the result of a query, and perform inference on that 
data.  
Entries stored in the RTS can be viewed as tuples, 
each representing an assertion by an agent that a state 
of affairs was observed at one time to obtain at some 
time. There are tuples to represent that a particular 
instantiates a universal, that a particular stands in 
some relation to other particulars, and more.  
For example, the Particular-to-Universal tuple: 
<id1,2004.03.23 21:37:53, instance of, OBO REL, 
id2, Face, FMA, 2004.03.23 21:37:53 > says that the 
entity with id id1 asserted on 23 March 2004 at 
21:37:53 that the entity with id id2 instantiates, via 
the OBO REL relation instance of, the FMA universal 
Face on 23 March 2004 at 21:37:53. 
These assertions are represented in SNePS as 
Asserted(p,t,asn), meaning that p asserted at time t 
that asn. Each assertion, asn, is represented by a 
proposition-valued functional term. For example, 
Inst(p,u,r,t) means that entity p instantiates universal 
u via relation r at time t. 
The information in the PtoU tuple above is 
represented in SNePSLOG as the formula: 
Asserted (id1, 
  time (2004,03,23,21,37,53),  
  Inst(id2, universal (Face, FMA),  
  relation(OBO_REL, instance_of),  
  time(2004,03,23,21,37,53))) 
Conclusion 
This interface allows SNePS to access instance data 
in the RTS as needed in the course of answering a 
query or performing other reasoning tasks. It 
provides a simple way of querying the RTS system 
from SNePS. This interface may also be used in 
combination with SNePS’ native reasoning and 
acting capabilities to perform advanced reasoning 
tasks with patient data in a referent tracking system. 
In a similar manner, SNePS can import data from 
other sources (ontologies, concept systems, etc.), and 
combine them with data from the RTS.

Organizing Search Results by Ontological Relations 
Miao Chen 
Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA 
Abstract 
The study aims to propose a framework to organize 
retrieved results based on relations between query 
concepts. For user query containing more than one 
concept, we can identify semantic relations between 
the concepts with the help of domain ontology as well 
as natural language processing (NLP) and machine 
learning techniques. And then the relations will serve 
as the criteria of organizing and categorizing search 
results.  
Introduction 
In modern information retrieval systems, retrieved 
documents are primarily organized in two ways: 
relevance ranking and similarity (or distance) based 
clustering (Pratt, et al., 1999). There have also been 
trials in representing documents by knowledge-based 
approaches, i.e. organizing documents by concepts and 
hierarchical structure of ontologies (Pratt, et al. 1999; 
Chen and Dumais, 2000). However, non-hierarchical 
relations are seldom taken into consideration in this 
part of retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, there 
has been no study on organizing retrieved documents 
based on ontological relations (both hierarchical and 
non-hierarchical) between query concepts. Ontology 
provides comprehensive domain knowledge, including 
relations between concepts. Therefore ontological 
relations might help with organizing search results to 
facilitate user information seeking. 
Research Design 
The research design includes four primary steps to 
guide implementation. For experiment, we will use 
the UMLS ontology and Google search results. 
1) Match query terms to ontology concepts and find 
their relations. For example, query “liver cancer, 
food” contains two concepts from the UMLS 
ontology. And the relations between their semantic 
types are “food causes liver cancer” or “food affects 
liver cancer”; 
2) In search result collection, we identify candidate 
sentences that have both concepts of the query and at 
least one candidate relation concept; 
3) Syntactic level NLP algorithm will be used to 
parse each candidate sentence in the retrieved 
documents; 
4) Classify 
candidate 
sentences 
into 
relation 
categories (determined by query term relations from 
ontology). Retrieved documents with the same 
relations between concepts are organized together. 
Following the example in step1, search results are 
categorized into two sets, the “cause” set and the 
“affect” set, based on the possible relations between 
liver cancer and food (as shown in Figure 1). Under 
the two categories, results can be further divided into 
sub-categories according to the UMLS relation 
structure. For example, the “treat” set is arranged 
under the “affect” set, the same way as in the 
ontological relation structure. 
Figure 1. Search results organized by query relations 
Evaluation 
We will evaluate the new search result organization 
approach by comparing user satisfaction of two 
cases: 1) search results organized in relevance 
ranking, which is a result list from Google result; 2) 
retrieved results organized based on relations, which 
is the reorganization work of our study based on 
Google results. Content analysis will be conducted on 
the interview data to understand the strengths and 
weaknesses of relation-based organization from user 
perspective.

NEUROWEB: 
A Case-Study of Clinical Phenotype Ontology in the Neurovascular Domain 
Gianluca Colombo1, Daniele Merico2

Abstract 
We present the challenges encountered in the 
NEUROWEB project, as a case study of ontology for 
clinical phenotypes. The project aimed at developing 
an IT-support system for association studies. We 
identified the clinical phenotypes as the main entity 
of the ontological model, and we developed a model 
for their representation. 
The Clinical Phenotypes Model 
The NEUROWEB Project supports association 
studies in the neurovascular domain, integrating 
patient data from different clinical sites. Association 
studies typically require sets of patients with similar 
clinical conditions, i.e. with a common clinical 
phenotype. 
Therefore, 
we 
identified 
the 
representation of clinical phenotypes as the major 
modeling commitment. We selected a specific 
disorder, Ischemic Stroke, as a case-study. Ischemic 
Stroke is an occlusive disorder leading to local brain 
damage. 
Neurovascular 
pathologies 
are 
typically 
organized taxonomically within clinical guidelines 
(such as the TOAST 1 for Ischemic Stroke) accepted 
by different clinical communities. For this reason, we 
initially devised a two-layer ontological model. The 
top layer (Top Phenotypes) was composed by the 
Ischemic Stroke taxonomy according to the TOAST. 
The lower layer, the Core Data Set (CDS), was 
constituted by clinical indicators (a) essential for 
neurovascular diagnosis, and (b) connected to a 
specific field in the local clinical databases. Top 
Phenotypes were deconstructed into CDS elements 
using logical formulas reminiscent of SQL queries. 
This model was sufficient to select a pre-defined 
clinical phenotype and retrieve the corresponding 
patients from the databases. 
To enhance the functionalities supported by the 
ontological model (flexible/modular definition of 
clinical 
phenotypes, 
integration 
to 
external 
terminologies, integration with genomic resources), 
the model was extended adding a middle layer, 
termed Low Phenotypes. We followed the following 
principles: A) set a distinction between physiological 
events/processes and their diagnostic evidences; the 
former entities were essential to establish connections 
set a distinction between the etiological background 
and the traumatic point-event characterizing a 
neurovascular disorder; this choice was suggested, in 
the specific case of Ischemic Stroke, by the partition 
between clinical findings (i) pertaining to the 
occlusion event and its downstream effects, and (ii) 
the underlying disease (e.g. atherosclerosis, diabetes) 
leading to the generation of the occluding body; C) 
set a distinction between (clinical) phenotypes and 
anatomical parts or topological concepts; the latter 
entities are not phenotypes, but they are used for the 
phenotype formulation. 
Figure 1. NEUROWEB ontology metamodel. 
As a result, a Top Phenotype is decomposed into a 
Durative Etiological Background and a Traumatic 
Point-Event through the Has-Cause-Durative and 
Has-Cause-PointEvent relations respectively. These 
entities are connected to their diagnostic evidences 
via the Has-Diagnostic-Evidence relation, and to the 
Biomolecular Processes via the Involves relation. The 
By-Means-Of relation connects the Diagnostic 
Evidences to the CDS Indicator and its value range 
(Diagnostic Value) required for their assessment.  
The NEUROWEB Reference Ontology was 
implemented in OWL-DL.

Logical Identity of Digital Files 
Primavera De Filippi 
European University Institute, Florence, Italy 
Abstract 
A proper analysis of copyright law necessarily 
requires accurate identifications of the various 
subject matters involved. The law provides a series of 
indications with regard to what constitutes a work of 
authorship for the purpose of the copyright regime, 
yet a fundamental question persists: What is it that 
really constitutes a work? Providing a definition of 
the term is not as intuitive as it may seem, especially 
not in the digital environment. As a general rule, the 
concept of a work is to be distinguished from the 
expression it has been articulated into and the 
manifestation be discerned from the item into which 
it has been embodied. In the digital world, however, 
the notion of an item may need to be somewhat 
adjusted so as to be more compatible with the common 
understanding of what constitutes a digital file. 
Introduction 
According to the Functional Requirement for 
Bibliographic Records (FRBR) of the IFLA,1 any 
work of authorship can be subdivided into four basic 
components: 
the 
work, 
the 
expression, 
the 
manifestation and the item. Copyright protection, 
however, does not apply uniformly to every 
component of the work. In particular, the use of an 
item is not regulated by copyright law insofar as it 
does not infringe the copyright vesting in the work, 
the expression, or the manifestation thereof. In 
addition, the doctrine of exhaustion allows for any 
legitimately obtained item to be freely redistributed 
without the consent of the copyright owner. In the 
digital environment, however, the legitimate transfer 
of digital files may become impossible, as the 
transfer of a digital work would necessarily produce 
a new item of the work, which is physically different 
and yet logically identical to the former. It becomes, 
therefore, crucial to determine what constitutes a 
digital file and to identify when two digital files can 
actually be regarded as being identical. 
Identification of Digital Items 
An item is generally defined as a tangible carrier of 
information. It emerges from the fixation of a 
particular manifestation into a physical object and 
may only exist as a single instance (e.g. the copy of a 
book purchased by an individual, the specific digital 
file downloaded by a particular user, etc). 
What appears to be a straightforward concept in the 
physical world has proven to be a controversial topic 
in the digital environment.  
A digital item is a piece of content that is expressed 
in a digital format and subsists as a tangible entity on 
the physical memory of computers or other electronic 
devices. The transfer of a digital item, however, 
necessarily involves reproduction. Transfer can only 
be achieved by generating a copy in a new location 
and subsequently destroying the original. These two 
items are likely to assume a completely different 
physical 
representation 
while 
nonetheless 
maintaining their distinctive properties as digital 
items. Although they are physically distinct, from a 
structural 
perspective 
they 
are 
fundamentally 
identical and may therefore be recognized as one 
single entity. Accordingly, even if two digital entities 
will never be the same in an absolute sense, there are 
indeed 
circumstances 
where 
they 
should 
be 
considered, 
nevertheless, 
identical 
for 
some 
determined purpose.2 
Conclusion 
For the purpose of copyright law, therefore, an item 
may refer to any tangible entity which represents a 
unique exemplary of a particular manifestation of a 
work, taking into account that so long as the item can 
be identified as being the same,  it is not necessary 
for the tangible entities to remain the same. An item 
can however only be properly identified when taking 
into account the context into which it is to be 
identified. Although the traditional FRBR framework 
may seem inadequate for the digital environment, an 
additional layer could be implemented to introduce 
the notion of “digital file” as a fictional container 
employed to determine logical equivalence between 
digital documents. In this way, the remaining 
conflicts existing between the definition of physical 
and digital items could be resolved.

Abstract 
We, participants in the Translational Medicine 
Ontology 
activity 
of 
the 
World 
Wide 
Web 
Consortium’s Health Care and Life Sciences Interest 
Group 
(http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLSIG) 
and 
members of the National Center for Biomedical 
Ontology (http://bioontology.org/), are developing a 
high-level, patient-centric ontology for translational 
medicine which will draw on existing domain 
ontologies and allow the integration of data 
throughout the drug development process. 
Introduction 
The pharmaceutical industry has historically focused 
on the development of novel blockbuster drugs. 
There is now an increasing focus on personalized 
medicines, requiring the right patients to receive the 
right drug at the right dose. In order to develop a 
tailored drug, manufacturers need to identify 
biomarkers that will indicate how a given patient will 
respond to a particular treatment. Biomarkers can 
also be used to demonstrate the comparative 
effectiveness of drugs, which is increasingly required 
by payers. Such translational medicine strategies 
require that traditionally separate data sets from early 
drug discovery through to patients in the clinical 
setting be integrated, and presented, queried and 
analyzed collectively. Ontologies can be used to 
drive such data integration and analysis; however, at 
present few ontologies exist that bridge genomics, 
chemistry and the medical domain. 
The Translational Medicine Ontology, an application 
ontology 
that 
bridges 
the 
diverse 
areas 
of 
translational medicine, draws on existing domain 
ontologies where appropriate and will provide a 
framework centered on less than 50 types of entities. 
Goals 
The Translational Medicine Ontology will facilitate 
data integration from diverse areas of translational 
medicine such as discovery research, hypothesis 
management, formulation, clinical trials, and clinical 
research. It will serve as a template for further 
ontology development, enabling scientists to answer 
interesting and currently difficult questions more 
easily, especially those about data that are typically 
hosted by different functional areas. The ontology 
will provide a framework for the modeling of patient-
centric information, which is essential for tailoring 
drugs. 
Methodology 
We have identified a set of 17 roles played by people 
across health care and the life sciences and collected 
(1) relevant questions, (2) the entities that those 
questions involve, and (3) applicable extant domain 
ontologies.1 Types of entities include: disease, drug, 
patient, target, gene, risk, pathway, population, 
compound, phenotype, and treatment. 
Next steps will involve identifying use cases based 
on those questions, determining which entities to 
build into the ontology and aligning them with BFO,2 
an upper-level ontology, to aid interoperability 
between domain ontologies. We will use one use case 
to test the Translational Medicine Ontology by 
building a data integration application based on it. 
Conclusion 
This project seeks to develop a patient-centric 
application ontology for translational medicine, as a 
collaborative effort between groups in industry and 
academia. The presentation will highlight our 
methodology, work to date, and future steps.

Accurate Biochemical Knowledge Representation 
with Precise, Structure-Based Identifiers 
Michel Dumontier, Leonid L. Chepelev 
Department of Biology, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada 
Abstract 
Biochemical ontologies aim to represent biochemical 
entities and the relations that exist between them in 
an accurate and precise manner. A fundamental 
starting point is the use of identifiers that precisely 
and uniquely identify some biochemical entity. Yet, 
our current approach for generating identifiers is 
often haphazard and incomplete. We describe 
plausible structure-based strategies for biochemical 
identity, ultimately to generate identifiers in an 
automatic and curator/database independent fashion, 
whether it is at molecular level or some part thereof.  
Introduction 
Accurate biochemical knowledge representation is 
embodied through the capacity to describe cellular 
events at all levels of biochemical granularity 
(organelle, membrane, substance, complex, molecule, 
molecular region, residue and atom) with their 
intended 
meaning 
wholly 
and 
unambiguously 
preserved. Fundamental to accurate knowledge 
representation is the ability to refer to real world 
entities in a precise manner, that is to say, that the 
identifiers for the entities to be described are readily 
available and that they consistently refer to the 
described entity. Having precise identifiers provides 
the basis by which access to independently generated 
knowledge becomes possible, at least initially by 
linked data1. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
biochemical identifiers are generated in a haphazard 
manner. For instance, a protein identifier may be 
generated based on the biological source, the 
biopolymer sequence, the encoding gene and/or the 
mRNA transcript from which it was translated. This 
means that structurally identical entities occurring in 
different contexts actually have different identifiers. 
The practice would be akin to giving you an 
arbitrarily generated name for each place you have 
been and each activity you have participated in, while 
maintaining that each of “you” is a different person. 
At the same time, biochemical entity modifications 
that have a radical impact on the structure and 
function are omitted or simply catalogued as 
annotations of possible structural variations for a 
given biochemical entity. 
Results 
With a clear need for precise biochemical identifiers, 
we 
describe 
three 
possible 
approaches 
for 
consideration by the community. The first simply 
involves the specification of existing chemical 
identifiers, the second employs a hybrid string-
structure format, while the final approach takes 
advantage of the increased expressivity of the most 
recent Web Ontology Language (OWL2) to specify 
structural certainty including negative results as well 
as 
structural 
uncertainty 
from 
ambiguous 
or 
indeterminate experiments. Mechanisms for unique 
identification of parts and collections of parts are 
presented. These unique identifiers can be converted 
to an explicit representation in a variety of languages 
including OWL. Thus, not only can these identifiers 
be generated independently and have a consistently 
meaning, but they can also in themselves provides all 
the information about what they describe.  
Conclusion 
In order to efficiently communicate the results of 
biochemical experiments and to further integrate 
experimental information into semantic frameworks, 
the biochemical community needs a standard for 
unambiguous 
and 
accurate 
identification 
of 
biochemical entities. Just like the widespread 
implementation 
of 
SMILES 
and 
InChI 
representations has tremendously accelerated the 
pace of chemical research, we believe that the 
acceptance 
of 
a 
standardized, 
accurate, 
and 
descriptive biochemical identifier scheme within 
biochemical literature will be inexpensive while 
opening up countless new opportunities for data 
integration, reasoning over biochemical knowledge, 
and streamlined biological research.

An Ontology for RNA Structure and Interaction

Abstract 
Increasingly sophisticated knowledge about RNA 
structure and function requires ontologies to 
facilitate the integration of information arising from 
genome sequencing projects, microarray analyses 
and structure determination experiments. Here, we 
describe an ontology for nucleic acid composition 
along with context/model-specific representation of 
structural features such as sugar conformations, 
base pairings and base stackings. The ontology 
supports the goals of the RNA Ontology Consortium 
towards 
discovery 
of 
new 
knowledge 
from 
independently-published RNA data. 
Introduction 
The ability to accurately capture biomolecular 
behavior is critical to our understanding of cellular 
systems. Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) are essential 
cellular components with significant roles in protein 
synthesis 
and 
gene 
regulation. 
Increasingly 
sophisticated knowledge about RNA structure and 
function is being revealed as a result of innovative 
biochemical 
investigations 
such 
as 
genome 
sequencing 
projects, 
sequence 
alignments, 
microarray analyses, structure determination and 
RNA SELEX experiments. Yet, our capacity to 
capture this knowledge by existing representations is 
limited in at least one important respect. First, 
RNAML1, an XML-based exchange format for a 
select subset of information, is not arbitrarily 
extensible by users. For instance, the nature of base 
stacking can be described with a natural language 
comment as part of the base-stack element, but we 
cannot specify a machine understandable type (e.g. 
adjacent stacking or upward stacking). 
The use of formal logic-based languages such as 
RDF/OWL to describe knowledge about RNA 
structure and interactions provides the means for any 
researcher to further extend structural and functional 
annotations of experiments and biological objects in 
both a machine accessible and de-centralized manner. 
Results 
Here, we describe an RNA ontology for structure-
oriented knowledge using RDF/OWL, Semantic Web 
technologies, that overcomes the limitations of XML-
based approaches such as RNAML. The ontology 
provides knowledge for nucleic acid composition 
along with context/model-specific representation of 
structural features such as sugar conformations, base 
pairings and base stackings.  
We 
populated 
the 
ontology 
with 
structural 
descriptions from the Protein Data Bank along with 
base pairing, base stacking interactions reported from 
MC-Annotate. The resulting RNA knowledge base 
enables powerful question answering over a 
reasoning-capable OWL-DL system.  
Conclusion 
This work provides the basis by which other essential 
RNA structural and functional features may be 
added. Furthermore, the ontology also enables the 
accurate representation of highly dynamic and 
context specific RNA structure interactions. Finally, 
it supports the aim of the RNA Ontology 
Consortium2 “to create an integrated conceptual 
framework, an RNA Ontology (RO), with a common, 
dynamic, controlled, and structured vocabulary to 
describe and characterize RNA sequences, secondary 
structures, 
three 
dimensional 
structures, 
and 
dynamics pertaining to RNA function”.

Phenotypic data are routinely used to elucidate gene

However, 
although 
phenotype ontologies exist for many eukaryotic 
model organisms, no standardized system exists for 
the capture of phenotypic information in bacteria. We 
propose to build an Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes 
and use it to annotate the prokaryotic model 
organism Escherichia coli. 
Introduction  
Phenotypes are the observable characteristics of an 
organism that result from the combination of a 
particular genotype and a particular environment, and 
thus are a basic and fundamental aspect of the 
biology of all organisms. The awesome power of 
genetics is founded on how the phenotypes of mutant 
genes, alone and in combination, contribute to 
understanding the biology of affected systems. To 
fully exploit the power of phenotypes for functional 
and comparative genomics, the ability to make 
comparisons across datasets and systems is vital. 
Making these comparisons either manually or 
computationally is hindered by the fact that 
phenotypes are not described consistently for 
bacteria. Our project aims to develop annotation 
infrastructure 
to 
improve 
the 
ability 
of 
microbiologists and bioinformaticians to use both 
existing and new phenotype information and to 
capture it in a consistent and standardized manner. 
This will require two key components: 1) an 
Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes (OMP) that 
captures phenotype descriptions in a controlled 
vocabulary, and 2) a set of evidence codes based on 
extension of the existing Evidence Code Ontology,1 
with links to a database of papers and other resources 
describing the assays used to “measure” these 
phenotypes. 
Results 
We have explored two parallel approaches to building 
the OMP. Both are pre-coordinated approaches that 
rely on using the terms in the Phenotypic Quality 
Ontology (PATO) as a basis for building up 
phenotype terms.2 In the first approach we read 100 
papers and identified 40 phenotypes described in 
those papers. We organized the 40 phenotypes into a 
controlled vocabulary using OBO-Edit.3 While this 
effort was not comprehensive, we were able to classify 
the 40 phenotypes into five superclasses and assign 
PATO entities and qualities. In the second approach 
we generated a cross-product between a selection of 
PATO terms and two GO nodes relevant to microbial 
phenotypes, “cellular carbohydrate metabolism” and 
“amino acid metabolism.” We found the cross-product 
generation method to be quite effective in generating 
large numbers of relevant terms quickly. 
Conclusion 
The 
manual 
and 
cross-product 
efforts 
were 
undertaken independently and in parallel by separate 
members of the group to see what, if any, consistency 
would be achieved. We found that although the 
concepts captured were similar, the different 
researchers chose different PATO quality terms to 
represent the same concepts. The manual curator 
chose “abnormal,” while the person working on 
cross-products chose “abolished” and “disrupted.” 
The results of this exercise illustrate one reason why 
the pre-coordinated approach has advantages over the 
post-coordinated approach. In the post-coordinated 
approach separate annotators creating phenotype 
annotations at different points in time may choose 
different ways of expressing the same concept and 
thus create inconsistency. In the pre-coordinated 
approach, one controlled set of PATO terms will be 
used for term generation, and the fact of storing all 
the terms in one controlled vocabulary will enforce 
consistency and uniformity.

Clonal Complexes in Biomedical Ontologies

Abstract 
An accurate classification of bacteria is essential for 
the proper identification of patient infections and 
subsequent 
treatment 
decisions. 
Multi-Locus 
Sequence Typing (MLST) is a genetic technique for 
bacterial classification. MLST classifications are 
used to cluster bacteria into clonal complexes. 
Importantly, clonal complexes can serve as a 
biological species concept for bacteria, facilitating 
an otherwise difficult taxonomic classification. In this 
paper, we argue for the inclusion of terms relating to 
clonal complexes in biomedical ontologies.   
Introduction 
Many of the difficulties in classifying bacteria stem 
from the fact that bacteria are both biological 
organisms (subject to biological classification) and, in 
certain circumstances, pathogens (subject to a disease-
based classification). The fact that a bacterium can 
play the role of pathogen is an important ontological 
fact, but entities should not be classified solely on the 
basis of the roles they can play. If there is to be a bias 
in classifying bacteria, it should be a biological bias. 
This provides a more uniform classification scheme 
for all biological organisms. 
Adopting such a classification brings up the 
problem of how to treat species at the microbiological 
scale. Following Mayr1, we adopt the biological 
species concept in which differing species are 
separated by a barrier to gene flow.  
Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and 
Biomedical Ontologies 
MLST is a popular method for achieving a biological 
classification for bacteria by using the allelic 
differences of seven housekeeping genes to determine 
the degree of relatedness between strains. “Clonal 
expansion [for bacteria] results from the rise in 
frequency of a single highly adaptive genotype. These 
ancestral genotypes subsequently diversify through 
recombination or mutation to produce minor clonal 
variants, and hence a 'complex' of closely related 
strains.2” The BURST clustering algorithm uses 
MLST data to infer this ancestral genotype and assign 
observed genotypes to clonal complexes. Seven 
genetic housekeeping loci are selected for a given 
genotype pool and the ancestral genotype is defined 
to be “the genotype within the clonal complex that 
differs from the highest number of other genotypes in 
the clonal complex at only one locus out of seven 
[these are called single locus variants (SLV)].2” The 
BURST algorithm succeeds when the assigned 
ancestral genotypes match the actual ancestral 
genotype in the phylogeny of the bacteria.  BURST 
output is usable as biological species demarcation 
when the complexes are genetically isolated as 
illustrated in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. BURST clustering into clonal complexes 
This technique does not always produce crisp 
demarcations between clonal complexes due to 
horizontal gene transfer. However, any biological 
taxonomy must tolerate some vagueness and fuzzy 
borders. 
The inclusion of clonal complexes in biomedical 
ontologies requires the inclusion of several other terms: 
clone, isolate, strain, housekeeping gene, ancestral 
genotype, recombination, and clonal divergence. The 
adoption of these terms will yield a more uniform 
treatment of biotic entities of all sizes and will furnish 
a sound biological basis for disease ontologies.

The Evolution Ontology 
Adam M. Goldstein 
Darwin Digital Library of Evolution, AMNH, New York, USA 
Abstract 
Existing ontologies model components of evolution, 
but none synthesize them or describe the framework 
of ideas used to conceptualize evolution. The 
Evolution Ontology (EO) aims to do just this. EO 
models processes (e.g. natural selection); contexts 
(e.g. habitats); the entities that undergo evolution; 
and the theories, methods, and disciplines of 
evolutionary science. Uses include data curation, 
data mining, and literature curation, EO’s developers 
working on the latter two for works of Darwin and 
the Biodiversity Heritage Library. 
Motivations 
That evolution provides an organizing framework for 
the life sciences and important disciplines and 
theories of the behavioral sciences is well-
understood. EO aims to model this organizing 
framework, for literature and data curation and data 
mining. EO's focus on evolutionary processes will 
provide life scientists with a capability they presently 
lack, even in incipient form. At present, no ontology 
exists—indeed, no scheme of organization whatever 
exists—for representing the evolutionary process. 
MeSH,1 is poor in terms describing evolution. There 
do exist models of entities at many levels in the 
hierarchy of biological organization and across taxa, 
including genes, phenotypes, homologies, and 
physiological processes.2,3 Nonetheless, these have 
yet to be described in a manner that displays their 
roles in the evolutionary process. 
EO aims to provide a way to organize 
information in a manner most useful for someone 
asking, of some variant gene or other “unit” of 
biological variation, Why (or how) did this (the 
actual) state of variation come to obtain? To answer 
questions like this, a researcher needs to know which 
evolutionary processes occurred in the history of the 
population under study; the “unit'” of variation that is 
evolving, and how it varies; and the causal 
background against which the changes have taken 
place (e.g. a habitat). As the user base of EO grows, 
researchers will be able to explore data and literature 
of evolution tailoring queries to reflect features of 
evolution most relevant to the population under study. 
Modeling the concepts of evolution with an 
ontology is preferable to doing so by means of a 
subject heading list. The reasons for this are the same 
in the case of EO as they are in the case of other 
domains modeled using ontologies: they describe the 
relationships among the entities modeled, promoting 
discovery, and machine intelligence can be used to 
discover properties of the domain that otherwise 
would remain undetected. 
Semantics 
EO models evolution on the following schema: “If 
(and only if) entity E evolves in a context X by a 
process P, there is some change in a statistical 
property of E, which measures the degree to which a 
character C is present in the population.” Processes P 
include natural selection, random drift, speciation, 
and the like. Context X is a generalization of the 
concept of habitat. An entity E is simply any  
population that can evolve; the character C is any 
heritable property of E whose distribution in E can 
change. EO also describes evolution in terms of 
disciplines, methods, and models and theories. 
Literature Curation and Text Mining with EO 
EO's developers will use it to organize the works of 
the Biodiversity Heritage Library.4 The BHL, having 
digitized 12,605,478 pages, aims to publish all works 
for which permission can be obtained in the print 
collections of a worldwide consortium of libraries of 
Natural History. The BHL’s search tool has 
rudimentary subject indexing tools, and because of 
this together with the BHL’s massive size, it is 
virtually useless for information resource discovery. 
EO is also being used to mine Darwin's Origin in 
order to detect trends and connections in his 
developing thought.

Uberon: Towards a Comprehensive Multi-Species Anatomy Ontology 
Melissa A. Haendel1, Georgios V. Gkoutos2, Suzanna E. Lewis3, Christopher J. Mungall3

3Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley CA, USA  
Abstract 
The lack of a single unified species-neutral ontology 
covering the anatomy of a variety of metazoans is a 
hindrance to translating model organism research to 
human health. We have developed an Uber-anatomy 
ontology to fill this need, filling the gap between the 
CARO upper-level ontology and species-specific 
anatomical ontologies. 
Introduction 
A number of anatomical ontologies (AOs) exist for 
specific organisms such as human, mouse and fish, 
many of which utilize the Common Anatomy 
Reference Ontology (CARO)1 to structure the 
highest-level nodes. However, there is as yet a lack 
of a unified species-neutral ontology containing 
representations of embryonic and mature anatomical 
entities that conforms to OBO Foundry principles, 
similar to the Gene Ontology (GO) for gene function. 
Other cross species terminologies exist, such as 
MeSH, Gemina Anatomy and the Minimum Anatomy 
Terminology, but these resources are not formal 
ontologies, utilizing a single relation, and therefore 
do not provide an adequate substrate for reasoning 
across species. 
Results 
Uberon is a preliminary multi-species metazoan 
anatomy ontology created primarily to fulfil two 
requirements: (1) support translational research by 
allowing comparison of phenotypes across species 
and (2) provide logical cross-product definitions for 
GO biological process terms. The first version of 
Uberon was generated automatically by aligning 
existing species-specific anatomy ontologies (ssAOs) 
and anatomical reference ontologies, and then 
partially manually curated. Uberon retains reverse 
is_a links to the ssAOs, such that these can be used 
in cross-species inferencing and queries. A term is 
generally included in Uberon if it is a generalization 
over two or more existing species-specific anatomy 
terms. For example, UBERON:dorsal_root_ganglion 
subsumes 
ZFA:dorsal_root_ganglion, 
MA:dorsal_root_ganglion, and others. Uberon is 
homology-independent, and thus contains general 
terms for analogous structures that have evolved 
multiple times, such as eye. Future versions of 
Uberon may include evolutionary relationships 
between structures, along the lines of the TAO and 
BILA ontologies. Uberon attempts to employ is_a, 
part_of, overlaps, and developmental relations in the 
same manner as ssAOs. The current version of the 
ontology has 2808 terms, and 5110 links between 
terms, and 9339 links out to other AOs (Table 1), 
1643 Wikipedia cross-references, and has been 
referenced in 682 GO cross-products.

phenotypic descriptions of genotypic effects across 
species. Uberon is available from the OBO Foundry

Towards Automatic Classification of Entities within the ChEBI Ontology 
Janna Hastings, Paula de Matos, Marcus Ennis, Christoph Steinbeck 
European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK 
Abstract 
Biochemical 'small molecules' are a core element of 
biomedical data. ChEBI provides an ontology of 
chemical entities with stable unique identifiers and 
recommended names. Recently, ChEBI introduced 
direct user submissions, and the size of the database 
is forecast to grow substantially. Description logics 
provide a candidate technology for automatic 
classification of entities. However, as the complexity 
and size of the ontology increases, the efficiency of 
available reasoning technology will need to be 
assessed. 
Background  
Appearing in a wide variety of contexts, biochemical 
'small molecules' are a core element of biomedical 
data. Chemical ontologies, which provide stable 
identifiers and a shared vocabulary for use in 
referring to such biochemical small molecules, are 
crucial to enable the interoperation of such data. One 
such chemical ontology is ChEBI (Chemical Entities 
of Biological Interest), a candidate member ontology 
of the OBO Foundry. ChEBI is a publicly available, 
manually annotated database of chemical entities and 
contains around 18000 annotated entities as of the 
last release (May 2009). ChEBI provides stable 
unique identifiers for chemical entities; a controlled 
vocabulary in the form of recommended names 
(which are unique and unambiguous), common 
synonyms, and systematic chemical names; cross-
references to other databases; and a structural and 
role-based classification within the ontology. ChEBI 
is widely used for annotation of chemicals within 
biological 
databases, 
text-mining, 
and 
data 
integration. ChEBI can be accessed online at 
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/ and the full dataset is 
available for download in various formats including 
SDF and OBO. 
Automated Classification 
The selection of chemical entities for inclusion in the 
ChEBI database is user-driven. As the use of ChEBI 
has grown, so too has the backlog of user-requested 
entries. Inevitably, the annotation backlog creates a 
bottleneck, and to speed up the annotation process, 
ChEBI has recently released a submission tool which 
allows community submissions of chemical entities, 
groups, and classes. However, classification of 
chemical entities within the ontology is a difficult 
and niche activity, and it is unlikely that the 
community as a whole will be able or willing to 
correctly and consistently classify each submitted 
entity, creating required classes where they are 
missing. As a result, it is likely that while the size of 
the database grows, the ontological classification will 
become less sophisticated, unless the classification of 
new entities is assisted computationally. In addition, 
the ChEBI database is expecting substantial size 
growth in the next year, so automatic classification, 
which has up till now not been possible, is urgently 
required. Automatic classification would also enable 
the ChEBI ontology classes to be applied to other 
compound databases such as PubChem. 
Description Logic Reasoning 
Description logic based reasoning technology is a 
prime candidate for development of such an 
automatic classification system as it allows the rules 
of the classification system to be encoded within the 
knowledgebase. Already at 18000 entities, ChEBI is 
a fair size for a real-world application of description 
logic reasoning technology, and as the ontology is 
enhanced with a richer density of asserted 
relationships, the classification will become more 
complex and challenging. We have successfully 
tested a description logic-based classification of 
chemical entities based on specified structural 
properties using the hypertableaux-based HermiT 
reasoner, and found it to be sufficiently efficient to be 
feasible for use in a production environment on a 
database of the size that ChEBI is now. However, 
much work still remains to enrich the ChEBI 
knowledgebase itself with the properties needed to 
provide the formal class definitions for use in the 
automated classification, and to assess the efficiency 
of 
the 
available 
description 
logic 
reasoning 
technology on a database the size of ChEBI's forecast 
future growth.

Abstract 
The 
collaborative, 
community-based 
Vaccine 
Ontology (VO) was developed to promote vaccine 
data standardization, integration, and computer-
assisted reasoning. Currently VO covers a variety of 
aspects of the vaccine domain, with an emphasis on 
classification of vaccines and vaccine components, 
and on host immune response to vaccines. VO can be 
used for a number of applications, e.g., ontology-
based 
vaccine 
literature 
mining 
through 
collaboration 
with 
the 
National 
Center 
for 
Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). 
Introduction 
Vaccination is the most important invention to 
prevent various diseases and improve public health. 
With extensive vaccine research and clinical usages, 
it has become challenging to standardize vaccine 
annotation, integrate information about varied 
vaccine 
types, 
and 
support 
computer-assisted 
reasoning. To address this challenge, we developed 
the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO; 
www.violinet.org/vaccineontology). 
Results of VO Development  
As of June 8, 2009, VO contains 1802 classes, 192 
object properties, and 13 datatype properties. Among 
these terms, 934 classes and 19 properties are 
assigned VO-specific IDs. In addition, VO includes 
38 classes from the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO; 
www.ifomis.org/bfo) as upper-level framework, 24 
terms from Relation Ontology (RO), 37 classes from 
Ontology for Biomedical Investigation (OBI), and 
many terms from other ontologies. VO development 
follows 
the 
OBO 
Foundry 
principles 
(obofoundry.org/crit.shtml).  
VO has defined ‘vaccine’ as a ‘processed material’ 
that is prepared and used to protect against a 
pathogen organism or a disease (e.g., cancer). For 
example, the vaccine Fluvirin has the following 
hierarchical structure by definition: vaccine -> viral 
vaccine -> Influenza virus vaccine -> Fluvirin. More 
than 300 licensed vaccines and vaccine candidates in 
research or clinical trials have been described in VO. 
Vaccine components, vaccination protocols, and host 
responses to vaccination are also major focuses of 
current VO development.  
VO can be used for a number of applications. For 
example, VO dramatically improves PubMed vaccine 
literature searching and is being applied to the 
development of an ontology-based vaccine literature 
mining system through collaboration with NCIBI. 
Vaccine-specific 
immune 
networks 
are 
being 
investigated using ontology-specific literature mining 
and advanced statistical methods.   
Discussion 
VO will include all licensed vaccines in different 
countries and regions, as well as all possible vaccines 
in clinical trials and in research for major diseases. 
Planned future development of the VO will add 
further details such as clinical trials of vaccine, 
vaccine surveillance, and safety reports. VO will 
allow advanced integration and intelligent analysis of 
large amounts of worldwide vaccine data.

Abstract 
We introduce a basic ontology of functions and 
dispositions. The theory we suggest is developed as 
module of the General Formal Ontology, and is 
compatible both with major philosophical theories 
of biological functions and with most top-level 
ontologies. The particular focus of the suggested 
formalism is on the inference of causal relationships 
from 
function

and 
the 
explicit 
formalization of the normal character of functions 
using 
non-monotonic 
forms 
of 
knowledge 
representation. 
The question of functions in biology is a major topic 
in the philosophy of biology and also continues to be 
of importance in applied biological sciences. 
Identifying the functions of proteins, DNA or RNA 
fragments, as well as the ontogenesis of their 
functions throughout evolution, remain a central topic 
of research. Inquiries into the nature of functions can 
reveal methods for determining the functions of 
specific entities, for distinguishing multiple functions 
of one entity, or can provide frameworks for 
describing the evolution of functions over time.  
Theories pertaining to the ontology of function range 
from reductions to causality to explanations based on 
social ascription. In the context of formal ontology, 
function 
is 
investigated 
in 
several 
top-level 
ontologies, such as BFO and GFO. We provide a 
formal ontological account of function which is 
compatible with several top-level ontologies. For this 
purpose, we investigate the difference between 
dispositions and functions and propose a means to 
interrelate both kinds of entities using methods from 
artificial intelligence research, in particular non-
monotonic reasoning.  
The Ontology of Functions (OF)1 provides an account 
of how to represent functions and how to represent 
their relations to other entities such as processes and 
objects. The basic assumption is that functional 
knowledge can be represented and described 
independently of the realization of function. In the 
OF, a function structure is described by a label, 
requirements, a goal and a functional item. The label 
is a non-formal name or description of the function. 
The requirement is a situation type whose instances 
must be present for every realization of the function. 
The goal is a situation type whose instances describe 
the states of the world that the function is supposed to 
cause or otherwise bring about. The functional item 
describes the role that entities with the function play, 
selecting all features of the entity that are essential to 
the function realization. 
The theories on function differ in how they analyze 
the has-function relation. However, there are causal 
facts that should be exhibited by any functional entity 
in most of these theories: the function-bearing entity 
must normally be able to cause the goal of the 
function given the requirements of the function. 
To formalize this observation, we use an additional 
entity in the ontology of functions. We call this a 
disposition. An individual e has the disposition d to 
cause Tgoal iff e causes an instance of Tgoal whenever e 
is placed in the right circumstances2. 
We suggest that for every function F there is a 
category 
D 
of 
dispositions 
with 
the 
same 
requirements and goals as F such that every 
individual e having a function f::F normally has a 
disposition d::D, and formalize this condition using 
predicate circumscription3. 
The ontological theory of function we have developed 
is intended to be compatible both with a wide range 
of philosophical theories on function and with most 
upper-level ontologies. It permits the inference of 
causal relations from function ascription, a feature of 
particular importance in biological ontologies.

What’s in an ‘is a’ Link 
William R. Hogan 
UPMC and University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA 
Introduction 
Several researchers have demonstrated that current 
medical terminologies and ontologies use relations in 
inconsistent and ambiguous ways,1 despite Woods’ 
seminal work that first illustrated the problem.2 
The goal of the present work is to catalog the 
different ways in which SNOMED CT uses the is a 
relation. The rationale for creating the catalog is to 
serve as a basis for systematically improving the 
semantics of terminologies and ontologies so as to 
improve their accessibility to machine inference. 
Methods 
I reviewed the literature to find ontological mistakes 
that change the interpretation of the is a relation, 
without respect to any particular terminology. I then 
reviewed the stated relationships table of SNOMED 
CT, Jan 2009 version, placing them into categories 
from the literature, and creating new categories when 
existing categories did not apply. 
Results 
I found nine categories of misuse of the is_a relation 
in SNOMED CT (Table), eight from the literature 
and one from my analysis. SNOMED CT had an 
example of every misuse found in the literature. 
Discussion 
The January 2009 version of SNOMED CT violates 
its intended interpretation of the is_a relation, which 
is nearly identical to the definition of Smith et al.1 I 
cataloged nine categories of misuse of is_a, and 
found an example of each in SNOMED CT.  
This study demonstrates for the first time that (1) 
common ontological mistakes lead to ambiguity in 
the interpretation of is a, (2) the stated relationships 
of SNOMED CT are the source of mistakes in the use 
of the is a relation, (3) SNOMED CT has at least one 
example of every problem with is a elucidated from 
the broader literature.

NIFSTD: A Comprehensive Ontology for Neuroscience 
 Fahim T. Imam, Sarah M. Maynard, Maryann E. Martone,  
Stephen D. Larson, Amarnath Gupta, Jeffrey S. Grethe  
University of California, San Diego, CA, USA  
Abstract 
As a core component of Neuroscience Information 
Framework (NIF) project, NIF Standard (NIFSTD) 
was envisioned as a set of modular ontologies that 
provide a comprehensive collection of terminologies 
to describe neuroscience relevant data and resources. 
We present here on the structure, design principles 
and current state of NIFSTD. 
Introduction 
The NIFSTD is a critical constituent in the NIF 
project (http://neuinfo.org) to enable an effective 
concept-based search mechanism against a diverse 
collection of neuroscience resources. The overall 
ontology has been assembled in a form that promotes 
reuse of standard ontologies in biomedical domain, 
easy extension and modification during its evolution.  
Basic Structure and Design Principles  
The NIFSTD is constructed according to best 
practices closely followed by the Open Biological 
Ontology (OBO) community. It was built in a 
modular fashion, each covering a distinct orthogonal 
neuroscience relevant domain (e.g., anatomy, cells, 
molecules, 
experimental 
techniques, 
digital 
resources). NIFSTD avoids duplication of efforts by 
conforming to standards that promote reuse. The 
modules are standardized to the same upper level 
ontologies, the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), OBO 
Relations Ontology (OBO-RO), and the Ontology of 
Phenotypic Qualities (PATO). Expressed in OWL­
DL, NIFSTD is computationally decidable. NIFSTD 
follows the single inheritance principle but classes 
with multiple parents are derivable via automated 
reasoning on logically defined classes. Entities in 
NIFSTD are named via unique identifiers and are 
accompanied by a rich set of annotation properties. 
NIFSTD reuses object properties from standard 
ontologies (e.g., OBO-RO) to express the Intra­
module and cross-module relations among classes. 
Within the NIF, NIFSTD is served through an 
ontology management system called OntoQuest. 
OntoQuest generates an OWL-compliant relational 
schema and supports operations for navigating, path 
finding, hierarchy exploration, and term searching in 
ontological graphs. We strive to balance between the 
involvement of the neuroscience community for 
domain 
expertise 
and 
knowledge 
engineering 
community for ontology expertise when constructing 
the NIFSTD. The wiki version of NIFSTD, 
NeuroLex (http://neurolex.org) has been developed 
as the easy entry point for the community to access, 
edit and enhance the core lexicon. 
Current State 
We have released the 1.0 version of NIFSTD 
(http://purl.org/nif/ontology/nif.owl), 
built 
upon 
release 0.51. Version 0.5 was assembled from various 
external sources and had several shortcomings. 
Compare the 0.5, Improvements in 1.0 include: 
reduction of modular dependencies into minimum, a 
re-engineered import hierarchy to eliminate the 
redundant imports, elimination of duplicate classes 
due to multiple imports, normalization of the 
modules to create cleaner hierarchies, additional 
module for chemicals (reusing neuroscience relevant 
terms from CHEBI ontology) and resource types, and 
enrichment of contents (e.g., additional classes, 
synonyms, and other annotations) from NeuroLex. 
Although NIF relies on existing terminologies rather 
than re-invention, we do provide neuroscience-
specific content where required. For example, the 
NIF cell module has largely been created by the NIF 
cell working group. 
Conclusion 
Currently covering about 20,000 concepts including 
both classes and synonyms, the NIFSTD continues to 
evolve to incorporate new modules and contents as 
well as implementing more detailed and useful cross-
domain relations that follow ontology development 
best practices.

LBFO: Toward an Artificial Language for Ontology Development 
Leonard F. Jacuzzo 
National Center for Biomedical Ontology, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA 
The syntax of LBFo represents the initial step toward 
the creation of a rigorously characterized, recursively 
defined, artificial language for the sole purpose of 
ontology development. The underlying idea is that 
maximally fruitful application of ontology requires 
accurate representation of reality in accordance with 
current textbook science. Hence, creating a robust, 
accurate representation of reality is a fundamental 
concern.  
An ontology represents general types of entities and 
relations 
between 
them. A 
domain 
ontology 
represents the general types and relations for a given 
domain of research. A top-level ontology represents 
the general types of entities in any domain of 
research. Ontologies serve many purposes in 
computerized collection, management, and storage of 
data. 
These applications include enhancement of 
storage and retrieval in a data system, integration of 
diverse systems, integration of semantic content on 
the web, and annotation of publications in a library 
setting. 
Successful application of ontologies has led to the 
creation of languages with the special purpose of 
implementing ontologies. A formalized ontology is an 
ontology 
expressed 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
grammatical formation rules of an artificial language. 
Some existing ontology languages have been 
developed in order to serve specific functions that 
require expressibility limitations and expression of 
information in a manner that contributes to human 
misunderstanding and error. The most potentially 
detrimental effect is risked when an ontology is 
constructed in a language designed exclusively for 
computerized implementation. The result is a skewed 
representation of salient features of reality. An 
ontology development language has two purposes: 
one is to represent reality as accurately and 
completely as possible, the other is to achieve this in 
a 
manner 
that 
facilitates 
computerized 
implementation: these goals conflict. Validation 
requires expert human consensus, hence, an ontology 
should be developed in a language that is 
understandable to domain experts. However, such a 
language must be computer tractable, i.e., there must 
be a correspondence between the information 
expressed with a sentence and its grammatical 
structure such that information can be processed on 
the basis of syntax alone. 
LBFO represents the initial step toward the creation of 
a rigorously characterized, recursively defined, 
artificial language for the sole purpose of ontology 
development. The underlying idea is that maximally 
fruitful application of ontology requires accurate 
representation of reality in accordance with current 
textbook science. Hence, creating a robust, accurate 
representation of reality is a fundamental concern. 
LBFO will facilitate providing definitions and 
characterizations of features of reality in a way 
conformant with BFO thus ensuring maximal rigor 
and clarity. Since LBFO is a multi-sorted language, 
LBFO has resources to represent the ontological 
categories found in BFO and the universals defined 
in their terms in an economical and at the same time 
user-friendly way. 
Capitalized variables range over universals, while 
lower-case 
variables 
range 
over 
individuals. 
Universal constants are upper-case. Individual 
constants are lower-case. The syntax of LBFO also 
distinguishes in a straightforward manner between 
variables for continuants, processes, and times. The 
syntax 
of 
LBFO 
contains 
precisely 
expressed 
grammatical-formation rules, so that its variables 
cannot be combined in a manner that results in 
category errors. The predicates of LBFO are such that 
the 
ontological 
category 
from 
which 
terms 
representing entities can be taken as arguments is 
specified in advance. Sentences which express 
category errors are not grammatically correct in LBFO. 
LBFO can serve as a bridge between domain experts, 
knowledge engineers, and implementation languages. 
The semantic apparatus of an FOL system serves as 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
models 
developed 
for 
implementation languages such as OWL and RDF. 
FOL is also a segregated dialect of Common Logic so 
there is a link to that international standard; hence, 
there is potential to develop middle-ware that maps 
LBFO to the variety of implementation languages that 
exist both now and in the future. 
Though there is much work to be done in perfecting 
LBFO, this first step in the process provides hope for 
achieving the goal of facilitating maximally accurate, 
rigorous representations of general features of reality.

NeuroLex.org: 
A NIF Standard Ontology-Based Semantic Wiki for Neuroscience 
Stephen D. Larson, Sarah M. Maynard, Fahim Imam, Maryann E. Martone 
University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA 
Abstract 
Bridging the domain knowledge of a scientific 
community and the knowledge engineering skills of 
the ontology community is still an imperfect practice. 
Within the field of neuroscience, we have tried to 
close this gap by presenting an ontology through the 
medium of a wiki where each page corresponds to a 
class. By opening it to the World Wide Web, we have 
made the process of maintaining a ~20,000 concept 
neuroscience ontology (NIFSTD), more collaborative. 
Introduction 
The neuroscience community needs its basic domain 
concepts organized into a coherent framework. 
Ontologies provide an important medium for 
reconciling knowledge into a portable and machine 
readable form. For many years we have been 
building community ontologies for neuroscience, 
first through the Biomedical Informatics Research 
Network and now through the Neuroscience 
Information Framework projects (http://neuinfo.org). 
These projects resulted in the construction of a large 
modular ontology, constructed by importing existing 
ontologies where possible, called NIFSTD1. One of 
the largest roadblocks that we encountered was the 
lack of tools for domain experts to view, edit and 
contribute their knowledge to NIFSTD. Existing 
editing tools were difficult to use or required expert 
knowledge to employ. By combining several open 
source technologies related to semantic wikis and 
NIFSTD1, we have created NeuroLex.org, the first 
semantic wiki for neuroscience.   
Methods 
NeuroLex.org is built on top of the open source 
Semantic Mediawiki platform2. This allows classes, 
properties, and instances to be represented within a 
wiki which is easily editable and allows the content 
of that wiki to be exported as OWL. Semantic 
Mediawiki makes querying the ontology via 
properties or class hierarchy very straightforward. In 
addition, we have incorporated tools such as 
Semantic Forms, which allow the ontology classes to 
be edited as a form rather than as a wiki page with 
special text mark-up. Some of the fields in the form 
support autocomplete which allows users to populate 
those fields with other classes from the ontology.   
Results 
NeuroLex.org has evolved into a powerful platform 
for collaboratively maintaining and extending the 
NIFSTD ontology. We have been able to incorporate 
user feedback and create custom views of the 
ontology content with very rapid turnaround. Table 1 
shows some key metrics that we have collected on its 
usage. The content contributed to the Neurolex is not 
directly added to NIFSTD, but is incorporated into 
the NIFSTD OWL file by a knowledge engineer after 
curation by the NIF ontology group.

Conclusion 
We conclude that the Semantic Mediawiki is a good 
starting point for the collaborative maintenance of 
ontologies. Other groups are also using a similar 
approach, e.g., BioMedGT3 . While we are still 
working through some issues, e.g., synchronizing the 
NIFSTD with the content on NeuroLex, exporting 
and importing OWL, and bulk uploading concepts, 
we believe that semantic wikis are a good tool for 
providing community contribution and feedback to 
projects like NIF.

The Role of Bio-Ontologies in Data-Driven Research: 
A Philosophical Perspective 
Sabina Leonelli 
ESRC Centre for Genomics in Society, University of Exeter, UK 
Abstract 
This project aims to reach a philosophical 
understanding of the role played by theory in the 
practices of data dissemination and re-use that 
characterise data-driven research. Bio-ontologies 
have the potential to play the epistemic role of 
theories in this context, insofar as they (1) express the 
knowledge underlying data-driven research and (2) 
guide such research towards future discoveries. 
Introduction: Data-Driven Research 
Up to the second half of the 20th century, biological 
data were largely produced as evidence to support 
given hypotheses. The activity of data gathering has 
since 
become 
increasingly 
automated 
and 
technology-driven. It is argued that the extraction of 
knowledge from automatically generated data may 
constitute a new, ‘data-driven’ approach to scientific 
methods.1 This project examines the characteristics 
and significance of data-driven research from a 
philosophical perspective. If data-driven research 
constitutes 
a 
distinctive 
mode 
of 
knowledge 
production, how can it be characterised and how does 
it relate to hypothesis-driven research? To answer 
these questions, I focus on the epistemic role played 
by bio-ontologies in facilitating data re-use. 
The Epistemic Roles of Bio-Ontologies 
In their quality of classification systems, bio­
ontologies fulfil a representational and a heuristic 
role in data-driven research. 
(1) Bio-ontologies constitute representational maps 
of the biological knowledge underlying data-
driven research. 
Their aim is to represent what is currently known 
about biological entities or processes, in order to 
further the study of those entities and processes 
through coordination among research projects and 
exchange of relevant data, protocols and materials.2 
Thanks to their precisely defined terms, bio­
ontologies explicitly formulate knowledge that is 
taken to be widely assumed, yet is usually dispersed 
across publications and research groups. These maps 
need not be true or universal;3 rather, they need to 
capture the assumptions and practices underlying the 
successful sharing and re-use of biomedical data.4 
(2) Bio-ontologies 
 constitute 
a 
network 
of 
theoretical 
hypotheses 
guiding 
data-driven 
research towards future discoveries. 
The definitions assigned to bio-ontology terms are 
modified depending on research developments. At the 
same time, the adoption of specific terms and 
definitions shapes how data are used in new research 
contexts.5 They inform their users’ understanding of 
how phenomena are defined beyond their own field.6 
They also define the evidential scope of the datasets 
classified and distributed through databases.7 
Conclusion: Bio-Ontologies as Theories 
The definitions used to disambiguate bio-ontology 
terms play the epistemic role traditionally assigned to 
hypotheses: they are descriptions of phenomena that 
are relied upon when planning new research, are open 
to further testing and modified on the basis of new 
findings. Bio-ontologies are biological theories 
suitable for the discovery of new facts.

Developing an Application Ontology for Annotation of Experimental Variables 
(Experimental Factor Ontology) 
James Malone, Tomasz Adamusiak, Ele Holloway, Helen Parkinson  
European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK  
Abstract 
The 
Experimental 
Factor 
Ontology 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo) is an application focused 
ontology modelling the experimental factors in 
ArrayExpress1. The ontology has been developed to 
increase the richness of the annotations that are 
currently made in the ArrayExpress1 repository, to 
promote consistent annotation, to facilitate automatic 
annotation and to integrate external data. The 
methodology employed in the development of EFO 
involves construction of mappings to multiple 
existing domain specific ontologies, such as the 
Disease Ontology and Cell Type Ontology.  
Methodology 
Figure 1. EFO axes.  
EFO is organised around five main axes (Figure 1).  
Manual curation and semi-automated text mining are 
used to map EFO classes to other bioontology efforts 
that exist in the domain (Figure 2). 
EFO has prototyped the use of agent technology to 
automate some aspects of ontology validation. All the 
supporting ontology tools are available on the 
http://efo.sf.net website.  
The driving use case in developing EFO is based on 
the need for annotating experimental data in 
ArrayExpress1. These include, query expansion, data 
visualisation/integration, and nonsense detection.

Abstract 
To facilitate broad interoperability for phenotype 
information between different ontological frameworks, 
we developed a reference ontology, PATO2YATO_ 
Quality, with the careful mapping of terms of PATO 
which is a quality ontology commonly used for 
biological phenotype annotation to the latest top-
level ontology, YATO, which represents advanced 
modeling of quality-related concepts. This represents 
of interrelationships among quality-related concepts 
to provide fully integration of qualitative values and 
quantitative values obtained from phenotyping 
experiments and advanced representation of more 
detailed quality description. 
Introduction 
The description of qualities is a core issue for the 
integration of biological phenotype information. The 
Phenotype Quality Ontology (PATO) provides a 
practical basis for the integration of phenotype 
information across species. Typically, it is used for 
“entity 
plus 
quality” 
(E+Q) 
annotation 
of 
experimental parameters and parameter values1. 
However, there are multiple different methods of 
quality description recommended by the different 
top-level ontologies2. 
Recently, Yet Another Top-level Ontology (YATO) 
has been developed3,4. YATO represents not only 
ordinal quality descriptions covered by DOLCE and 
GALEN but also advanced quality descriptions not 
covered them. For the realization of more broad 
interoperability and advanced quality description of 
phenotypic quality using PATO terms, we developed 
a reference ontology called “PATO2YATO_Quality”. 
Results 
We have worked out mapping of terms in the 
PATO2YATO framework by the careful examination 
with the helps of flags for subset of “attribute slim” 
and “value slim” embed in OBO format file of PATO 
as the remains of previous version. In this ongoing 
work, we currently have mapped about 500 terms of 
version 1.132 of PATO (quality_v1.132.obo) to YATO:  
(UpperOntology090112.ont: http://www.ei.sanken.osaka­
u.ac.jp/hozo/onto_library/upperOnto.htm).  
In PATO2YATO_Quality, quality-related concepts 
(dependent entities) are arranged as two hierarchies, 
“Quality type” and “Quality value”, both of these are 
essential for an ontologically correct description of a 
change in quality. Furthermore, it allows systematic 
integration of numerical scales values and detailed 
representation such as <patient_1, diarrhea, yes> and 
<tail of mouse_1, short, severe>. We have started 
discussion with PATO developers to establish certain 
interoperability between two ontologies.  
PATO2YATO_Quality is available at:  
http://www.brc.riken.jp/lab/bpmp/Ontologies/PATO 
2YATO/P2Y_Quality.html. Its OWL version, exported 
from Hozo, will be available soon.  
Conclusion 
We worked out mapping of PATO terms to the YATO 
framework, and successfully represented both the 
advanced meaning of each concept and the 
interrelationships among them.

Ontology Relating Human Neurodegenerative Disease 
to Associated Animal Model Phenotypes

Abstract 
We have developed a multi-scale ontology and 
knowledge base from literature and light and electron 
microscopic observations of animal models and 
human disease. We created a model  for phenotype 
descriptions, formalized in Web Ontology Language 
(OWL), which draws entities from the Neuroscience 
Information 
Framework 
ontologies 
(NIFSTD, 
http:www.neuinfo.org/about/vocabularies.shtml) and 
Ontology 
of 
Phenotypic 
Qualities 
(PATO, 
http:obofoundry.org/egi-bin/detail.cgi?id=quality). 
The knowledge base has been loaded into the Open 
Biological 
Data 
Ontologies 
Database 
(http://www.berkeleybop.org/OBDUI) 
which 
statistically compares models and human disorders. 
Introduction 
Neurodegenerative diseases have a wide and complex 
range of biological and clinical symptoms. While 
neurodegenerative diseases share many pathological 
features, they each contain unique signatures in 
targeted cellular and subcellular structures. Animal 
models are key to translational research, yet typically 
replicate only a subset of disease features that may be 
only indirectly related to the human disease. 
Additionally, a given animal model may also map 
onto more than one condition. We employ formal 
descriptions of structural phenotypes associated with 
neurodegenerative disorders and animal models to 
provide a more effective means of matching animal 
models to diseases. We focus on multi-scale 
anatomical data, providing relationships among 
structural phenotypes at different scales. 
Results 
Creating ontologies for diseases is a significant 
informatics challenge because of the complex nature 
of disease1. Rather than focusing on a disease 
process, we focus phenotypes: any observable or 
measurable feature associated with an organism. 
Each phenotype is constructed from the combination 
of 
biological 
entities 
from 
the 
Neuroscience 
Information Framework (NIF, http://neuinfo.org) and 
qualities from the Ontology of Phenotypic Qualities 
(PATO) (Figure 1). 
Figure 1. Phenotype Template. 
We 
generated 
phenotype 
statements 
from 
observations made by basic and clinical researchers 
in literature and observations of animal models made 
from biological images. Human disease phenotypes 
are defined classes in the Neurodegenerative Disease 
Phenotype 
Ontology 
(NDPO, 
http://www.ccdb.ucsd.edu/NDPO/1.0/NDPO.owl). We 
collect instances in the Phenotype Knowledge Base 
(PKB, http://www.ccdb.ucsd.edu/PKB/1.0/PKB.owl). 
Phenotypes were loaded into the Open Biological 
Data repository (OBD) which conducts statistical 
comparisons of phenotypes using information content 
and semantic similarity. For example, OBD captures 
the similarity between a human Lewy Body and an 
alpha-synuclein inclusion in a mouse. 
Conclusion 
Using NIF and PATO we have provided a template 
for phenotype descriptions that can be applied to 
neurological diseases. By using a consistent model 
for description, we can aggregate data from multiple 
animal models into a common data model (OBD), 
facilitating comparative analysis2. Through underlying 
ontologies, we can provide some of the necessary 
knowledge to bridge descriptions made in animal 
models from basic research and descriptions of 
pathological features in clinical preparations.

Towards a Modular Ontology for Annotating Structured Imagery Reports: 
Early Experiments in Bone and Joint Diseases

Abstract 
We aim to build a modular ontology to assist 
radiologists to annotate their osteoarticular case 
reports. In this paper, we introduce the major 
outlines of our work: a description model of 
radiologists annotation viewpoints, the modular 
ontology building approach by reusing existing 
ontologies and early experiments with a prototype of 
a specific annotation tool. 
Introduction 
In medical imagery, considerable structured reports 
are produced in a digital form (doc, html, xml, dicom 
sr...). To take advantage of this expansion and to 
improve radiologists diagnostics, ontology-based 
annotation tools can be proposed. 
Outlines of work in progress  
A description model of radiologists annotations 
viewpoints: 
Firstly, we consider for the radiologist the most 
relevant annotation viewpoints of its structured 
reports (textual information and images). We propose 
six abstract levels: patient context (name, old, weight, 
types of modality...), visual descriptors (color, 
texture, form, spatial characteristics...), technics (area 
of interest, segmented zone...), anatomy (organs 
structure...) pathological results (diseases, signs...) 
and recommendations1. 
Ontology reuse to build our modular ontology:  
In medecine, ontologies are not widely used in 
annotation tools2. This is why we aim to build a 
modular ontology that will allow radiologists to 
annotate their imagery reports with the respect of the 
viewpoints description model. Because no existing 
ontologies can meet our needs, our approach consists 
in: the evaluation of an existing ontology in bone and 
joint domain, the modularization of this ontology in 
accordance with the proposed description model 
(Figure 1) and an adequate extraction tool, the 
development from scratch of the relevant missed 
knowledge, the enrichment of several parts by 
reusing existing ontologies and finally trying to unify 
six modules in a particular way.            
Figure 1. A sketch of our modular ontology 
Early Experiments 
We developed a prototype of a bilingual annotation 
tool which can load and visualize the modules 
extracted from a specific modular ontology. After 
charging an existing report (dicom sr or html), many 
functionnalities are offered: a multiaxial loading of 
owl ontologies (related to the six abstract levels), a 
visualization of interesting modules according to an 
arborescence view, a textual description for each 
ontology element, multi-selected text annotations, 
image panel tools for selection, showing previous 
existing annotations to help the radiologist, deleting 
or modifying existing annotations, etc.1 
Perspectives 
Several questions arise around our modularization 
building method. A classification of existing 
ontologies is imperative. Keeping a check on the 
reusing possibilities and then on their heterogeneities 
are also initial research tracks.

Abstract 
The Phenoscape project is developing ontologies and 
tools to integrate morphological and genomic data to 
address comparative questions in evolutionary 
biology. We are currently curating 81 publications 
describing ~5000 phenotypic characters in 4,000 
species of Ostariophysian fishes, and will be making 
our 
database 
of 
ontology-based 
annotations 
concurrently with this meeting via a web-based 
interface at http://kb.phenoscape.org. 
Introduction 
Until recently, biological ontologies have either 
focused on single model organisms, or, like the Gene 
Ontology, attempted to span the tree of life.. 
Phenoscape is a project to develop ontologies and a 
database to describe the phenotypes of members of 
the the Ostariophysi, a large group (>9,000 species) 
of teleost fish.  Ultimately, the database, ontologies 
and associated tools will allow us to apply reasoning 
to queries over zebrafish mutant phenotypes and 
“evolutionary” phenotypes across the Ostariophysi.  
Ontologies  
We have built two ontologies: the Teleost Anatomy 
Ontology (TAO) and the Teleost Taxonomy Ontology 
(TTO). We also constructed an ontology of 
taxonomic ranks and contributed terms to several 
existing OBO ontologies (e.g., Evidence Codes, 
PATO, etc.).The TAO is a multispecies ontology of 
anatomical terms. It was derived from, and is 
regularly synchronized with, the zebrafish anatomy 
ontology that is maintained by the Zebrafish 
Information Network (ZFIN). We have added, with 
input from the ichthyological community, over 400 
terms since the TAO was cloned from the ZFIN 
anatomy ontology in September 2007. The TTO is 
an ontology of taxonomic names of groups within the 
teleost fishes. It includes all species and genera from 
the Catalog of Fishes database and additional taxa 
mentioned in papers we curated. 
Curation of evolutionary phenotypes requires use and 
extension of the OBO phenotype ontology (PATO), 
evidence code ontology (ECO), relation ontology 
(RO), and spatial ontology (SO). 
Curation 
We have selected an initial set of 81 papers for 
curation, based on the availability of phenotype data 
in evolutionary character matrices with the added 
goal of covering as many Ostariophysan species as 
possible. Curation has been performed both by 
Phenoscape personnel and domain experts in the 
ichthyological community. 
The curation process consists of identifying and 
requesting necessary additions to the ontologies, 
followed 
by 
annotating 
reported 
evolutionary 
phenotypes of species in the paper using the Entity-
Quality (EQ) syntax. We will construct over eight 
million EQ annotations from the initial 81 papers. 
EQ statements are constructed with the Phenex tool, 
an enhanced and extended version of Phenote. 
Phenote is also used to construct statements of 
homology (identity of structures in different species 
by common descent). 
Knowledge-Base and Webservices 
Our annotations are stored in a database based on the 
OBD database schema with the mutant phenotypes, 
genes and other data from the zebrafish community 
database (zfin.org). Because both data sets include 
ontology-based phenotypes, they can be integrated in 
the Phenoscape web interface. Examples of queries 
immediately possible are finding candidate genes 
underlying the evolution of morphological characters 
and searches to discover similar phenotypes among 
different taxa. A publicly available web interface and 
services will be available, concurrent with this 
meeting at http://kb.phenoscape.org.  
Conclusion 
The Phenoscape project has developed an ontology-
based generalizable system for addressing questions 
that span the domains of developmental and 
evolutionary biology.  It makes possible examining 
phenotype evolution at a large scale.

Abstract 
The Protein Ontology (PRO) provides a formal 
representation of protein objects within the OBO 
Foundry, consisting both of descriptions of these 
objects and of the relationships between them. Here 
we describe upcoming developments in PRO; 
namely, the inclusion of species-specific protein 
forms, expansion of the ID space, and—in 
conjunction with the Gene Ontology and the pathway 
databases Reactome and MouseCyc—the extension 
to protein complexes. 
Introduction 
OBO Foundry ontologies are organized along the 
dimensions of granularity (molecule to population) 
and relation to time (objects, qualities, processes). 
Within this scheme, the Protein Ontology is a 
representation of protein objects at the single 
molecule level of granularity, treating the protein 
molecules themselves rather than some property of 
the molecules (such as function, location, types of 
post-translational modification, etc.). Such properties 
are instead handled by other ontologies such as the 
Gene Ontology (GO)1 and the Protein Modification 
Ontology (PSI-MOD);2 PRO provides the objects to 
which such properties can be attached.3,4 PRO 
encompasses a sub-ontology of proteins based on 
evolutionary relatedness (ProEvo), and a sub-
ontology of the multiple protein forms produced from 
a given gene locus (ProForm) (Figure 1).  
Figure 1. PRO organization and inter-ontology connections. 
To date the curation of PRO focused on providing a 
deep hierarchy and annotation for proteins encoded 
by a small number of genes from humans and mice 
only, where the translation products from mRNA 
splice isoforms that were deemed equivalent in both 
species were given a single species-neutral term. 
PRO also did not address the associations that 
proteins make in living cells. 
Recently the Protein Ontology Consortium hosted a 
workshop focusing on the user community and how 
best to maximize the usefulness and adoption of 
PRO. The outcome pointed to three needs: (1) a 
greatly expanded ID space for genes not deeply 
annotated, including those from other model 
organisms; (2) species-specific terms to supplement 
the species-neutral terms; and (3) terms denoting 
specific protein complexes to supplement the neutral 
terms in GO. In this presentation we describe our 
preliminary and forthcoming work to address these 
needs.

OBI: Ontology for Biomedical Investigations 
The OBI Consortium, http://purl.obofoundry.org/obo/obi  
Abstract 
OBI, the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, is 
being engineered by a set of domain experts 
encompassing a wide array of biomedical science 
disciplines. The scope of this ontological effort is to 
close a gap in coverage in resources available to 
annotate scientific experimental practice and make it 
coincide with the evidence-based biology paradigm. 
Introduction 
The OBI consortium endorses the OBO Foundry 
principles.1 
Those 
guidelines 
have 
positively 
impacted the work. First, by encouraging an open 
and inclusive approach, the OBI group proactively 
seeks partners and may act as an accretion point, 
avoiding work fragmentation. Second, by insisting on 
documentation, working practices are made explicit 
for a decentralized yet consistent development. OBI 
aims at representing various experimental processes 
(investigation, study, assay), the study design, the 
protocols and instrumentation used, the material 
used, the data generated and the type of analysis 
performed on the data. OBI supports the consistent 
annotation of biomedical experiments regardless of 
the particular field of study.  
Results 
OBI selected the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)2 as 
its upper-level ontology, and as a result is being 
developed following 3 main axes: bfo:Process 
covering 
assays 
and 
information 
processing, 
bfo:MaterialEntity encompassing instrument and 
other materials and bfo:DependentContinuant, (with 
children such as quality, role and disposition) which 
holds entities used to possibly qualify elements of the 
first two dimensions. OBI uses the Ontology Web 
Language (OWL)3 and the Protégé editor4 as 
development environment and is organized as a 
series of working groups tackling specific sub-
domains. 
Procedures have been devised to ensure consistent 
work across branches. Thus, OBI has agreed on a 
naming convention for representational artifacts, a 
minimal set of metadata to supply when submitting 
terms or creating classes and methods both for 
merging branch outputs and for cross referencing 
OBO foundry sister ontologies (e.g. CHEBI, CL, 
GO). OBI is currently being evaluated against 
competency questions and use cases collected from 
its members. 
Biomedical experimental processes can involve 
numerous sub-processes, where each step can 
involve 
various 
material 
entities 
e.g., 
whole 
organisms, organ sections, cell culture, cell pellets, 
devices. Material entities realize distinct roles given 
the context of the process they are used in e.g. study 
subject role, host role, specimen role, patient role; 
and distinct functions e.g. measuring, separating, 
environment controlling. Use cases are employed to 
demonstrate how to model entities and their relations 
in OBI in order to describe experimental processes 
such as a blood glucose measurement assay, or a 
vaccine protection experiment. 
Conclusion 
OBI provides an approach to represent biological and 
clinical investigations in an explicit and integrative 
framework, 
which 
facilitates 
computational 
processing and semantic web compatibility.

Virtual Fly Brain: 
An Ontology-Linked Schema of the Drosophila Brain 
David Osumi-Sutherland1, Mark Longair2, J. Douglas Armstrong2  
1FlyBase, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK  
2School of Informatics, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, UK  
Abstract 
Drosophila neuro-anatomical data is scattered 
across a large, diverse literature dating back over 75 
years and a growing number of community 
databases. Lack of a standardized nomenclature for 
neuro-anatomy makes comparison and searching this 
growing data-set extremely arduous.  
A recent standardization effort1 has produced a 
segmented, 3D model of the Drosophila brain 
annotated with a controlled vocabulary. We are 
formalizing these developments to produce a web-
based ontology-linked atlas. 
This well-defined gross anatomy provides a substrate 
for defining neuronal types in the ontology according 
to where they fasciculate and innervate. Neuronal 
types are also classified in the ontology according to 
neurotransmitter released, lineage and function. The 
resulting ontology provides both a vocabulary for 
annotation and a means for integrative queries of 
neurobiological data. 
Introduction 
The Drosophila brain can be crudely described as 
consisting of tracts (bundles of axons and dendrites 
lacking synapses) and neuropil domains (discrete 
regions generally containing whole terminal arbors, 
in which axons and dendrites synapse with each 
other). The names of tracts and domains and details 
of their gross connectivity are currently being 
standardized in an atlas based on labeled 3D image 
stacks1. 
Common criteria for classification of neurons 
include: which tracts their axons are bundled 
(fasciculated) in; which neuropil domains they 
innervate; their morphology; their function; their 
circuit position; what neurotransmitter they release; 
their lineage. Large amounts of data pertaining to 
these classifications exist, but have not been 
standardized or integrated in any query-able resource. 
Results 
Terms referring to elements of the gross architecture 
of the Drosophila brain are defined with reference to 
a standard 3D segmented model generated from 
image 
stacks 
of the 
Drosophila brain. See 
http://fruitfly.inf.ed.ac.uk/brain/ for online tools to 
explore this reference brain and its relationship to 
terms in the Drosophila anatomy ontology. 
With the gross architecture of the brain defined in 
this way, we can use the resulting terms to define 
neuronal classes. General mereological relationships 
(part-hood, connectedness) are useful in defining 
relations between neuronal classes and gross 
anatomy, but are not sufficient to capture biologically 
important details (e.g.- fasciculation, innervation). 
We are developing relations to capture this 
information. For example: 
fasciculates_with – relation between a neuron and 
an axonal or dendritic bundle that its axon or dendrite 
is part of (implies mereological overlap2) 
innervates – relation between a neuron and a 
structure in which it has a synapse (implies 
mereological overlap2). 
We are also developing methods to record 
neurotransmitter released (classified according to the 
chemical ontology, CHEBI) and function (classified 
according to gene ontology biological process terms) 
and systems for asserted classification of neurons 
according to morphology and circuit position. We are 
recording lineage using existing relations. 
Conclusions and Aims 
The combined ontology and models of the 
Drosophila brain will provide the basis for an online 
atlas providing links between images and ontology 
terms and allowing OWL-DL based queries for 
neuronal classes using the criteria described here.

A Bayesian Hierarchical Model to Derive Novel Gene Networks 
from Gene Ontology Fingerprints 
Tingting Qin, Lam C. Tsoi, Andrew Lawson, Jim W. Zheng 
Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA 
Abstracts 
We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to 
identify gene networks based on the similarity score 
generated from comparing the gene ontology 
fingerprints of gene pairs. Genes in this network were 
assumed to have similar biological functions that can 
be indicated by their ontology fingerprints. Our 
results indicate that different pathways show 
consistent score threshold that allow us to distinguish 
biological relevant gene—gene connections in the 
network. 
Methodology 
The enrichment of each gene ontology (GO) term 
among PubMed abstracts linked to a human gene was 
computed to construct the ontology fingerprint for all 
human genes1. The biological relevance between 
every gene pair was then measured by a similarity 
score generated from comparing the ontology 
fingerprints of the two genes. We developed a 
Bayesian approach to model the biological relevance 
of the similarity score in order to develop gene 
networks, and we used WinBUGS to compute the 
posterior distributions of the parameters in the model 
(Figure 1). We applied our model to evaluate genes in 
Figure 1. Illustration of Bayesian model 
the KEGG pathways2 in order to study the properties 
of gene networks within biological pathways. The log 
gene-gene similarity score (y) was modeled as a 
mixture normal distribution representing similar and 
dissimilar genes, as defined by threshold ck. The jump 
parameter αi represents the biological coherence of 
gene i within biological pathway. µ* was estimated as 
the mean score of dissimilar genes. 
Results 
We were able to distinguish similarity scores among 
genes belonging to the same KEGG pathway from 
those among randomly picked, irrelevant genes. 
Moreover, the results show that there is a trend of 
consistent score threshold across different biological 
pathways, indicating that there might be a standard 
threshold to separate biological coherent genes from 
dissimilar genes by using ontology fingerprints. As a 
result, we may be able to utilize this information to 
infer new genes for biological pathways. Different 
posterior α values were also observed for different 
genes, which could give us insight about the degree 
of biological coherence of a particular gene in the 
pathway, as well as the role or biological importance 
of the gene in gene networks. The ontology 
fingerprints can then be used to further identify the 
biological relevance of each gene, known or inferred, 
in the pathway. 
Conclusion 
Applying a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyzing 
the similarity scores derived from comparing two 
genes’ ontology fingerprints provide a novel 
approach to investigate gene networks. Our model 
suggests a consistent threshold of the similarity 
scores among all KEGG pathways, which could be 
used as an indicator to distinguish the genes within 
KEGG pathways from those that are irrelevant.

Letting the Cat out of the Bag: OBO and the Semantic Web 
John E. Rose 
The Winooski Foundation, Cortland, NY, USA 
Abstract 
The tools developed to work with an expanding 
number of biomedical ontologies are all directed 
“inward,” back toward the scientists The Semantic 
Web is an effort to assign meaning to data available 
on the internet resulting in a universal platform of 
knowledge exchange. For the Open Biomedical 
Ontologies to become a part of the Semantic Web, a 
more 
“outward-looking” 
tool 
is 
required. A 
prototype, AmiGA, based on 21 ontologies with over 
600,000 terms has been constructed. 
Introduction 
Two primary approaches to combine the structure of 
the Semantic Web with content on the scale of 
Wikipedia7 have developed: (1) to start over using a 
structured vocabulary to build content with machine-
accessible semantics or (2) to extract structure from 
existing content. Semantic MediaWiki1 represents the 
first approach, and dbpedia2 the second. 
A third approach, lying somewhere between these 
extremes is also possible: create a scaffold based on 
structured vocabularies (e.g., OBO3 ontologies) and 
let users add to it in a wiki format.  
Implementation 
User input is stored in a separate database from that 
of the ontology information using a schema similar 
to, but much simpler than that of MediaWiki. Users 
are only allowed to edit the “Details” section of each 
web page. Definitions and navigation graphs are 
automatically 
generated 
from 
the 
OBO-based 
database and are not accessible to users. 
Semantic MediaWiki has a feature called “semantic 
data” that allows embedding property-value pairs on 
a page and accessing them on other pages. AmiGA 
uses the OBO feature “property_value” in this way. 
Each term in the database has a web page with a 
navigation graph generated by Graphviz4. The graph 
displays all terms that are related to the current term 
directly by an OBO relation. The user may browse 
the various hierarchies imposed by the relations. 
Similarly to Wikipedia, so-called “disambiguation” 
pages are constructed for identical term names in 
different ontologies. These pages contain the 
definition and the navigation graph for each term. 
AmiGA currently searches OBO Term names, Term 
definitions and user-edited content and returns results 
for each in separate panels. Searches can be restricted 
to the is_a, develops_from and part_of hierarchies. 
Problems 
Disambiguation pages bring up issues regarding the 
various ontologies. Some of the relate a term to the 
corresponding GO term via an xref, yet have a 
different, yet equivalent, definition. The OBO file 
format allows terms with no name tag, so that such 
terms will have to relate directly to the GO. However, 
there is still a need for disambiguation pages, because 
some ontologies may use the same term, but with 
unrelated definitions. 
Quite a few new time-related relations are proposed. 
Adopting all of these would lead to a proliferation of 
semantically identical, but lexically different terms. 
The currently used develops_from relation provides a 
surprisingly substantial amount of structure. 
There is no standard way to get the name of the 
ontology from the database. Sometimes the only 
indication of an ontology’s name is in the file name.

Abstract 
Most biomedical ontologies have been created by 
individual laboratory of origin and thus promote 
information diversity even when describing similar 
elements in the same domain. Ontology mapping 
remains a challenging issue. While annotations are 
immediate use of ontology, there is increasing 
awareness 
of 
computations 
for 
translational 
informatics. Knowledge discovery from the proposed 
model of ontology integration is demonstrated in 
vaccine ontology mapping, and identification of 
disease factors of Diabetic Nephropathy. This work is 
funded by NIH grant U54 DA021519 for the NCIBI 
and R01 LM008106. 
Introduction 
Biomedical ontology (bio-ontology) was first created 
at the laboratory of origin out of the needs for 
systematic annotation. Therefore, computing with 
logical reasoning embedded in individual bio­
ontology can be challenging due to the divergence of 
individualism, especially when mapping multiple 
bio-ontologies for knowledge discovery1. While such 
reusability 
and 
interoperability 
for 
knowledge 
transfer and discovery should be promoted, working 
with multiple bio-ontologies requires a sophisticated 
operating model that can overcome the issues of 
structural 
definition 
discrepancy 
of 
ontologies 
describing similar elements in the same domain, 
incomplete and error-prone information within an 
ontology, and bridging across different information 
layers. The framework proposed here utilizes graph 
matching theory, natural language processing, and 
ontology alignment to create a novel approach of 
ontology integration that drives ontology processing 
forward from annotations to computations, to 
translations for the next-generation translational 
informatics. 
Results 
By mapping and integrating bio-ontologies of 
different biological layers from molecular genotype 
to molecular phenotype to clinical phenotype, we 
demonstrate that bio-ontology processing plays an 
important role in knowledge discovery. More than 10 
bio-ontologies or controlled biomedical vocabulary 
systems are used in our approach (Figure 1). 
Examples of use cases given in this study are 
integration of vaccine ontology2 in health care 
research, and using ontology integration to identify 
key disease factors of Diabetic Nephropathy.

BFO/DOLCE Primitive Relation Comparison 
A. Patrice Seyed 
Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA 
Abstract 
This 
paper 
examines 
the 
primitive 
relations 
(dependence, quality, and constitution) of the BFO 
and DOLCE upper ontologies, employed in developing 
domain ontologies of the biomedical sciences. The 
strengths in both upper ontologies are examined, 
which sets a framework for developing a common 
upper ontology that utilizes the assets of both. 
Introduction 
Cross-domain reasoning with data can be achieved 
through successful integration of domain with upper 
ontology types. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)1 and 
Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive 
Engineering (DOLCE)2 are two widely used upper 
ontologies, especially for the development of 
ontologies in the biomedical sciences. BFO is based 
in realism, whose primitive relations are defined in 
the Relation Ontology (RO)3. DOLCE attempts to 
capture ontological categories presupposed by natural 
language and commonsense. The purpose of this 
paper is to provide a comparison of the primitive 
relations defined for BFO and DOLCE. Note that 
BFO uses the terms continuant and occurrent – while 
DOLCE uses endurant and perdurant – to denote 
entities that are wholly present in an instant of time 
and those that have temporal parts, respectively. 
Dependence and Quality 
Specializations of dependence include ‘function of’ 
and ‘role of’, the domain of which are internally and 
externally grounded realizable entities, respectively4. 
This is not the case for ‘quality of’, since qualities 
are not dependent on a process or activity to be 
manifested.  DOLCE deﬁnes ‘quality of’ as a relation 
between a quality, and another quality, endurant, or 
perdurant. As with BFO, a quality cannot be present 
unless the particular it inheres in is also present. 
However unlike BFO, in DOLCE this relation can 
hold between two qualities, or between qualities and 
occurrents.  BFO observes that describing qualities as 
inhering in events is convenient for explanation, but 
represents knowledge and not ontological reality. 
DOLCE also includes a relation ‘quale of’ holding 
between qualities and qualia, the latter of which only 
exists as a reflection of human cognition. 
Constitution 
Constitution is a more general sense of composition – 
which denotes ‘is made of’ – and helps describe 
particulars that are naturally in flux5. x constitutes y 
when there are properties of x (e.g., heartbeat) which 
are accidental to x (e.g., body) but essential to y (e.g., 
person)6 . DOLCE includes constitution as a primitive 
relation, but according to BFO two things cannot 
exist at the same time and space. However a relation 
in BFO similar to constitution is ‘role of’. 
Conclusion 
BFO holds that qualities can only inhere in 
continuants, and entities that are only available 
through the human perceptual lens are not bona fide, 
falling to subjectivism. DOLCE applies the notion of 
quality more liberally, and allows for objects of 
thought to be basic units of its ontology. Future work 
should investigate how entities of a conceptualist-
centric upper ontology can fit into the theory and 
hierarchy of a realist one, in a manner that does not 
contradict its philosophical underpinnings.

Multiple Ontologies for Integrating Complex Phenotype Datasets 
Mary Shimoyama, Melinda Dwinell, Howard Jacob 
Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA 
Abstract 
There has been an emergence of multiple large scale 
phenotyping projects in the rat model organism 
community as well as renewed interest in the ongoing 
phenotype 
data 
generated 
by 
thousands 
of 
researchers using hundreds of rat strains worldwide. 
Unfortunately, this data is scattered and is neither 
described nor formatted in a standardized manner. A 
system to integrate complex phenotype data from 
multiple sources and facilitate data mining and 
analysis is being developed using multiple ontologies. 
Introduction 
The potential value of integrating phenotype data 
from multiple sources (different laboratories, varying 
techniques to measure similar phenotypes, multiple 
strains) is enormous. Presented here is a data 
integration system for complex phenotype data from 
both large-scale and individual experiments and the 
taxonomy and ontologies that provide the backbone 
of this format. RGD along with Mouse Genome 
Informatics (MGI) (Blake et al, 2009) and the Animal 
QTL Database (Hu and Reecy, 2007) is developing a 
Vertebrate Trait Ontology to represent morphological 
states and physiological processes to be used to 
annotate quantitative trait loci (QTL) and other data. 
RGD has also used the Mammalian Phenotype 
Ontology (Smith et al, 2005) for several years to 
indicate the relationship of genomic elements to 
abnormal phenotypes. The Vertebrate Trait Ontology 
represents 
what 
is 
being 
assessed, 
and 
the 
Mammalian Phenotype Ontology represents the 
conclusion that was made. The system presented here 
represents what was done to measure the trait in order 
to reach the conclusion. Because of the close 
relationship among these ontologies, care is being 
taken to ensure compatibility and similarity in 
structure using the phenotype properties in the 
Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO) for guidance. 
(http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/PATO:M 
ain_Page) 
Data Format and Ontologies 
Standardization of data types and relationships used 
to define the phenotype experiment and resulting 
data, and the ontologies to be used to standardize 
descriptive fields are being developed. For phenotype 
data, the major informational components include 
Researcher, Study, Experiment, Sample, Experimental 
Conditions and Clinical Measurement. A Rat Strain 
Taxonomy has been developed to standardize this 
information and provide the relationships among 
strains to allow investigators to retrieve and analyze 
phenotype data for strains that are related genetically. 
Two important aspects of a phenotype measurement 
include 1) what was measured and 2) how it was 
measured. The Clinical Measurement Ontology and 
the Measurement Method Ontology are being 
developed to standardize this information. In addition 
an Experimental Conditions ontology is under 
construction to allow integration of data measured 
under various conditions. 
Pilot Study Results 
Cardiovascular and biochemistry phenotype data 
from two major datasets have been integrated using 
the Rat Strain Taxonomy and the three phenotype 
related ontologies. A prototype data mining tool 
http://rgd.mcw.edu/rgdweb/ has also been developed 
that provides the user with options to begin a search 
with strains or any of the ontologies and make 
subsequent filter choices from the other ontologies. 
Choices presented to the user are restricted to those 
for which data is available and query tracking 
functions are provided to alert the user to the number 
of results being returned and the query choices made.

Modeling Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Rate Using BFO and DOLCE 
Lynda Temal, Arnaud Rosier, Olivier Dameron, Anita Burgun 
U936 INSERM University of Rennes 1, IFR140, Rennes, France 
Abstract 
This paper presents an application ontology for 
modeling cardiac rhythm and its anomalies such as 
tachycardia and bradycardia. We use BFO and 
DOLCE as ontological reference framework in order 
to compare their impact on ontology design.  
Introduction 
Managing cardiac rhythm disorders usually involves 
implanted cardiac devices (artificial pacemakers 
and/or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators) to treat 
arrhythmias (bradycardias or tachycardias). Such 
devices send many remote alerts about arrhythmias to 
physicians, who have to assess their relevance and 
emergency level. In the AKENATON project, we 
aim at improving alert management by shifting from 
strictly device-centered follow-up to perspectives 
centered on the patient. This requires reasoning 
capabilities relying on domain knowledge. We 
designed an application ontology based on the 
following principles: i) the ontology has an 
applicative purpose and will be used to reason on real 
data. ii) we used a foundational ontology as a 
reference 
framework 
to 
guarantee 
ontological 
commitment, competency, and reasoning capabilities. 
We model cardiac rhythm and heart rate, and 
compare the implications of using BFO1 and 
DOLCE2 as upper-level ontologies. 
Results: Use Case and Ontology Design 
Patients may present different types of arrhythmia 
whose caracterization refers to the cardiac frequency 
(heart rate may be fast or slow) during the 
arrhythmia episode.  
Atrial fibrillation is usually irregular and its 
mean frequency is referred to as arrhythmia heart 
rate. Ventricular tachycardia is typically regular 
although it may present faster or  slower parts during 
the same episode. The fastest frequency is then 
referred to as the episode frequency. Knowledge 
about Arrhythmia and its inherent Heart rate together 
with other clinical information are necessary to 
assess the associated risk level. Since frequency is an 
important piece of information in both cases, it is 
important to model it correctly in our ontology. This 
work focuses on representing the taxonomical 
positions 
and 
the 
relations 
involving 
Heart, 
Arrhythmia and Heart rate. We compared how BFO 
(Figure 1) and DOLCE (Figure 2) influenced the 
ontology design, and studied to what extent both met 
our application requirements. 
Figure 1. Cardiac rhythm and heart rate in BFO 
Figure 2. Cardiac rhythm and heart rate in DOLCE 
Discussion and Conclusion 
According to its realist approach, BFO (Figure 1) 
uses no qualities for Perdurants (i.e. entities that 
unfold in time). Heart rate is therefore not inherent 
in an Arrhythmia. Instead, Heart rate is inherent in 
Heart which participates in such Arrhythmia. Thus, 
determining whether an Arrhythmia is fast or slow 
according to a heart rate is not straightforward from 
BFO. Conversely, DOLCE, because of its cognitive 
bias (Figure 2) recognizes qualities associated with 
Perdurants. Heart rate is inherent in Cardiac rhythm 
which has for participant a heart. Hence, DOLCE 
allows to associate for each kind of arrhythmia the 
appropriate heart rate with the exact semantic of how 
the measure is made. The heart rate of an atrial 
fibrillation is the mean frequency, whereas the heart 
rate of a ventricular tachycardia is the fastest 
frequency of the episode.  Thus, DOLCE is directly 
suitable for characterizing the exact semantic 
associated to the frequency of different kinds of 
cardiac rhythm. This property is used for inferring 
when arrhythmia is fast or slow, which is necessary 
for computing an associated risk level.

NPO: Ontology for Cancer Nanotechnology Research 
Dennis G. Thomas, Rohit V. Pappu, Nathan A. Baker 
Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA 
Abstract 
We present the design and development of 
NanoParticle Ontology (NPO). The ontology is 
implemented in the Ontology Web Language (OWL). 
The domain terms in NPO currently represent 
entities, which describe knowledge about physical, 
chemical, and functional properties of nanoparticles 
characterized in cancer nanotechnology research. 
The upper-level of NPO is formed using terms from 
the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). 
Introduction 
In cancer nanotechnology research, there are diverse 
types of nanoparticles being developed and tested for 
applications in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics 
(NP-CDTs). These nanoparticles are diverse in their 
chemical composition, properties and application. 
The chemical composition of these nanoparticles can 
be varied in many combinatorial ways, which result 
in 
the 
development 
of 
as 
many 
types 
of 
nanoparticles. Small variations in the chemical 
composition cause drastic changes in the physical, 
chemical and functional properties of nanoparticles. 
Experiments performed to characterize the properties 
of these nanoparticles generate large volumes and 
diverse types of data. To efficiently share and use 
this data, and to further the application of 
nanotechnology to cancer treatment, supports for a 
common vocabulary and informatics methods are 
required. 
We have developed an ontology, called the 
NanoParticle Ontology (NPO), to provide a common 
vocabulary and the knowledge framework for 
enabling interdisciplinary discourse, and annotation 
of NP-CDT data in order to facilitate the sharing and 
semantic integration of data for reuse, analysis and 
inferencing of the data.  
Results 
We developed the NPO using well-defined design 
principles in OWL. Public releases of NPO are 
available through BioPortal (http://tinyurl.com/npo­
bioportal). The current version (2009-04-02) of the 
NPO contains 919 terms and 21 associative 
relationships. The domain terms in the NPO were 
first obtained from the literature and other controlled 
vocabularies / ontologies (e.g., GO, ChEBI, NCI 
Thesaurus). These terms were organized into a 
taxonomic hierarchy starting with BFO terms at the 
upper-level of the NPO (see Figure 1). The domain 
terms represent different types of entities related to 
the description of NP-CDTs. These include entities 
which describe: (1) material entities that are 
synthesized, characterized and distinguished at the 
nanoscale (1-100 nm) size range; (2) material entities 
that are distinguished at the molecular structure level; 
(3) physical sites in a material entity; (4) surface of a 
material entity; (5) quality or property inhering in a 
material entity; (6) role of material entity at the 
molecular level; (7) type of stimulus for activating 
nanoparticle function, and response to stimulus; (8) 
tumor targeting methods; (9) functions of molecular 
entities that are realized as processes; (10) biological 
processes; 
and, 
(11) 
chemical 
linkages 
and 
interactions in a nanoparticle.  
Figure 1. Example showing the BFO classification of domain terms 
Conclusion and Future Directions 
We have laid the foundation for future growth of 
NPO. Future work involves curation of existing 
terms and extension of NPO for supporting 
caNanoLab (http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/projects/calab/) 
database curation activities and data annotation.

Abstract 
Querying data and meta-data across clinical trials 
and observational studies is difficult because of the 
lack of semantic and terminology standards for 
describing the design and analysis of human studies. 
The Ontology of Clinical Research (OCRe) is an 
ontology created to fulfill this need. OCRe allows the 
indexing of human studies across multiple study 
designs, interventions/exposures, outcomes, and 
health conditions. With such indexing, investigators 
interested in the evidence pertaining to a particular 
question (e.g., what is the effect of A on B in people 
with C) will be able to locate relevant research 
studies more easily across disparate data sources. 
Human studies – encompassing both interventional 
and observational studies – are the most important 
source of evidence for advancing health science. 
These studies are expensive, logistically complex, 
and labor intensive to design, perform, and analyze. 
Important tasks for clinical and translational research 
include searching for studies that involve particular 
designs, interventions, or outcomes. Such queries are 
currently difficult to execute because there is no 
standard terminology or information model for the 
design of human studies and because clinical terms 
are not standardized across studies. To address these 
difficulties, we created the Ontology of Clinical 
Research (OCRe), a formal OWL ontology that 
represents the entities and relationships related to the 
design and analysis of human studies. 
We conceptualize a study as a real-world entity 
whose properties and components parts evolve during 
the life cycle of the study. At the design stage, the 
artifacts of study consist mostly of documents (i.e., 
informational entities) that spell out the scientific 
hypothesis being studied, the design of the study, and 
planned activities of the study. At the execution 
phase, participants of a study carry out activities that 
result in a body of collected data. In the analysis 
phase, investigators transform the data and perform 
statistical analysis on them, resulting in publications 
and other artifacts. 
The current OCRe ontology focuses on the design 
stage of studies. It is a modular ontology of clinical 
investigation that includes (1) a representation of the 
structure of human studies and associated entities 
(e.g. persons and organizations), (2) informational 
entities, such as study protocols, eligibility criteria, 
the specification of outcome variables and the 
statistical methods used to analyze them, (3) terms 
for characterizing and classifying study designs (e.g., 
how control groups are defined helps to characterized 
a parallel group study), and (4) bindings to standard 
terminologies, such as SNOMED CT and the NCI 
Thesaurus. We reused ontologies and information 
models that have already covered relevant domains. 
For example, the modeling of the schedule of 
activities in OCRe is imported from BRIDG.1 The 
objective of having such a rich model is to permit 
queries across multiple types of studies that cannot 
now be performed.  
OCRe has been subjected to initial formative 
evaluation, in which we annotated published clinical 
studies with OCRe terms and verified that we can 
query the repository of studies to select for studies 
that satisfy specific criteria. This has included cancer 
clinical trials annotated as part of the UK Medical 
Research 
Council 
funded 
CancerGrid 
project 
(http://www.cancergrid.org). Within the US National 
Institutes of Health CTSA Human Studies Database 
Project, it will be evaluated and further developed as 
a key component of a federated multi-centre database 
of human studies.

A Collaborative Framework for Ontology Development 
Tania Tudorache, Natasha Noy, Mark A. Musen 
Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford, CA, USA 
Abstract 
We present a collaborative platform for editing and 
browsing ontologies in distributed environments that 
provide facilities for discussions, change tracking, 
provenance, policy control, simultaneous editing and 
querying. The platform can be accessed by 
Collaborative Protégé – an extension of the Protégé 
tool that provides rich support for editing, and by 
WebProtégé – a lightweight web-based version of the 
ontology editor that is implemented as a web portal. 
All software is open-source and available at: 
http://protege.stanford.edu. 
The Collaborative Framework 
As ontologies become more prevalent in many 
domains, such as bio-medicine, they evolve as 
dynamic products of collaborative development 
rather 
than 
artifacts 
produced 
in 
a 
closed 
environment of a single research group. In this 
poster, we will present a collaboration framework 
that our group has developed to support the 
collaborative ontology development. In designing the 
framework, we have been inspired by the popularity 
of Web 2.0 applications and have borrowed some of 
their most popular features as we describe in the 
following paragraphs. A user may access the 
framework 
through 
a 
desktop 
client, 
called 
Collaborative 
Protégé, 
through 
a 
web-client, 
WebProtégé, or from other applications. 
The collaborative framework provides several 
collaboration functionalities that are exposed in the 
two clients, and that can be invoked by any other 
application using the Java API. Some of the main 
features are: support for simultaneous editing of 
ontologies, policy control (read, write, etc.), change 
tracking and provenance information (who did what 
and when), attaching different types of notes to 
entities in the ontology, live chat, integrated search 
on other terminologies and ontologies to support 
mappings, etc. Additional features that are already 
available in Protégé can also be accessed by the 
collaboration 
framework, 
such 
as 
structured 
comparison of different versions of an ontology, 
mappings, visualization, reasoning, and many others. 
The collaborative framework is pluggable and new 
functionalities can be added very easily. Two users 
working simultaneously in Collaborative Protégé and 
WebProtégé will see immediately each other changes. 
Collaborative Protégé 
We have developed Collaborative Protégé1 as one of 
the 
clients 
of 
the 
Collaborative 
Framework. 
Collaborative Protégé enables users who develop an 
ontology collaboratively to hold discussions, chat, 
annotate ontology components and changes – all as 
an integral part of the ontology development process.  
Users are able to attach notes to ontology parts (e.g., 
“ToDo: check class synonyms for class Disease”). 
Privileged users may assign tasks to other users, or 
may start change proposals (e.g., “Adjust definition of 
this class”) to which other users may express their 
agreement 
or 
disagreement 
by 
voting. 
The 
framework tracks all the changes made in the 
ontology, so that a full history of an ontology 
component (e.g., a class) is available together with 
the provenance information. Search and filtering of 
all notes and other annotation types are also available 
through the user interface. Our collaborators have 
also found the integrated chat functionality to be very 
useful when they needed to send short message with 
internal links to ontology parts.  
WebProtégé 
An alternative client of the Collaborative Framework 
is WebProtégé2 – an open source lightweight 
ontology editor for the Web that supports the 
collaborative development process. In designing the 
user interface, we took inspiration from well known 
portals, such as MyYahoo and iGoogle. We refer to 
each component in the user interface as a portlet 
(e.g., Class tree portlet, Notes portlet). Users can 
easily customize the appearance of the interface 
using drag-n-drop. Users can also show or hide 
specific tabs, or add other portlets to a tab via toolbar 
buttons. In this way, a project can customize the user 
interface of WebProtégé in a straightforward way 
based on different criteria (user's expertise, role, etc.). 
In a similar way to Collaborative Protégé, users may 
add notes to ontology parts. All edits in the web 
client 
are 
tracked 
together 
with 
provenance 
information.

A Linguistic Approach to Aligning Representations 
of Human Anatomy and Radiology 
Pinar Wennerberg1, Manuel Möller2, Sonja Zillner1 
1Siemens AG, Munich, Germany; 2DFKI, Kaiserslautern, Germany 
Abstract 
To realize applications such as semantic medical image 
search different domain ontologies are necessary that 
provide complementary knowledge about human 
anatomy and radiology. Consequently, integration of 
these different but nevertheless related types of 
medical knowledge from disparate domain ontologies 
becomes necessary. Ontology alignment is one way 
to achieve this objective. Our approach for aligning 
medical ontologies has three aspects: (a) linguistic-
based, (b) corpus-based, and (c) dialogue-based. We 
briefly report on the linguistic alignment (i.e. the first 
aspect) using an ontology on human anatomy and a 
terminology on radiology.  
Linguistic-based Medical Ontology Alignment 
Semantic medical image search as approached by 
MEDICO1 research project relies on ontology based 
semantic annotation of the image contents and patient 
data for an efficient search. Retrieving heterogeneous 
information (i.e. images and text) from a single 
access point requires the data to have been previously 
integrated appropriately. The integration task can be 
addressed by aligning the ontologies (i.e. ontology 
matching2 or alignment.) that are used for the 
annotation e.g. Foundational Model of Anatomy 
(FMA) and Radiology Lexicon (RadLex). Our 
ontology alignment approach3 has 3 aspects: (a) the 
linguistic analysis, (b) corpus analysis and (c) user 
interaction. The linguistic aspect suggests exploiting 
the information rich concept labels in the medical 
ontologies to discover further relations. The context 
information aspect based on corpus analysis assumes 
that ontology concepts from different ontologies with 
similar meaning will have similar contexts in the 
corpus so that the concept similarity follows from the 
context similarity. Finally, the user interaction aspect 
conceives of an alignment process as an interactive 
dialogue between the user and the system.  
The linguistic alignment proposes to use rules for 
detecting the syntactic variants of the ontology 
concept labels to discover semantic relations e.g., 
equivalence and hyperonymy. In this way the initial 
ontologies are augmented with new concepts to be 
aligned subsequently. For example, the concept label 
‘blood in aorta’ (noun preposition noun) can be 
transformed to ‘aorta blood’ using the rule: [noun1 
preposition:in noun2 Æ noun2 noun1]. We annotated 
both FMA and RadLex concept labels with part-of­
speech (POS) information i.e. we assigned the words 
their lexical categories. Eventually, for the most 
frequent prepositions (e.g. in, of, to) we generated 
924 FMA and 135 RadLex variants (i.e. semantic 
equivalents) using the previous rule. Initial matching 
was exact string match between the concept labels of 
FMA 
and 
RadLex, 
which 
yielded 
1147 
correspondences. Additional 62 were found using the 
generated variants. We also generated hyperonyms 
(superconcepts) 
as 
additional 
concepts 
for 
subsequent matching. For all the multi-word concept 
labels from FMA and RadLex, where the last noun in 
the concept label is preceded by at least one or more 
successive 
adjectives, 
an 
adjective 
from 
the 
beginning of the multi-word concept label was 
omitted 
repeatedly 
until 
one 
adjective+noun 
combination was left. Each newly generated concept 
label in this way was added to the original as its 
hyperonym and used for matching. Eventually, we 
generated for FMA 1504 and for RadLex 902 
hyperonyms that we incorporated in the alignment 
process. Currently, we are at the process of evaluating 
the validity of the semi-automatically generated variants 
with our clinical expert. Next step will be the 
implementation of the context-based alignment aspect.

Abstract 
BioPortal (http://bioportal.bioontology.org) is an 
open repository of biomedical ontologies that 
provides programmatic and web-based access to 
ontologies developed in OBO, OWL, Protégé frames, 
and RDF. Features include browsing, searching, and 
visualization of ontologies. Searching of integrated 
data resources is also possible through ontology-
based indexing of biomedical resources with 
BioPortal ontologies. 
Introduction 
A variety of ontology repositories exist, however they 
differ by either method of ontology content collection 
or ontology formats supported.1-6 BioPortal is an 
open repository of biomedical ontologies that store 
ontologies developed in various formats, that 
provides for automatic updates by user submissions 
of new versions, and that provides access via Web 
browsers and through Web services. 
BioPortal Content and Functionality 
The ontology content of BioPortal covers a wide 
range of subject matter such as anatomy, phenotype, 
imaging, chemistry, and experimental conditions. 
BioPortal supports ontologies in OBO, OWL, 
Protégé frames, and RDF. Metadata collected for 
each 
ontology 
include 
keywords, 
version 
information, release date, and ontology author 
contact information. BioPortal also supports filters of 
the ontology content such as limiting the view to 
OBO Foundry ontologies.7 
BioPortal users can browse and search the ontologies, 
submit new versions of the ontologies in the 
repository, comment on any ontology (or portion of 
an ontology) in the repository, add a review of the 
ontology, describe their experience in using the 
ontology, 
or 
make 
suggestions 
to 
ontology 
developers. The focus on enabling members of the 
community to contribute actively to BioPortal 
content and to increase the value of that content to 
other users distinguishes BioPortal from other 
ontology repositories. Another key feature of 
BioPortal is the ability to query biomedical data 
resources such as ArrayExpress, the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO), and ClinicalTrials.gov through the 
annotation and indexing of these resources with 
ontologies in BioPortal.8,9 
Conclusion 
BioPortal not only provides investigators, clinicians, 
and 
developers 
“one-stop 
shopping” 
to 
programmatically access biomedical ontologies, but 
also integrates data from various biomedical 
resources.

Improvement of PubMed Literature Searching Using Biomedical Ontology 
Zuoshuang Xiang, Yongqun He  
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA  
Abstract 
PubMed articles are annotated using the Medical 
Subject Headings (MeSH) to increase search 
efficiency. 
However, 
MeSH 
contains 
limited 
information on many biomedical domains (e.g., 
vaccines). Biomedical ontologies may be used to 
improve PubMed searching capability. This study 
demonstrates that Vaccine Ontology (VO) can be 
used to significantly improve PubMed searching 
efficacy in the vaccine domain. The recall and 
precision of the ontology-based literature mining 
approach are analyzed and discussed.  
Introduction 
MeSH is the controlled vocabulary of medical and 
scientific terms that are used by biomedical scientists 
to manually index articles in the PubMed literature 
database. The MeSH terminology has been used in 
PubMed to improve literature searching. However, 
MeSH does not cover many biomedical domains 
(e.g., vaccine) well. An ontology represents the 
consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and 
relations which are logically formulated to promote 
intelligent information retrieval and modeling. We 
hypothesize that ontology-based PubMed search will 
significantly improve literature search efficacy. To 
test this hypothesis, we apply the Vaccine Ontology 
(VO; http://www.violinet.org/vaccineontology) to search 
for PubMed literature associated with Brucella 
vaccines. Brucella is an intracellular bacterium that 
causes brucellosis, the most common zoonotic 
disease worldwide. 
Results 
A user case study is to search “live attenuated 
Brucella vaccine” in PubMed. As of June 10, 2009, a 
direct PubMed search of this string of keywords 
returns 58 papers (or PubMed hits). VO includes 16 
Brucella vaccines (including 4 licensed vaccines) that 
have phenotypes of ‘live’ and ‘attenuated’. We 
developed an algorithm that recursively searches for 
all ontology labels and synonyms of the class 
‘Brucella vaccine’ and all its subclasses in VO. The 
phenotypes ‘viable’ (synonym: live) and ‘attenuated’ 
are used for filtering out unqualified Brucella 
vaccines. All names are assembled into a searching 
string for a PubMed keywords search. VO is designed 
based on OBO Foundry principles. Each subclass in 
VO has an ‘is_a’ relationship with its parent class. 
This ensures that all subclasses (e.g., Brucella RB51) 
can be included when a parent class (e.g., “Brucella 
vaccine”) is searched.

Our search using this VO-based method significantly 
increased the recall of searching “live attenuated 
Brucella vaccine” by 13 fold (698/55) compared to 
the searching without VO (Table 1). The precision of 
the searching remains high (91% vs 95%). Using 
“strain 19” or “strain 2” instead of (strain 19) or 
(strain 2) dramatically improves precision to >95% 
(not implemented in Table 1). Our study shows that 
inclusion of synonyms (e.g., strain 19 vs. S19) can 
improve searching recall. However increased recall 
and precision can only be achieved with well-
assigned names for labels and synonyms. For 
example, the search for the term ‘Brucella abortus 
bacA mutant vaccine’ returns higher searching 
precision than ‘Brucella abortus bacA mutant’ 
without lose of recall. On the other hand, “Brucella 
RB51” is better than “Brucella abortus RB51” for 
obtaining higher recall without lose of precision. This 
approach was also successfully applied to other types 
of Brucella vaccines and vaccines against other 
pathogens. A web server (http://www.violinet.org/pubvo) 
is currently under development using our ontology-
based literature mining method. 
Conclusion and Discussion 
Bio-ontologies (e.g., VO) can be used to improve 
literature searching. Ontology term naming is 
important for improved literature search.

CORRECTED VERSION  
Logical Implications for Regulatory Relations  
Represented by Verbs in Biomedical Texts   
Sine Zambach  
Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark  
Abstract 
Relations used in biomedical ontologies can be very 
general or very specific in respect to the domain. 
However some relations are used widely in for 
example regulatory networks. This work focuses on 
positive and negative regulatory relations, in 
particular their usage expressed as verbs in different 
biomedical genres and the properties of the relations.  
Introduction 
In the research area of biomedical ontologies, the 
work with formal relations has recently reached a 
level where integration in a larger project is 
possible1. Using a thorough analysis of the actual 
logic implications of the relations has been 
suggested2. 
With the opportunity of using new DL-formalism 
EL+ and reasoning tool3, CEL, relations can be 
treated 
as 
modules 
with 
complex 
inclusions 
themselves. 
This study is concerned with the two relations, 
positive and negative regulation relations. The 
relations have been investigated in corpora and in 
relation to their logical implications. For an easy 
reading we call them stimulates and inhibits. 
Results 
Inhibit and stimulate are relations that – in a 
biochemical pathway actually contains a special kind 
of inheritance, e.g. if x inhibits y and y stimulates z, 
then you can deduce that x stimulates z as formulated 
in FOL using stim for stimulation and inh for 
inhibition: 
∀x(A x →∀y B y ∧ 
( )  stim y,z →
)
( )  
( ( )  stim(x, y)∧∀z(C z ∧ 
(
)  stim(x,z) ) 
∀x(A x →∀y B y ∧
( )  
)
( )  
( ( )  inh(x, y)∧∀z(C z ∧inh(
)  
y,z →stim(x,z )) 
( )  
( ( )  inh(x, y)∧∀( 
∧ 
(
)  inh(x,z) )
→∀y B y ∧ 
( )  stim y,z →
)
∀x(A x 
z C z 
∀x(A x →∀y B y ∧ 
( )  inh y,z →
)
( )  
( ( )  stim(x, y)∧∀z(C z ∧
(
)  inh(x,z) ) 
These properties can also be expressed in the EL+ 
language and are called complex role inclusions3: 
inhibit o stimulate ⊆ inhibit etc and the new CEL-
module can handle axioms like this. 
The verb frequencies in biomedical corpora are 
ranked in figure 1. This experiment reveals that verbs 
representing the regulatory relations has a special use 
in for example Medline abstracts and biomedical 
patents compared to the British National Corpus 
(BNC). Whereas the 10 most frequent verbs from 
BNC has a low rank in all corpora, the regulatory 
relations seems to be more specific for the 
biomedical texts. 
Conclusion 
Corpora 
analysis 
indicates 
that 
the 
words 
representing positive and negative processes have an 
important role in biomedical texts which should be 
investigated 
further. In addition to this, an 
implementation in DL is suggested such that these 
relations can be expressed in a way that facilitates 
e.g. reasoning.  Files can be found at:

Annotation-Based Meta-Analysis of Microarray Experiments  
Jie Zheng, Junmin Liu, Elisabetta Manduchi, Christian J. Stoeckert, Jr.

Abstract 
We are developing software applications to perform 
meta-analysis of microarray experiments based on 
standardized experiment annotations aiming to 
identify similar experiments and cluster experiments. 
The applications were tested on files obtained from 
the ArrayExpress public repository. Annotation terms 
were used to compute experiment dissimilarities to 
find experiments related to a query experiment. These 
applications may motivate efforts of bench biologists 
to better annotate experiments. 
Introduction and Methods 
Integrating data to address a scientific problem of 
interest is a major challenge. Meta-analysis of 
experiments based on standard annotations to identify 
similar 
experiments 
will 
facilitate 
such 
data 
integration. Standardized microarray experiment 
annotations can be generated using the MGED 
ontology (MO)1. We are developing software 
applications to extract the annotation components 
covering the biological intent and context of 
experiments and then generate dissimilarity measures 
between experiments to find related experiments. 
Annotated 
experiments 
were 
obtained 
from 
ArrayExpress2 in the MAGE-TAB format3 and used 
to test the applications. 
Annotation Components Used:  
•  StudyName (free-text) 
•  ExperimentDesignType (MO terms) 
•  ExperimentFactorType (MO terms) 
•  ExperimentFactorValue (free-text or measurement 
or ontology terms) 
•  Organism (ontology terms) 
•  BiomaterialCharacteristics (ontology terms) 
•  TreatmentType (MO terms) 
Proposed Dissimilarity Measures: The dissimilarity 
between two experiments was computed based on the 
overlap of the two corresponding annotation term 
sets for each annotation component and weighted 
averaging across components. 
Gold Standards for Experiments: A list of gold 
standards for experiments about glucose responsive 
genes and insulin secretion in islets was obtained 
based on keyword searches of ArrayExpress. Three 
experiments in this list were used as query 
experiments to find related experiments obtained 
from a total of 6632 experiments. The remaining 
experiments from the same list were used as positive 
controls. A list of negative controls was compiled too. 
Results 
The first software module to retrieve annotations 
from MAGE-ML or MAGE-TAB files has been 
developed. A second software module has been built 
to generate dissimilarity measures between a query 
experiment and a collection of target experiments, 
based on the extracted annotation terms. We tried 
various 
combinations 
of 
0-1 
weights 
to 
include/exclude annotation components to optimize 
the scores between the positive (resp. negative) 
controls and the query experiments. 
The query experiment with the richest annotations led 
to the best results in finding closely related 
experiments in ArrayExpress when the free-text 
annotation 
fields 
(StudyName 
and 
ExperimentFactorValue) were not included. Including 
these fields improved the ability to distinguish true 
positive and true negative experiments using the two 
query experiments with fewer annotations. This 
indicates that the free-text fields provide extra 
information for experiments with fewer standardized 
annotations. Including all annotation components 
except for Organism and TreatmentType gave good 
results. However, this does not mean that these should 
be the weights of choice for all possible applications. 
Conclusion and Future Work 
1.  Meta-analyses based on annotation can help to 
find closely related experiments. The more richly 
annotated query experiment gave better results in 
identifying similar experiments from our test set. 
2.  A suitable weight assigned to each annotation 
component 
can 
improve 
the 
dissimilarity 
measures. 
3.  To further improve the comparison of annotation 
terms, we will harmonize terms using meta­
thesauri, tag controlled terms from free-text 
annotations, and apply ontological relationships 
to refine the dissimilarity measures.
