Preface
The idea for this book came from a class that I taught at Indiana University in the
years 2005–2008. The class, ‘‘Viruses and human history: the effect of viruses on
human society,’’ was intended for freshman non-biology majors, and fulﬁlled a
science requirement. Michael Oldstone’s Viruses, Plagues and History was the
assigned text. Although I considered this an excellent text, some students
(speciﬁcally those with no science background) found it difﬁcult and too detailed.
I initially introduced material on molecular biology, including nucleic acid
structure and protein structure as simply as I could in class, but since a proportion
of the students were from the business or music school, this, too, proved too
difﬁcult. In addition, many students had no chemistry background. I therefore
taught the course with minimal references to Molecular biology and chemistry—a
difﬁcult task for someone who had taught both graduate and undergraduate courses
to virology majors for many years. I have used the same approach in this book—a
minimal amount of chemistry—but I do describe viral structure and viral cell
interaction.
I had originally thought of dividing the book into three segments: past, present
and future. The ‘‘future’’ would not be predictions of new epidemics, rather the use
of viruses as tools to cure disease, viral vectors carrying genes to cure genetic
diseases, viral treatment of tumors (viral oncolysis), and phage therapy against
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However the ‘‘past’’ and ‘‘present’’ are difﬁcult to
separate. What is past in the USA and the Western World is unfortunately present
in the Third World. The development of vaccines has eliminated most common
childhood diseases in ‘‘our world,’’ but there are still millions dying from these
diseases in Africa and parts of Asia. We have conquered smallpox, and almost
wiped out polio, but millions are still dying from diseases such as measles, hep-
atitis A, hepatitis B and other viruses in the rest of the world.
In the course of my research for this book, I was struck by the effect of
infectious disease on armies and military campaigns. This should not have come as
a surprise, since in the military, the conditions are such that hundreds of thousands
of men live together, in crowded barracks with little sanitation. Not only did
smallpox interfere with military campaigns during the American War of
vii

Independence and the American Civil War, but other diseases—measles, yellow
fever, and hepatitis A (jaundice)—affected the military during World War II. One
historian claims that jaundice forced the U.S. to alter its plans for D-Day. The great
inﬂuenza epidemic of 1918 spread due to the proximity of soldiers to each other in
the trenches, and, as pointed out by Sir Martin Gilbert, by the celebrations that
accompanied the victory at the end of the war see http://virus.stanford.edu/uda/
and Martin Gilbert.
The introductory chapter covers the development of the germ theory and history
of infectious disease until the early 1900s. Viruses were elusive, unseen and
‘‘imaginary’’ entities. Chapters on the history of virology follow it in more detail,
as do the development of cell culture (without which modern virology would not
exist), the discovery of bacteriophage, and the immense contribution such
organisms made to molecular biology. There is also a brief history of immunology.
This last chapter was one of the hardest to write, since modern immunology is
unbelievably complex, and in order to understand it one needs knowledge of cell
biology, signaling mechanism, the functions of various types of cells, biochem-
istry, etc. I have concentrated on the early history of the events leading to clonal
selection of antibodies by going back to the original literature. Discussed, albeit
brieﬂy, are the roles of each of the immune cell types, as they are known today. It
is possible that within 2 or 3 years additional immune cells and cytokines will be
discovered by immunologists. Although interferon is now considered to be one of
many cytokines produced by the body as a component of the immune system, it
has played a prominent role in the history of virology and the direction that viral
research has taken. Interferon biology was an area of research that I have been
active in for some 25 years; once predicted as a ‘‘cure’’ for virus infections, this
expectation unfortunately has not been realized.
Likewise, viruses, for a considerable time during my own career, were thought
to be the causative agent of most cancers. Extensive research was done connecting
cancer and viruses, and many Nobel Prizes were awarded for this work. However,
although most viruses are not directly connected, the oncogene theory and
mutational basis of cancer arose from this research. For this reason, I have
included a chapter on viruses and cancer, and of course there are viruses that do
cause cancer, such as Epstein-Barr, hepatitis B and C, retroviruses and papil-
loma—all of which are discussed in separate chapters.
Continuing sequentially, I have described in some detail the history of smallpox
epidemics and its impact on society; the story of yellow fever and its profound
effect on American history; polio—a disease of the afﬂuent as well as the poor;
herpes viruses and hepatitis viruses, both of which are modern-day scourges; and
the great inﬂuenza epidemic with the amazing story of how this virus was
reconstructed after 75 years.
I have attempted to bring the HIV and AIDS story up to date and present the
current situation. Much of it is troubling, with society biases, problems with blood
supplies, and denial by scientists as well as government bodies of the connection
between HIV and AIDS—and the personal arguments over the discovery of HIV.

Preface

However, there is a bright side to the AIDS story, in that thanks to modern-day
medications, although expensive, AIDS is no longer a fatal disease.
Under emerging viruses, I discuss those viruses that are relatively new to man.
They are not ‘‘new’’ viruses appearing out of nowhere; rather, they are viruses of
other animals—usually bats—that accidentally infect man. They are only new in
the sense that man has become an accidental victim and host by encroaching on
new territory and, in some cases, altering the environment.
It is impossible in a text of this kind to cover all the classes of viruses. I have
selected those viruses where there is an interesting story attached to their discovery
or vaccine development, with all of them having caused immense suffering at one
time. I have also conﬁned myself to viruses that attack man, and not other ver-
tebrates, ﬁsh, or plants. I have included bacterial viruses, since their discovery led
to the molecular biology revolution.
One of the most successful chapters in human history has been the development
of vaccines against most childhood illnesses. New vaccines are being introduced
and licensed in the U.S. and subsequently in the rest of the world at a surprisingly
high pace. In my own lifetime, vaccines have been introduced for all the childhood
illnesses I was aware of while growing up: measles, chickenpox, mumps,
whooping cough, and diphtheria, to list just a few. Within the last few years,
vaccines have been developed against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and papilloma
viruses. With the advent of commercially available, cheap nucleic acid synthesis
and sequencing and the technological know-how of synthesizing a virus in vitro, it
should be possible to develop vaccines, either killed or attenuated against most
viral infections.
As to the future, viruses are now being clinically tested in the U.S., U.K., and
China as tools against deadly cancers. Brain tumors are among the most untreat-
able cancers, and a positive diagnosis of such is a death sentence. Today, ade-
novirus and herpesvirus vectors are being used as a mode of treatment in China
and are being tested elsewhere. Viral treatment does not have the side effects found
with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and initial results look promising. I have
delved into the background of viral oncolysis, an old idea that is now at the
forefront of research. Another old idea being revisited is that of phage therapy,
selecting bacteriophage to target speciﬁc antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, or
using bacteriophage in the food industry to destroy salmonella contaminants. The
history of d’Herelle and phage therapy is a fascinating one, and has been told in
detail in two publications; Summers WC: Felix d’Herelle and the Origins of
Molecular Biology, Yale University Press, 1999, and Hausler T: Viruses versus
Superbugs, Macmillan, 2006. I cover this history only brieﬂy here, and I recom-
mend these texts for more details.
In the future we will see more and more viruses being constructed outside the
cell, either being made in cell-free solutions or by adding DNA to cells in culture.
A dangerous aspect of this research is the alteration of a wide range of viruses,
which is a daring experiment and will lead to publication, but may be hazardous to
the public.
Preface
ix

Finally, I close with a chapter on biological weapons. Again, this is not a new
topic, since man has always looked for the most efﬁcient way to kill other humans.
In the twentieth century this was developed to perfection with the atom bomb, gas
chambers, and the development of tons of smallpox ready to be used in a global
war. Luckily, this last never happened.
In most cases, I have gone to the available primary literature. This book would
have been much more difﬁcult to write had it not been for the Internet and access
to information on Wikipedia, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the
World Health Organization (WHO). All three of these Internet sites have aston-
ishing amounts of information; wherever possible, I checked their facts against
primary sources.
This book is being written in a new era of information technology. In earlier
days, I would have spent my time in the library looking for material among the
stacks. In other times, I would have traveled to museums and repositories to search
for archival material. With the availability of various search engines and access to
downloading from the Indiana University Library, I have been able to write this
book from home. The Indiana University Library has to be commended for easy
access to most journals, and to the ease of obtaining books through interlibrary
loans; even the rarest material is available.
I wish to thank those who spent time reading and reviewing a few chapters; they
include Dr. Maurizio Mirolli, Professor Emeritus of the IU Medical Sciences
program, and my colleague Dr. Pranav Danthi, friends Phyllis Guskin, Laura Kao,
and Luca Peragallo. I would also like to thank all those who gave permission to use
their illustrations, many of which are on the Internet. I also thank my wife, Mimi,
for her patience in spending time at home while I was writing, for putting up with
my occasional frustrations, and for her encouragement to complete the book.
I of course also thank Andrea Schlitzberger of Springer for handling the
manuscript and for her useful suggestions.
I am grateful to those who gave me permission to use their excellent ﬁgures and
photographs of viruses.

Introduction: A Short History
of Virology
Abstract
Viral infections have been recorded unknowingly from the beginning of
recorded history. The ancient Greeks and Romans described plagues of
unknown origin. In general, infections were blamed on sins and punishment,
balances of ‘‘vital humors’’ or on ‘‘miasma,’’ (rotten smells). In the sixteenth
century, Girolamo Fracastoro suggested that infectious agents might spread
disease, as did Agostino Bassi, studying diseases of silkworms. The develop-
ment of the microscope by Hook and Van Leeuwenhoek in the seventeenth
century led to the discovery of a new living world inhabited by very small
creatures. Edward Jenner in England demonstrated that smallpox, a dreaded
disease, could be prevented by inoculation with an organism that caused
pockmarks on cows and dairymaids; this was the beginning of the concept of
vaccination. Louis Pasteur proved that fermentation only occurred in the
presence of air and was due to microorganisms. Pasteur and Pierre Roux, a
colleague, as well as Jacob Henle and Robert Koch, proved that germs caused
bacterial diseases such as anthrax and tuberculosis; Pasteur and Roux developed
a vaccine against rabies by passaging the infectious material through rabbits. By
the end of the nineteenth century it had been established that most infectious
diseases were the result of germs. In parallel with this research, plant scientists
had isolated material that passed through a low pore ﬁlter that was infectious to
tobacco plants. This was called a ‘‘virus,’’ from the Latin for poison. Viruses
were also found to be associated with leukemia and other cancers of chickens.
The twentieth century saw the discovery of bacteriophage, viruses that attack
bacteria, and the use of such bacteriophage to launch studies of molecular
biology, and DNA and RNA structure.

1.1
What Is a Virus?
Although historians identiﬁed pandemic diseases, which spread around the world,
the agents responsible for these were not recognized until the early and mid-
twentieth century. Some of these pandemics, such as the Black Death, were caused
by bacteria, and others by viruses such as smallpox. The word virus comes from
the Latin meaning poison or slimy matter, and entered the English language to
signify infectious disease.
Even today there is discussion as to whether viruses are ‘‘living’’ entities.
Viruses are so small that they are invisible even at high magniﬁcation with a light
microscope. Viruses cannot be grown independently in culture as can bacteria and
other free-living microorganisms; viruses require a living cell for reproduction,
whether animal, bacterial or plant. A virus contains genetic information—DNA or
RNA—yet the statement that a virus is alive is a controversial one. In the 1930s,
Wendell Stanley was able to form crystals in solution of the tobacco mosaic virus,
a feat that had been performed up until then only with pure chemical molecules
inﬁnitesimally smaller than a virus. Viruses form aggregates (clumping) in solu-
tion and bond chemically with each other to form a crystal. Many different viruses
have been crystallized, and their basic shape and composition revealed. Viruses are
at the edge of life, having attributes of inert objects, such as the ability to form
crystals, yet also possessing characteristics associated with life, such as genetic
material and reproduction. One virus can replicate and give rise to millions more,
which is certainly an attribute of life. A virus exists in two stages, one as an inert
chemical with a chemical formula; for example, the chemical formula for polio-
virus is C332,652 H492,388 N98,245 O131,196 P7,501 S2,340 [1]; when the virus
enters a living cell, it becomes an active replicating organism.
Viruses are genetic parasites—that is, they require the protein synthetic
machinery of the host to reproduce. Viruses, as visualized by the electron
microscope, are symmetrical and complicated structures. Modern-day computers
and electron microscopy allow us to produce fantastic pictures of viruses
(Figs. 1.1, 1.2).

Plagues Before the Germ Theory
The concept of ‘‘germs’’—something invisible that can cause illness—is a quite
recent one. The germ theory is in reality a product of the nineteenth century; until
then, disease was thought of as either a divine intervention and punishment, or the
result of ‘‘miasmas’’ (bad air, stench of rotting material), or on the balance of four
vital humors: blood, phlegm, black bile, or yellow bile. The theory of ‘‘in balance
in humors’’ (body ﬂuids) dates back to the ancient Greeks or even earlier.
Currently, some individuals, and even whole societies, believe that AIDS and
other diseases are the result of divine punishment for speciﬁc lifestyles. The idea
of miasmas being responsible for disease lasted until the early nineteenth century.

Plagues Before the Germ Theory
3

In the eighteenth century, the smell of rotting coffee beans was considered the
causative agent by some, as an explanation for the Yellow Fever epidemic in
Philadelphia.
Plagues have been recorded since the beginning of written history. Certainly the
Bible discusses hygienic precautions against leprosy, the isolation of lepers (a kind of
quarantine) and the precautions to be taken against infection by lepers. Two of the
biblical plagues of Egypt may have been bubonic plague (boils), and rinderpest of
cattle, still prevalent in parts of Africa today. The ancient Greeks and Romans
recorded many plagues. Thucydides recounts the great plague that swept through
Athens during the Peloponnesian Wars in 430 B.C.: ‘‘The dead lay unburied, the
temples were full of corpses. Dying wretches weregathered at every fountain, seeking
to relieve their unquenchable thirst.’’ Thucydides writes that the plague began in
Ethiopia,spreadthroughoutEgypt,over thePersianEmpire,andthen reachedAthens.
There are reports of a similar plague in Rome at about the same time. From
Thucydides’s description of the symptoms, it is difﬁcult to discern whether this
was smallpox or measles in a very virulent form or, as has been suggested, some
bacterial infection such as salmonella typhimurium, or Yesinia pestis, the black
death. He describes the onset of fever, sneezing and coughing, with the discharge
of blood and a fetid smell, followed by the appearance of ulcers and small pustules
on the skin. This was followed by diarrhea and death. Thucydides claims that birds
of prey that devoured the bodies also died, and that the disease could spread to
domestic animals. His description of the effect on physicians and others who
nursed the sick is similar to our descriptions today of outbreaks of dreaded diseases
such as hemorrhagic fevers, Ebola and dengue.
Thucydides also writes that those who recovered from the disease were rarely
affected a second time, thus indicating a recognition of immunity. In 542 A.D., the
plague known as the ‘‘Plague of Justinian’’ hit Rome. The description would
suggest that this was the bubonic plague (Black death—Yersinia pestis), a bacterial
disease that periodically swept through Europe in the late Middle Ages and dec-
imated one-third of the population of Europe.
Apart from the bubonic plague, the other great plagues affecting man were
smallpox, and, later on, yellow fever—both of viral origin. With the Europeans’
colonization of the Americas, viral plagues were important in shaping the history
of the continent. Whole populations of native peoples of North and South America
were wiped out by smallpox, and, to a lesser extent, by measles. When Cortes
landed in Mexico in 1519, the population of Mexico was estimated to be between
25–50 million. Fifty years later the population was only 3 million. Most of the
ravages were due to diseases to which Europeans were semi-immune, not the
superior forces of the Spaniards.
The fact that viruses have been afﬂicting humans since the beginning of written
history is indisputable. Pockmarks similar to those of smallpox have been found on
the face of a mummiﬁed Pharaoh recovered from the pyramids of Egypt. Some
drawings on the tombs from the same period indicate wasting of limbs that could be
due to poliovirus. It has been suggested that viral infection of humans occurred as a
result of the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to a settled agricultural society
4

Introduction: A Short History of Virology

with the domestication of other mammalian species and the transfer of viruses from
these animals to humans. The primitive hunter may have been a healthier person than
the settled ‘‘gatherer,’’ since he lived a more isolated life, without any crowding. The
proximity to domesticated animals and groups of people living under one roof
probably resulted in the introduction of new infections to the human population.
Examples of this have occurred with human infections in the last few years, with the
spread of avian ﬂu, SARS, and HIV— all from other animals.
1.3
Development of the Microscope and Germ Theory
The development of a simple light microscope in the mid-seventeenth century
by Robert Hooke (1635–1703) in England and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
(1632–1723) in Holland gave rise to the identiﬁcation of ‘‘animalcules,’’ micro-
organisms of various shapes, such as bacterial bacilli (rods) and cocci (spheres),
and even spirochetes (twisted structures with ﬂagella—tail-like appendages)
reviewed in [2]. Hook described the basic cell, using slices of cork under his crude
microscope. Leeuwenhoek explored the contents of many substances, including
rainwater collected in barrels, ﬂora from the mouth, semen, etc. He described tiny
organisms using his microscopes that could magnify up to 300 times. These
observations opened up a previously invisible world to science and allowed
advances in many areas beyond diseases. An entire invisible world existed but it
did not, however, include viruses, which are too small to be seen even with the best
light microscope (Figs. 1.3, 1.4).
The ﬁrst person to really describe diseases as caused by infectious agents was
an Italian physician, Girolamo Fracastoro (1478–1553) (Fig. 1.5). He was an acute
observer of the plague in Verona and he published many books on syphilis, a new
disease of the time, as well as the basis of its contagion. Not only was he a
physician, he was also a poet. The name ‘‘syphilis’’ is derived from Fracastoro’s
1530 poem in three books, Syphilis sive morbus gallicus (‘‘Syphilis or The French
Disease’’), about a shepherd named Syphilis, who angered the god Apollo and was
thus cursed with this disease. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Fracastoro).
The poem goes on to describe the symptoms of the disease.
A shepherd once (distrust not ancient fame)
Possest these Downs,
and Syphilus his Name;
Some destin’d Head t’attone the Crimes of all,
On Syphilus the dreadful
Lot did fall.
Through what adventures this unknown Disease
So lately did astonisht Europe seize,
Through Asian coasts and
Libyan Cities ran,
And from what Seeds the Malady began,
Took from France his name.
Our Song shall tell: to Naples ﬁrst it came
From France, and justly named.

Introduction: A Short History of Virology

Fracastoro discussed the spread of disease that resulted from touching con-
taminated clothing (fomites) as well as from contact among individuals. He also
discussed how various diseases infected and affected various age groups in a
population and in various ways. Syphilis was later shown to be a bacterial disease
and was called the ‘‘great pox,’’ as opposed to smallpox, the virus disease,
although smallpox was the more deadly of the two [3].
Another pioneer of the germ theory was Agostino Bassi (1773–1856), an Italian
lawyer and later agriculturist. He devoted a large part of his life to studying
muscardine, a disease of the silkworm. Muscardine was an important fungal pest
of the economically important silk industry of Northern Italy. Many farms were
abandoned because of this disease. Bassi concluded from his studies that an
infectious agent that could be transmitted by contact between worms, and also
could be transmitted by contaminated cages or utensils, caused the disease. He
identiﬁed the infectious agent as a fungus, later named Beauvaria bassiana. He is
also credited with rescuing the vitally important silk industry with recommenda-
tions such as the use of disinfectants; separating the rows of feeding caterpillars;
isolating and destroying infected caterpillars; and keeping the silk farms clean. He
used ‘‘semi-sterile’’ techniques to prevent infection. Pasteur and others who came
after him were unaware of his research and made similar, independent discoveries.
Bassi also proposed that human diseases such as syphilis and measles were
transmitted from one person to another by contact. Both Fracastoro and Bassi have
been overlooked in the history of medicine, whereas Pasteur has become a
household name [2].
1.4
Vaccination in the Time of Jenner
Vaccine development began with attempts to prevent smallpox infections using
variolation (extracting pus from smallpox lesions) and rubbing the pus onto the
arm or leg of an uninfected person. Variolation was ﬁrst performed in China and
later in the Middle East in the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries. The practice of
variolation was introduced into England by Lady Mary Montagu, wife of the
British ambassador to Turkey. She had discovered the use of variolation during her
sojourn in Turkey in 1716–1718; variolation was widely practiced, but often
resulted in cases of smallpox, although not as severe as a natural infection.
Dr. Edward Jenner (1749–1823), a practicing physician in Berkeley, England,
had noted, as had others, that milkmaids very rarely contracted smallpox. Instead,
their hands often had sores later shown to be caused by the cowpox virus
(vaccinia) (Fig. 1.6). Jenner had a small laboratory not far from Berkeley Castle in
northern England, where he did experiments.
Jenner was not the ﬁrst to recognize the connection between cowpox and
immunity to smallpox. A number of farmers had previously made this obser-
vation. For example, Benjamin Jesty, a farmer in Dorset (southern England), had
inoculated his wife and children with cowpox material during an outbreak in
1.3
Development of the Microscope and Germ Theory
7

1774 and, I assume, induced immunity in the family. In 1796 Jenner tested his
hypothesis that the pus from the wounds that occurred on the udder of milking
cows contained material that could protect against smallpox by inoculating
James Phipps, the son of his gardener, with pus from a wound on the hand of his
milkmaid, Sarah Nelmes, who had been infected by a virus from a cow named
Blossom. Blossom is probably one of the most famous cows in history, her hide
immortalized in St George’s Hospital Medical School in London. James was
then variolated with the smallpox virus a number of times and had basically no
reaction, showing complete immunity. Jenner then tested vaccination on 23 other
people, none of whom came down with smallpox. He presented his data to the
Royal Society and published his data [4]. His idea of preventing smallpox with a
‘‘vaccine’’ was not easily accepted on religious grounds (‘‘interfering with the
work of God’’); also ridiculed was the use of material from a cow (see cartoon,
Fig. 1.7) (see Chap. 19, Vaccines).
In this cartoon, the British satirist James Gillray drew a caricature of a scene at
the Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital at St Pancras, showing Edward Jenner
administering cowpox vaccine to frightened young women, and cows emerging
from different parts of people’s bodies. The cartoon was inspired by the contro-
versy over inoculating against the dreaded disease—smallpox. The inoculation
agent, cowpox vaccine, was rumored to have the ability to sprout cow-like
appendages. A serene Edward Jenner stands amid the crowd. A boy next to him
holds a container labeled ‘‘VACCINE POCK hot from ye COW’’; papers in the
boy’s pocket are labeled ‘‘Beneﬁts of the Vaccine.’’ The tub on the desk next to
Jenner is labeled ‘‘OPENING MIXTURE,’’ and bottle next to the tub is labeled
‘‘VOMIT.’’ The painting on the wall depicts worshippers of the Golden Calf.
(from Wikipedia).
Around 1800, Dr. J. Clinch, a medical missionary in Newfoundland, began
using Jenner’s vaccine and by the end of 1801 he had vaccinated approximately
700 people. This was probably the ﬁrst vaccination of an entire community
in North America. Jenner died in 1823 as the result of a stroke. The British
government passed the vaccination act in 1840, making variolation illegal and
supplying smallpox vaccine (cowpox) free of charge. In 1853 the vaccination act
Fig. 1.6 Hand with cowpox
(from Jenner, history of
vaccines)

Introduction: A Short History of Virology

was passed, requiring all children to receive smallpox vaccines by the age of
4 months. Later on, the act was changed to allow parents who objected to vac-
cination to appeal. In 1905 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could impose
mandatory vaccination on children.
Smallpox was declared eradicated from the world in 1980, after an intensive
challenge to stamp it out. In fact, eradication really began in 1803 when the
Spanish crown attempted to vaccinate the entire population of the Philippines.
In 1813 the U.S. Congress passed the vaccination act to insure safe vaccines for the
U.S. public. By 1832 the U.S. government had set up a program for the vaccination
of American Indians; known as the Indian Vaccination Act. Unfortunately it did
not eradicate the spread of the virus and was misused to remove Indians to res-
ervations. Thus there was a piecemeal attempt to eradicate the virus in a few areas
of the world, such as India and the East Indies. By 1897 smallpox had been
eradicated from the US and by the beginning of the twentieth century from most of
the industrialized countries of Europe. Despite this, 2,000,000 people died annu-
ally from the disease in the 1950s; therefore, a campaign was launched in 1959 to
completely eradicate the virus from the hemisphere. Although it took longer than
expected, the last cases of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977 [5, 6].
1.5
Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch
The two giants of microbiology who changed the history of medicine and led to
‘‘modern’’ clinical medicine were Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) in Paris, and Robert
Koch (1843–1910) in Berlin. In 1857–1858 Pasteur made the discovery that put to

rest the theory of spontaneous generation of life. He showed that liquids in sealed
containers remained sterile, but that exposure to the air resulted in contaminations
that gave rise to fermentations or growth of bacteria or fungi. He wrote, ‘‘germs of
microscopic organisms abound in the surface of all objects, in the air, and in
water,’’ concluding that these organisms cause fermentation, such as occur in
wine, beer, vinegar etc., and that under sterile conditions with no access to air
these fermentations do not take place.
About the same time, working in Germany, Robert Koch, a country doctor,
described the organism responsible for anthrax, a disease of cattle. He showed that
the bacteria had a life cycle, including a stage of spore formation, a stage not easily
destroyed by heat or other means, which could account for infections occurring at
various periods, and allowed organisms to live in the soil for a long time. Among
other achievements, Koch went on to isolate and describe the organism responsible
for tuberculosis. Koch was inﬂuenced by his mentor, Jacob Henle, who in 1840
proposed that infectious diseases were caused by living organisms and reproduced
outside the infected individual. Earlier, Aloys Pollender, Pierre-Francois Olive
Rayer and Casamir-Joseph Davaine had discovered the anthrax bacterium. Koch
himself set out to prove scientiﬁcally that this bacillus is, in fact, the cause of the
disease. He inoculated mice with homemade slivers of wood containing anthrax
bacilli taken from the spleens of farm animals that had died of the disease, and
found that these mice were susceptible to the disease and died, whereas mice
inoculated at the same time with blood from the spleens of healthy animals did not.
This conﬁrmed the work of others who had shown that the disease could be
transmitted by means of the blood of infected animals. He went on to develop
methods of growing and staining the bacteria, and with a colleague developed the
Petri dish (named after his colleague) that is still used today [7].
Koch also isolated the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis, and from this developed
speciﬁc postulates. To prove the causative role of the bacillus
the bacilli had to be isolated from the body and cultivated in pure culture until devoid
of all adherent products of disease originating from the animal organism; and, ﬁnally,
through transfer of the isolated bacilli to animals, the same clinical picture of tuberculosis
as is obtained empirically by the injection of naturally developed tuberculous material had
to be produced.
Koch or Emile Roux (1853–1933) proposed this simpliﬁcation of his famous
postulates:
An organism must be isolated from the diseased animal.
It must be possible to grow to a pure culture.
It must be possible to re-infect the animal.
It should be possible to re-isolate the organism.
These postulates are still used as the basis for characterizing an infectious
agent, but have to be modiﬁed in that it is important to emphasize that the disease
produced has to be similar to the one from which the material is taken. For
example, in using an animal model system, such as the mouse, the disease pro-
duced may not be identical in that animal to the one produced in humans. It is also
10
1
Introduction: A Short History of Virology

important that the bacteria or virus be found in all cases of the particular disease.
As will be discussed later, in the case of work with yellow fever, bacteria were
isolated from most yellow fever victims (not all, however) and was claimed to be
the source of the disease. Only by showing that it was not present in ALL patients
could it be proven that it was not the causative agent. It has proven ethically
difﬁcult to carry out Koch’s postulates in the case of some viral diseases that only
infect humans (e.g., human immunodeﬁciency virus [HIV] and hepatitis C). If no
animal model is present, it is difﬁcult to prove beyond a doubt—without human
experimentation—that a speciﬁc agent is the cause of the disease. Smallpox and
measles viruses also are exclusively human pathogens, and the early study of
smallpox in particular involved unregulated research on human subjects. In more
recent times, and particularly in the era of laboratory-driven investigations, we
have had to create very speciﬁc ethical guidelines. Many of the discoveries, such
as the role of mosquitoes in transmitting yellow fever, and vaccination against
smallpox, involved the use of humans in a manner not acceptable today.
In 1878, in a paper read before the French Academy of Sciences, Pasteur
presented evidence that disease was caused by discrete germs. He demonstrated
this for the anthrax bacterium (Bacillus anthrax) isolated as described above by
Koch. Furthermore, he showed that minimal numbers of the bacteria are required
by serial dilution, growing the new cultures in test tubes and injecting material into
animals (see Koch’s postulates above). Anthrax today is better known as a possible
agent of biological warfare than as a disease of cattle. In 2001, envelopes con-
taining anthrax were sent through the U.S. mail to congressmen and caused quite a
panic. It was initially assumed that this was a case of bio-terrorism conducted by
foreign terrorists, although now it is suspected that this was the work of a disturbed
American scientist.
Pasteur also successfully isolated organisms involved in sepsis, which results in
septic shock due to the growth of bacteria and resulting toxins in the blood. During
this study he demonstrated differences between anaerobic and aerobic organisms
and identiﬁed bacterial spores that could give rise to septicemia (blood poisoning).
Such spores survive for a long time outside the body. Koch had made a similar
ﬁnding—that anthrax could exist in a spore form resistant to heat and desiccation.
In a paper in 1880, Pasteur described the application of his ﬁndings and techniques
to other conditions, particularly furuncles (boils). He showed that the pus that
developed from such lesions contained infectious chains made of round cells
(cocci) and that this organism could also be grown in culture. He showed that
every furuncle contained cocci that caused the inﬂammation and pus formation.
These organisms were injected into rabbits and formed abscesses containing pus,
and the same organism could be isolated again (Koch’s postulate). Of great interest
were his observations on puerperal fever, associated with women who had recently
given birth or had a miscarriage, and which was extremely fatal, and the isolation
of the bacteria that caused this disease [8] (Figs. 1.8, 1.9).
Ignaz Semmelweis (1818–1865) (Fig. 1.10), working independently in Vienna,
had shown that puerperal fever could be prevented by handwashing in a chlorine-
lime solution and that it was often spread by physicians after autopsy, or following
1.5
Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch
11

treatment of sick women. Semmelweis was ridiculed for suggesting that doctors,
midwives or nurses spread it. Handwashing was not a common practice, and
Semmelweis insulted the egos of the medical profession by accusing them of
spreading the bacteria. His ideas were accepted only after his death, which
occurred in an asylum at the age of 47. Only a few weeks after being conﬁned to
the asylum, his guards beat him to death. [8, 9].
It could be shown that the organism causing puerperal fever could be grown in
rabbits. In his paper of 1880, Pasteur also proposed the use of antiseptics to kill the
infecting organisms. He proposed the use of boric acid rather than the carbolic acid
then in use. Boric acid was used in the treatment of urinary tract infections by
injection into the bladder. He also proposed placing a pad soaked in boric acid at
the bedside of each woman during conﬁnement to prevent puerperal fever. This
infection was shown to be caused by streptococci and today is treatable with
antibiotics (Fig. 1.10).

1.6
How Can We Differentiate a Virus from a Bacterium?
The differentiation of viruses from other types of disease-causing organisms was
initially based on size and ﬁlterability. Viruses are 100–1,000 times smaller than
bacteria, and this could be determined only when one began to ﬁlter cultures from
infected individuals, plants or animals. Various types of ﬁlters were invented in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to purify water and other liquids. These
early ﬁlters were made of diatomaceous earth from organisms that left a glass shell
after they died, and small matter would pass through the ﬁlters, but larger
organisms, such as most bacteria, fungi, etc., would be retained by the ﬁlter. Thus
viruses could be deﬁned as ‘‘ﬁlterable agents.’’ These porcelain ﬁlters were
developed in the Pasteur group by one of Pasteur’s colleagues, Charles Cham-
berland (1858–1901), and were called ‘‘Chamberland ﬁlters.’’
However, it was difﬁcult to differentiate ‘‘viruses’’ from toxins. Work in the lab
of Louis Pasteur, performed by his colleagues Emile Roux and Alexander Yersin
(1863–1943), identiﬁed the toxin that caused diphtheria. Roux and Yersin devel-
oped an anti-serum to this toxin, which was used to save the lives of many young
adults affected by diphtheria, a fatal disease. Filtration was an important tool in
differentiating bacteria that had been retained by the ﬁlters from toxins and what
were later called viruses. Diphtheria toxin is actually produced by a strain of
bacillus containing a bacteriophage (virus). The toxin is produced by the virus.
Until very recently, the concept of a virus being a ﬁlterable agent, and much
smaller than bacteria, was an accepted dogma of virology. However, within the
last few years, viruses that parasitize protozoa and other lower forms of life have
been isolated; they are as large as bacteria and contain considerable genetic
material. Thus the idea that viruses are ﬁlterable, small and contain a small number
of genes, is no longer tenable. There appears to be a continuum of size, from the

Semmelweis

smallest picornavirus to the large Mimivirus and Megavirus, larger than the
smallest free-growing bacterium [10].
Emile Roux and Louis Pasteur also developed a vaccine against the rabies virus,
a ﬁlterable agent. This vaccine was tested on a young boy, Joseph Meister, who
was bitten by a rabid dog and was certain to die. He was given many shots of the
vaccine into his belly and he survived the attack. There was much controversy at
the time, since some considered the treatment unethical because the vaccine had
not been properly tested [11]. However, the argument was that without this, the
boy would have died. Although Pasteur had carried out vaccine experiments on
dogs, the claim was made that this was not the vaccine used in the case of the boy.
However, its success led to its adaption as a mode of treatment until very recently
and enhanced Pasteur’s reputation.
Yersin, a researcher at the Pasteur Institute, went on to discover the bacterium
involved in the plague (Black Death) in 1894, initially called Pasteurella pestis but
renamed Yersinia pestis in 1967. He isolated the bacterium from rats and showed
that it was identical to the bacterium associated with the bubonic plague in
humans. Thus the foundations of bacteriology and immunology were laid without
seeing the organisms involved, and without differentiating virus from bacterium.
1.7
Plant Viruses
Pioneering work in microbiology was also carried out on the tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV). This was a ‘‘germ’’ that caused areas of variegation (mosaic) and wilting
of tobacco plants, a crop of economic importance. Many plant viruses, all species-
speciﬁc, cause similar symptoms, the most famous of them the virus that causes
the variegation of tulips. The pattern that developed as the result of the infection
had great economic importance. In fact, it was the rarity of such tulips that led to
the market concept of futures, and to the exchange of large sums of money in the
seventeenth century in Holland (1634–1637), during a period known as tulipma-
nia. Such tulips did not breed true, and the pattern died out quite suddenly. This
caused a ﬁnancial crash, and may be thought of as the ﬁrst stock market crash or
bursting of a ﬁnancial bubble [12] (Fig. 1.11).
None of this related historical experience was understood at the time that TMV
became a topic of scientiﬁc, and perhaps commercial, concern in the 1890s. Adolf
Mayer (1843–1942), director of the Agricultural Experimental Station in Wagen-
ingen, Holland, ﬁrst discovered that TMV was an infectious agent. He is credited
with being the ﬁrst person to extract juice (sap) from infected plants and used it as an
inoculum to infect other plants. He tried to culture the organism but failed to grow it
on media and it was not visible in the then crude microscopes. He concluded wrongly
that the agent was a bacterium that lost activity upon ﬁltration [13].
Dmitri Ivanovski (1864–1920), a Russian scientist, also reported that the
infectious agent for tobacco mosaic disease was ﬁlterable (1892). However, like
Mayer, he concluded that there must be something wrong with the ﬁlter, or that the
agent could not be grown in vitro, or was some kind of spore-forming organism.

Introduction: A Short History of Virology

It was Martinus Beijerink (1851–1931) who made the seminal discovery that the
agent was a ‘‘contagious living ﬂuid.’’ Since the ﬁlters should remove known
bacteria, he used the term ‘‘virus’’ (the Latin word for ‘‘poison’’) to describe such
ﬂuids. TMV went on to be a very important tool in the study of virology and
molecular biology. [13] Beijerink went on to make many major contributions to
microbiology, including the discovery of nitrogen ﬁxation, the process by which
nitrogen in converted by bacterium (rhizobium) into ammonia, a form that plants
can metabolize—a natural organic fertilizer! (Fig. 1.12).

Human and Animal Viruses
The ﬁrst animal virus (ﬁlterable) shown to be infectious was foot and mouth
disease virus (FMDV). This virus has great economic importance, particularly in
the dairy industry of western Europe today. While investigating outbreaks of foot
and mouth disease virus in cattle in 1897–1898, Friedrich Loefﬂer (1852–1915),
(who had previously worked with Koch and helped form the ‘‘Koch Postulates’’),
together with Paul Frosch (1860–1928), described an agent from the pockmarks of
diseased animals that could not be cultivated on the media devised for growing
bacteria. This agent was ﬁlterable, and could be shown, by dilution, to be infec-
tious. By sequential inoculation from animal to animal and serial dilution, these
researchers proved that this was not a toxin but an infectious agent. Thus FMDV
resembled TMV in character. By the turn of the twentieth century, it had been
established that viruses were infectious agents associated with many diseases [14].
As we will see in a later chapter, among the ﬁrst viral diseases to be charac-
terized and prevented was yellow fever, identiﬁed as an infectious disease in 1900,
although it took many years before the actual virus was isolated. This would have
to wait until viruses could be grown in cell culture.
1.9
Viruses and Cancer
In parallel with the work described above, major advances were being made in
research linking viruses to cancer. The relationship between cancer and viruses was
ﬁrst discovered in an avian species (domestic poultry). Unfortunately, the relevance
of disease in non-humans, particularly in non-mammals, to humans was not realized
until 50 or 60 years later. We now know, through examples such as ‘‘avian ﬂu’’ or
‘‘swine ﬂu,’’ that other animals are stricken with the same vectors as man, can
transmit these vectors to man, or act as a reservoir for these diseases. The ﬁrst
reported case of a possible virus related to cancer was the observation in 1908 by two
Danish veterinary researchers, Vilhelm Ellerman and Oluf Bang, who found that
leukemia of chickens could be transmitted by a cell-free extract. Peyton Rous
(1879–1970) at the Rockefeller Institute in New York reported a few years later that
not only leukemia but also solid tumors (sarcomas) were transmissible [15].
Peyton Rous came from a poor Texan family, settled in Baltimore, and received
a BA from John Hopkins University in 1900. Due to an accident that affected his
health, he worked at a Texas ranch. Returning to medical school, he received his
MD degree in 1905 and then worked in the Department of Pathology at the
University of Michigan, and later in Dresden, Germany. Subsequently he received
a grant to do research at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. The director of the
Institute, Simon Flexner, who headed the cancer laboratories, asked him to take his
place since he, Flexner, wished to devote his time to poliovirus research, and
Peyton Rous succeeded him. While working with spontaneous tumors of chickens,
he demonstrated in 1910 that a cell-free extract made from the tumor was
16

transmittable, and that different types of tumors arose from different cell-free
extracts of different tumors. Thus the work of two groups (Ellerman/Bang and
Rous) laid the groundwork for an analysis of the relationship between tumors and
viruses.
Rous received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1966, many years after his
discoveries. Not only did he discover tumor viruses (the Rous sarcoma virus
[RSV], the ﬁrst prototype retrovirus discovered), his research also contributed
greatly to methods of storing blood, crucial during World War I. He gave up
attempting to isolate mammalian tumor viruses a few years after identifying RSV.
It took another 50 years or so before tumor-causing viruses were discovered in
mammals.
1.10
Bacteriophage
The fact that all organisms can harbor viruses was conﬁrmed by the discovery of
bacterial viruses, known as bacteriophage. These were ﬁrst discovered by Frederick
Twort (1877–1950) [16] in England and by Felix d’Herelle (1873–1949), a Cana-
dian working in France. In 1910 d’Herelle, working in Mexico, was alerted to the
presence of dysentery in locusts [17]. He cultured the organism from the insects, and
noted during the growth of the bacteria that there were areas of clearing in the
culture in Petri dishes; however, he did not realize the importance of the discovery
until World War I, when he was working with shigella, a bacterium that also caused
dysentery in humans. D’Herelle realized then that the areas of clearing were plaques
caused by a ﬁlterable agent, namely a virus-infecting bacteria [18]. He also noted
that the culture of bacteria cleared during this infection so that no bacteria were left
(or so it appeared). D’Herelle had hoped that such bacteriophage could be used in
therapy against bacterial diseases [19]. This was an active area of research in the
1930s–1980s in Eastern Europe and Russia and today is an area of renewed research.
The same idea was presented in Sinclair Lewis’s novel Arrowsmith, in which a
physician experiments with bacteriophage to cure common diseases [20].
While working with cultures of Staphylococcus aureus (the bacterium that
causes the common boil) in 1915, Frederick Twort noticed that colonies of these
bacteria were being destroyed, and, like d’Herelle, he found that clear plaques
were formed. He isolated the substance that produced this effect and found that it
was transmitted indeﬁnitely to subsequent generations of the bacterium. He then
suggested that the substance was a virus. Twort was unable to continue this
work, and the importance of bacteriophage was not recognized until the 1950s,
when it became a major tool of molecular biologists and revolutionized the
whole ﬁeld of biology. In chapters on bacteriophage (Chaps. 4 and 16),
I describe the controversy surrounding the discovery of bacteriophage, its pos-
sible use in the treatment of bacterial infections, and the role bacteriophage plays
in molecular biology.

Modern Molecular Biology
An understanding of the molecular organization of viruses began with the crys-
tallization of the, tobacco mosaic virus by Wendell Stanley in 1934. Working with
highly puriﬁed TMV, he was able to identify conditions where virus particles
are arranged in a lattice, so that their molecular features can be elucidated by
the diffraction of X-ray beams. Wendell Stanley received the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry in 1946 for his seminal work. Even at that time it was still believed that
proteins were the genetic material, although the virus did contain some nucleic
acids. It was not until further work with bacteriophage, and simultaneously with
bacteria, that it could be shown that the nucleic acid contained the genetic
information. These were experiments involving DNA transformation in bacillus
[21], and in later experiments with bacteriophage, it could be shown, using radio-
labeled material, that the DNA of the bacteriophage entered the bacterial cells and
replicated and produced progeny phage and not the protein [22] that remained
attached to the outside of the cell (Fig. 1.13).
The advent of modern molecular biology came about with the analysis of
bacteriophage growth and replication. Using bacteriophages such as T2 and
lambda, it was possible to dissect each stage of virus replication, the role of nucleic
acid in the process, quantify the appearance of and the mechanism of mutation,
and develop a model from phage for tumor development, based on the funda-
mental observation that some phage genetic material was integrated into the
bacterial genome. These early studies with bacteriophage, and the parallel studies

with cell culture and the growth of viruses, allowed for the quantization of virus
growth. The number of scientists involved is too many to list, but all the principal
players constituted the phage group, headed by Max Delbruck, that met at the Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratories in New York. They were later joined by James Watson
and Francis Crick of DNA double helix fame.
1.12
Viral Studies in the 1950s
The great virus scourge of the 1940s and 1950s was poliovirus (see Chaps. 3 and
12 on cell culture and poliovirus). A campaign in the United States, spearheaded
by the March of Dimes, was determined to ﬁnd a vaccine against polio. Based on
the earlier work of John Franklin Enders and others, in 1953 Jonas Salk announced
the achievement of a polio vaccine [23]. Salk became not only a celebrated sci-
entist, but also a hero. His vaccine was based on a ‘‘dead’’ virus, which was
followed two years later by a rival vaccine, the Sabin vaccine, based on a series of
attenuated (weakened) viruses [24]. Both vaccines have their pros and cons, and
both are still used today, although in the U.S. the Salk vaccine is considered safer
since it does not involve viruses that can reproduce. However, the introduction of
these vaccines was not without risk since the ﬁrst batch of commercially produced
Salk vaccine contained some improperly inactivated virus particles.
As a result of these vaccines, polio has almost been wiped out, although hopes
to completely eradicate the virus have recently met with setbacks. Those carrying
out the eradication campaign have been murdered in Pakistan, and in other
countries the anti-polio inoculation campaign has been viewed as a political or
cultural threat. Another oral vaccine was developed by Hilary Koprowski and was
used in Africa, but not in the U.S. [25]. This later led to a controversy as to
whether the AIDS virus (HIV) arose from the chimpanzee cells used to grow the
polioviruses, and was thus introduced into the human population.
A major mystery surrounding viruses was (and to some extent still is) their
involvement in cancer. Rous’s sarcoma virus, and later other viruses associated
with cancer in mice, were shown to be RNA viruses (at one time it was thought
that most viruses were DNA viruses). In culture, these viruses were inhibited by
Actinomycin D, a drug known to inhibit DNA- dependent RNA polymerase, the
enzyme involved in mRNA synthesis from DNA, suggesting that these RNA
viruses had a DNA stage. Although this was difﬁcult to believe, eventually two
groups in 1970 independently discovered an enzyme in infected cells (but not in
uninfected cells) that copied RNA into DNA by a complicated mechanism. This
was ‘‘reverse transcriptase,’’ and the name ‘‘retroviruses’’ was given to this class of
virus. The two labs involved were those of David Baltimore and Howard Temin,
classmates from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania [26, 27]. Each made inde-
pendently parallel discoveries and shared the Nobel Prize for their work. The
discovery of this enzyme opened the way to studies of cancer viruses, some of
1.11

which could be linked to human leukemia (HTLV-1) and later on to HIV, the virus
causing AIDS.
The 1970s to the present was an era of major discoveries and technological
break-throughs, and most of the new advances were due to the emergence of
molecular biology. The technological advancement is DNA sequencing that
allowed the sequencing of the DNA and RNA of thousands of viruses. DNA
sequencing can now be done very quickly and inexpensively. The development of
the ‘‘polymerase chain reaction’’ (PCR) revolutionized the identiﬁcation of spe-
ciﬁc genes, the measurement of gene expression, and virus identiﬁcation, because
nucleic acids that were previously in short supply can be ampliﬁed and studied
carefully. Speciﬁc antibodies could be made in cultured cells (hybridomas) using
cell culture techniques. New emerging viruses were discovered and linked to
speciﬁc diseases or plagues (such as Ebola, HIV, Nypah, Hantan, all of which are
known as ‘‘emerging viruses’’).
All of these topics will be covered in more detail in their respective chapters.
What is the situation at the time of this writing?
Smallpox. This is the only viral disease that has been wiped out worldwide.
However, there is still the fear that this virus will be used in biological warfare, or
by terrorists; therefore, stockpiles of the vaccine are necessary, and new methods
of producing the vaccine in culture are necessary for stockpiling. Although vac-
cination has stopped, there are now calls for it to be reintroduced.
Measles. An effective vaccine has been available since 1963; this disease could
be eliminated with a worldwide effort. However, false rumors based on poor
science relating the vaccine to autism inhibited the vaccination program for some
time. The linkage to autism was proven to be false.
Inﬂuenza. Strain-speciﬁc vaccines are available, but new variant strains emerge
periodically and there are signiﬁcant animal reservoirs worldwide (aquatic birds).
Our battle with the ﬂu, including pandemic ﬂu, will be an ongoing one for the
foreseeable future. New vaccines are produced each year based on predictions, and
newer technologies, such as cloning of speciﬁc viral genes resulting in newer
vaccines, are being clinically tested.
Polio. Effective vaccines are available. Scientists are optimistic that this will be
the second viral disease to be completely wiped out. However, there are cultural
problems and resistance to vaccination in certain parts of the world. Efforts are
currently focused on replacing the Sabin vaccine with the Salk vaccine in hopes of
removing attenuated poliovirus, although the oral Sabin vaccine has a ‘‘herd’’
effect and may thus spread in a population and be more useful in Third World
countries. Vaccinating has been held up by civil wars and mistrust of the motives
for vaccination.
HIV. A massive effort to develop vaccines is under way. There are effective
drugs that can be costly and toxic, but they do allow for a normal life span and
chronic condition. Worldwide spreading continues via sexual contact and use of
recreational drugs. An estimated 250,000,000 people have been infected thus far,
with over 30 million deaths. However, with changes in sexual behavior in some
20
1
Introduction: A Short History of Virology

parts of the world, the use of condoms, and the encouragement of male circum-
cision, this disease is on the decline. With time, anti-retroviral drugs will become
more available and cheaper. In the U.S., the disease is now often considered a
chronic infection that gives a feeling of false security, that the disease is no longer
dangerous of lethal.
Ebola. No vaccine currently exists. There is a need to identify the host reser-
voir, possibly bats. A vaccine is being developed.
Hepatitis C. This is now considered the number one challenge in the U.S. and
other developed countries. Spread by the use of shared needles among drug users,
it takes a long time, perhaps 10–20 years, before the symptoms of the disease are
recognized; it can lead to liver cancer.
New viruses are being discovered and entering the human population contin-
uously. As man moves into new environments, or changes social mores, new
viruses are likely to exploit these situations and lead to new pandemics.

Introduction: A Short History of Virology

What Is a Virus?
Abstract
Viruses are built from short sequences of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA
wrapped in a protein shell. Until the invention of the electron microscope, it
was impossible to visualize a virus. The ﬁrst viruses to be visualized were
bacteriophage, which appeared to have a head and tail-like structure. Only the
nucleic acid entered the bacterial cell through the tail. Animal viruses were
described as spherical or rod-shaped; they were bound to receptors and were
taken up by the cell. After the crystallization of the tobacco mosaic virus, there
was much discussion as to whether viruses were ‘‘living’’ organisms; the
controversy continues to this day. Although viruses were deﬁned in part on the
basis of size and ﬁlterability, viruses much larger than the traditional viruses
have recently been isolated. Studies of viral replication indicate that most
viruses self-assemble as a result of interactions between the viral proteins to
form a viral capsid that interacts with the nucleic acid to form the whole. The
viral replication cycle and synthesis is presented in this chapter. Viral
classiﬁcation into a Linnaean scheme has been proposed, but newer methods
using nucleic acid homologies are changing classiﬁcation. Viruses are spread in
the human population by various means, including airborne particles, fecal-oral
contact, clothing, insects, and contact with other animals (zoonosis).
2.1
Definition of a Virus
Although viruses tend to be diverse in terms of the diseases they cause and the
organs they attack, all viruses have a unity of structure and consist of proteins and
nucleic acid. Some viruses are also encased in a lipid membranous envelope
(Fig. 2.1). Their mode of replication is not binary (one divides into two, two divide
into four, etc.), as in most other organisms, but occurs as a burst of thousands of
virus particles from a single virus over a short time. The number of viruses

produced in cell culture or the blood is in the tens of millions per milliliter of
media or blood. This mode of replication alone makes viruses unique. All other
life forms contain DNA as genetic material and RNA as a message or intermediate
for the formation of proteins or other structures. Viruses are also unique in that
they contain either RNA or DNA as the genetic material. To date, no virus has
been discovered that contains both types of nucleic acid as genetic material,
although both types are used during virus replication in the cell. Viruses do not
contain ribosomes, mitochondria or other cell-like organelles, and are thus com-
pletely parasitic. Since they cannot replicate without the metabolic processes of the
host cell, they are genetic parasites. This differentiates viruses from bacteria or
other single-cell microorganisms (e.g., protozoa), most of which can replicate in
culture on their own, although they can also be parasitic. One other feature dis-
tinguishing viruses from other organisms in general is their small size and ability
to pass through ﬁlters. This was certainly a major criterion in the early days of
virology, although large viruses have recently been discovered. Viruses were not
retained by ﬁlters made from diatomaceous earth (kieselguhr), extensively used at
the beginning of the twentieth century. This characteristic was originally used as
the major characteristic in differentiating a virus from bacteria, fungus or protozoa.
André Lwoff, a French microbiologist (who studied lysogeny, which is the
insertion of bacteriophage DNA into the chromosome of a host), deﬁned a virus in
negative terms, using the following characteristics [1]:
• Possessing only one type of nucleic acid.
• Multiplying in the form of their genetic material, i.e., either RNA or DNA. This
is not strictly true, since hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus but replicates as an
RNA intermediate. Retroviruses are RNA viruses but replicate through a DNA.
• Unable to undergo binary ﬁssion and
• Lacking an energy system, including mitochondria and ribosomes.
This is a negative deﬁnition, and stresses the non-cellular nature of viruses.
Fundamentally, then, a virus is a package of genetic information protected by a
protein shell for delivery into a host cell to be expressed and replicated. The virus
eventually takes over the cell completely for its own replication and in the process
may kill (lyse) the cell or, in the case of tumor viruses, can permanently alter the
cell [2].

What Is a Virus?

It was impossible to deﬁne a virus in terms of shape or physical characteristics
until one could be seen; this had to await the development of the electron
microscope. In 1931, two German scientists, Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, invented
the electron microscope (Fig. 2.2). This was a great improvement over the light
microscope and allowed one to actually ‘‘see’’ viruses. One major disadvantage,
however, is that the preparation for visualizing material by EM may distort the
specimen because viable material cannot be used. The EM, as it became, uses
electrons speeded up in a vacuum, aimed at the specimen, and gives an outline of
the structure on an electron-sensitive photographic plate. Ernst Ruska later moved
to the Siemens Company in Germany, where the ﬁrst commercial electron
microscope was developed. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.
2.2
Are Viruses Alive?
Since the crystallization of viruses in 1935, there has been controversy as to
whether viruses are alive or inanimate. The best analogy is to that of a seed. Is a
bean seed alive? It has the properties of life under certain circumstances, but can
be kept in an inert state for years. As soon as it is planted under appropriate
conditions, it becomes ‘‘alive.’’ A virus differs in that it cannot reproduce unless it
is in a host cell. Thus, one may think of the virus as the bean and the host cell as
the soil. Viruses use the metabolism of the host cell, although there are large
viruses, such as smallpox, that carry genes similar to those of the host cell, which

Ruska and Knoll (Wikipedia)
2.1

code for metabolic enzymes, and some genes mimic those of the host cell and thus
disrupt cellular metabolism by acting as decoys. These viral products are termed
virokines. However, even such viruses cannot multiply on their own since they
need cellular components for their replication and protein synthetic apparatus.
Where did those mimicking genes come from? Were these genes derived from the
host cell since they mimic host functions and interfere with these functions, or
were they acquired by the host eons ago from the virus? (This is a controversial
and open question). Thus the virus is at the edge of life, and can exist in two
states—an inert state and a living state.
In 2004, a large virus (Mimivirus) was discovered in a strain of amoeba, [3]. It
is considered and called a virus since it cannot replicate outside its host, and
although it carries genes for many metabolic functions, it does not code for
ribosomal genes, making it dependent on the host cell for protein synthesis. It is as
large as many bacteria, but despite this, it seems to be another example of an entity
at the boundary between living and inert forms. One has to consider a continuum
from the inert chemical (organic chemical) to more complex ones with the ability
to reproduce, which then gives life. The deﬁnition of life or living is an arbitrary
one (see Chap. 4 on bacteriophage), and is deﬁned in different ways by different
scientists and philosophers. The discovery of the Mimivirus has given rise to the
discussion as to whether this is an ancestor of other viruses or is the result of genes
breaking away from the host and becoming independent. An electron micrograph
of Mimivirus is shown in Fig. 2.3, and a schematic in Fig. 2.4.
This virus has an icosahedral capsid of 400 nm in diameter and 125 nm long
closely packed ﬁbers projecting out from the capsid surface (750 nm total length).
The capsid contains the internal core surrounded by an internal lipid layer.
A ﬁvefold axis displays a starﬁsh-shaped structure.
2.3
Viral Structure
Viruses come in two main shapes as seen from electron micrographs: spherical, or
rod-shaped. Some viruses are naked, while others have a lipid envelope around
them, often derived from the host cell (see Fig. 2.1).
In some cases, viruses approach the shape of regular solids. In some of these
viruses, 20 replicas of the same proteins make up the capsid. This can be a single
protein, or three or many proteins, which interact spontaneously when in contact

Mimivirus (ICTVdB)

through template domains at their edges. The bonds between the capsid proteins are
angled so that the complete structure acquires the form of a regular icosahedron.
Figures 2.1, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 illustrate the basic shape of icosahedral viruses.
Spherical viruses exist in two classes: non-enveloped but may have attachments
to the vertices (corners) of the icosahedron (see ﬁgure of adenovirus); or enveloped.
All mammalian living cells are covered by a membrane—the viability of the cell
depends on the integrity of this membrane. Enveloped viruses leaving the cell must,
therefore, allow this membrane to remain intact if the cell is to survive, or even if
the cell eventually dies. This is achieved by the budding of the viral nucleo-capsid
through the membrane, during which the virus becomes coated in a lipid envelope
derived from the host cell membrane or modiﬁed membrane (see Fig. 2.7, 2.8).
Some viruses are rod-shaped, as illustrated by the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)
and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In the case of TMV this rod is made up of
repeating units of a single coat protein enclosing the nucleic acid in Fig. 2.9.
Since viruses utilize the same protein repeatedly for their structure, they require
very few genes. In order to replicate, they need genes to code for their coat protein
and replication. Thus many viruses, such as poliovirus, may contain only enough
nucleic acid for 5–6 genes. In some cases, the same nucleic acid codes for different

proteins by starting ‘‘read-out’’ at various locations on the nucleic strand, or using
both strands of DNA.
In most cases, viruses undergo self-assembly. Apart from a few bacteriophages in
which a scaffolding protein exists, viral proteins interact with each other or with the
nucleic acid almost as if they have magnetic properties to spontaneously form a
stable structure. The ability to undergo self-assembly is inﬂuenced by both pH
(acidity or basic conditions) and salt concentrations. Poliovirus capsids will undergo
self-assembly in the test tube from sub-viral particles. Classical experiments have
shown that mixing RNA of Holmes’ ribgrass virus and the tobacco mosaic
virus protein will give rise to a viable virus. The species propagated will depend
on the source of the RNA, in this case, RNA from Holmes’ ribgrass virus [4].

What Is a Virus?

The ability to undergo self-assembly makes it easy to reconstruct viruses in the test
tube, and has been done for polio and other viruses. Figure 2.10 illustrates the self-
assembly of the hepatitis B capsid.
Thus viruses are small particles containing only a few genes that succeed in
controlling the host’s protein-synthesizing machinery to make more virus. Outside
the living cell, they are completely inert and can only be seen at high resolution via
electron microscopy.

Two types of nucleic acid exist in nature—DNA and RNA. In humans, as in all
replicating organisms (archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes) the genes that make up
the chromosomes are strands of DNA. Viruses contain either RNA or DNA as their
genetic material. DNA in most organisms is a double-stranded structure, based on
Watson and Crick pairing; however, in viruses, DNA and RNA can be either
single-stranded or double-stranded. Since the viral genome is small, consisting in
many cases of just a few genes—some of which code for enzymes involved in
replication—there is a limited amount of genetic material.
The single virus is referred to as the ‘‘virion.’’ It consists of an outer shell
(protein capsid, or membrane), the function of which is to protect the genetic
information from physical, chemical, or enzymatic damage, and a nucleocapsid
containing the genetic information and any required replicating enzymes. The
outer surface of the virus is also responsible for recognition of and attachment to
the host cell. Initially, this takes the form of binding of a virus-attachment protein
to a cellular receptor molecule. One can imagine this as a key and lock mechanism.
Once the virus attaches to the cell, it is engulfed through the cellular membrane
and the viral coat removed in small cellular vesicles, releasing the viral nucleic
acid into the cytoplasm for replication (Fig. 2.11). In the case of bacteriophage, the
viral coat is not taken into the cell, but the genetic material is injected into the
bacterial cell as if through a syringe, with the bacteriophage proteins remaining
attached through their tails.
2.5
Virus Classification
The common names of viruses are associated in many cases with the place the
virus was ﬁrst isolated (e.g., Ebola is the location in the Congo where the disease
was ﬁrst recognized); the organ from which the virus is isolated (e.g., adenovirus
from the adenoids); the symptoms of the virus (pox virus, yellow fever); or, ﬁnally,
with the names of the persons isolating and identifying the virus (e.g., Epstein-
Barr). Using the symptoms caused by a virus can lead to confusion. There are
many viruses that cause what we generally call hepatitis. For example, the
picornavirus hepatitis A causes common jaundice, a self-limiting disease; hepatitis
B causes serum hepatitis associated with blood transfusions; and hepatitis C,

a ﬂavivirus, transmitted in blood and blood products, eventually causing liver
cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Many attempts have been made to classify viruses, following the classical
scheme of Linnaeus, the eminent Swedish botanist. However, since viruses are
quite invisible, and we know them from either the diseases they cause or from their
shape in electron micrographs, it has been very difﬁcult to relate them to each other.
Newer methods of classiﬁcation depend on the molecular structure of the virus,
type of nucleic acid, and mode of replication. More accurate methods in DNA

between enveloped and non-enveloped virus (ViralZone, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics)

and RNA sequencing allow for virus classiﬁcation based on sequence homology.
The relationship between and among viruses is constantly being revised, based on
sequence data.
2.6
Virus Replication Cycle
At the molecular level, the infection of a single cell with a virus can result in the
synthesis of thousands of virus particles. When a virus kills a cell in culture, it is
referred to as a lytic infection and in the whole organism, such as a human as an
acute infection. Examples of this type of infection are poliovirus, the common cold
virus (rhinovirus), and smallpox. Such viruses either ‘‘kill’’ the host or are even-
tually controlled by the immune system and are thus self-limiting.
Some viruses persist for a long period of time, giving rise to chronic infections.
We do not know why this happens, since in many cases the components of the
immune system appear to be functioning normally. It is possible that the virus has
the ability to ‘‘dampen’’ the activity of the immune system or the ﬁrst lines of
defense against infection, such as interferon. This seems to be the case with a virus
such as hepatitis C, which is able to knock out the interferon system (at least in
cultured cells) and possibly also interfere with immune cell activity in vivo, thus
allowing for the persistence of the virus.
Other viruses can integrate into the host genome, resulting in cell transforma-
tion or tumor formation. Such viruses interfere with the cell cycle and cell rep-
lication. Cervical cancer is caused by a papilloma virus, which alters the cell cycle
to its advantage. HIV integrates into the human chromosome, making it impossible
to eradicate completely. Other viruses, such as the herpes viruses, establish a long-
lasting infection, but they also have an acute phase, the formation of cold sores in
or near the mouth, or genital lesions, and a latent stage in which the virus ‘‘hides’’
in neurons, either in the soma or in axons. Chickenpox, also a herpes-like virus,
can remain dormant for years, and then erupt as shingles, usually when the
immune system is compromised, for example during cancer chemotherapy, or
during AIDS infection.
The typical virus life cycle is as follows: The virus interacts with its target cell
and introduces its nucleic acid into the cell. The interaction occurs through the
binding of the virus to a unique receptor domain on the cell membrane (Fig. 2.11).
This receptor is a normal component of the cell and may have other functions.
Virus proteins are made and modify the host cell metabolism so that host proteins
are no longer made, or the host cell replication cycle is affected. All of this is to
allow the virus to produce more of itself, thus diverting cell metabolism to virus
production. The viral proteins are produced in one part of the cell, the replicated
nucleic acid in another, and somehow they ﬁnd each other, interact, and form virus
particles that are expelled from the cell. These viruses then infect nearby cells.
Immediately after infection in vivo, the body reacts by producing interferon and
32

other immune enhancing molecules known as cytokines, which are the ﬁrst line of
defense against the virus; this response is called ‘‘innate immunity.’’ Adaptive
immunity, the production of antibodies for a speciﬁc virus, will not occur until
much later (10–21 days). Symptoms usually occur a few days after infection,
although during this asymptomatic period a person may be infectious. This is
particularly true in the case of viruses such as HIV, where obvious symptoms may
not occur for quite some time (The role of the immune response is discussed in
detail in Chap. 6).
2.7
How Are Viruses Spread?
In discussing the mode of viral transmission, one must consider the tissue or organ
tropism of the virus. Viruses bind to receptor sites on the cells of speciﬁc tissue. It
is the presence of these receptor sites that make an animal or cell susceptible to the
virus. The virus contains unique proteins, occasionally as surface projectiles that
interact speciﬁcally with the receptors. Thus some viruses, such as hepatitis virus,
attack the liver and no other tissue. Other viruses, such as the common cold virus
(rhinovirus), have adapted to cooler body temperatures and infect the lining of the
nose, which is cooler than the rest of the body. Mutations in a receptor—or lack
thereof—can lead to resistance to virus infection. Individuals lacking speciﬁc
chemokine receptor sites, such as CXCR4 and CCR5, are resistant to HIV
infection due to the inability of the virus to bind to cells lacking these receptors.
Scientists divide the mode of virus spread into two categories—direct contact
and indirect contact. Direct contact includes blood-borne transmission, fecal-oral
transmission, airborne spread by droplets or aerosol, contact with bedding, clothes,
etc. (fomites), and vector (usually mosquitoes or other insects) [5]. Indirect contact
spread includes cases where mucus from a runny nose may get onto the hands, or
virus may be left on a surface such as a doorknob, telephone, or countertops, and is
picked up by a second individual, who then touches his eyes or nose, resulting in
infection. For example, cytomegalovirus (a virus of the herpes class) can be
transmitted between children if one child drools on a toy and a second child picks
it up and then put his hands in his mouth or eyes. Viruses can be transmitted in
droplets; however. the area covered is not very large, usually only a few feet
depending on the size of the droplets.
(The exception may be in planes, where the virus droplets may persist and
spread in the dry closed conﬁnement.) An example of common vehicle trans-
mission might be where a food contaminated with hepatitis A is consumed by
many people who all become sick. Vector transmission is a very common means
of transmission; the best studied cases include yellow fever, dengue virus, and
West Nile fever—viruses all transmitted by mosquitoes.
The many modes by which viruses are transmitted are summarized in
Table 2.1.

2.8
Aerosol and Airborne Spread
In studying the spread of respiratory viruses, scientists have concentrated on
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), inﬂuenza, and rhinoviruses, the three viruses
most commonly found in homes, old age homes, institutions and schools. RSV is
the most common respiratory infection in children worldwide. Attendance at
daycare center ensures that a child will be infected with RSV during the ﬁrst few
years of life, and infection results in 0.05–1 % of children being hospitalized with
bronchitis.
Although it would be expected that transmission of RSV would be by airborne
particles, this does not appear to be the case. Transmission takes place by contact,
both direct and indirect. In experiments designed by Hall et al. [6] highly symp-
tomatic infants who were producing abundant secretions were placed in cribs.
Three categories of nurse volunteers were brought into the room. ‘‘Cuddlers’’
played with the infant, changed his or her diaper and performed other routine care.
‘‘Touchers’’ did not touch the baby but had extensive contact with the child’s
environment, which had been heavily contaminated with secretions. ‘‘Sitters’’ sat
next to the crib reading a book for 3 h but did not touch anything in the immediate
environment. Five of the seven ‘‘cuddlers,’’ four of ten ‘‘touchers’’ and not one of
14 ‘‘sitters’’ developed RSV infection. Thus transmission did not appear to be
airborne, since none of the nurses sitting beside the children was infected. The
other nurses were infected either by direct contact with the child, or from secre-
tions that were on the crib or other objects handled by the child. Children with

What Is a Virus?

RSV secrete large amounts of virus, which can be viable for up to 7 h on tabletops
or other surfaces (Fig. 2.12).
RSV is often spread in hospitals (nosocomial spread) through lack of thorough
hand-washing after handling infected children. It is important that all surfaces be
washed down with an effective antiviral compound after exposure to children with
RSV. Detergents containing alcohol are effective in destroying RSV, and anyone
in contact with this infection should wear gloves as a barrier to infection.
Rhinoviruses follow a similar pattern. A 2007 study [7] showed that sick people
leave cold viruses on the things they touch, such as door handles, pens and light
switches. Adults with naturally acquired rhinovirus colds have been found to
contaminate 35 % of environmental surfaces in hotel rooms after overnight
occupancy, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) to
detect viral RNA. In addition, viral RNA on surfaces (light switch, phone button,
and telephone handset) could be transferred to ﬁngertips during activities of daily
life. Although RTPCR measures viral RNA contamination, parallel experiments
testing for growth of virus in cell culture resulted in similar results. Virus could be
found on these objects for as long as 18 h. There are, however, two conﬂicting sets
of data on how rhinoviruses are spread, one maintaining that the virus is pre-
dominantly spread by indirect contact through nasal secretions, the other that the
major mode of transmission is through aerosol. Studies at the University of
Wisconsin have shown that when individuals with a cold are kept in the same
room with uninfected individuals, the virus does spread by aerosol, but not as fast
as expected. It may take hours of exposure for others to contract the cold. How-
ever, in these experiments, virus was not detectable on game chips, suggesting that
in the case of contact infection, there is a need for large amounts of fresh secretion
[8]. Thus, again, hand-washing should be effective against the spread of this virus.
In the last few weeks of spring 2009, pictures from around the world appeared
in the press and on television of people wearing facemasks to prevent the spread of
inﬂuenza (H1N1). Inﬂuenza is predominantly spread by droplets that may travel as

far as six feet and from surfaces contaminated from nasal secretions. Adults can
spread the virus 1 day before becoming sick and up to 7 days after the infection
begins. Children can spread the virus for a longer time.
To avoid the spread of the virus, people should stay away from the sick and stay
home if sick. It also is important to wash hands often with soap and water; if not
available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Linens, eating utensils, and dishes
belonging to those who are sick should not be shared without thoroughly washing
them. Eating utensils can be washed either in a dishwasher or by hand with soap and
water, and do not need to be cleaned separately. Furthermore, frequently touched
surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at home, at work and at school, especially
if someone is ill (http://www.cdc.gov/ﬂu/about/disease/spread.htmCDC).
Secondary infections with pneumonia often occur during an inﬂuenza epidemic.
During a normal outbreak, inﬂuenza targets the elderly. There have been epi-
demics in which younger members of society are targeted, and the great pandemic
of 1918 attacked mostly 20- to 30-year-olds. Experiments indicate that the inﬂu-
enza virus may remain active on various surfaces for a few days, depending on the
type of surface. Inﬂuenza virus spread can be inhibited to some extent by the use of
surgical masks.
2.9
Fecal-Oral Spread
The most prevalent virus spread by this means is the Norwalk (norovirus). These
viruses have been in the news recently due to infections that have occurred on
cruise ships. The Norwalk virus was named for Norwalk, Ohio, where there was an
outbreak in the 1970s. Since there are many species of norovirus, this is now the
ofﬁcially accepted name. This stomach virus ranks second (behind the common
cold) in the occurrence of viral illnesses in the United States. The centers for
disease control (CDC) reported over 267 million cases of diarrhea in 2000, and
estimates about 5–17 % of these may have been caused by a norovirus. Cruise
ships are not the only place where one can pick up this nasty bug; of the 348
outbreaks reported to the CDC between 1996 and 2000, only 10 % were in
vacation settings. Restaurants, nursing homes, hospitals, and daycare centers are
the most likely places to pick up a norovirus infection. Symptoms of norovirus
illness usually begin about 24–48 h after exposure to the virus, but they can appear
as early as 12 h after ingestion of contaminated food. People infected with
norovirus are contagious from the moment they begin feeling ill until at least
3 days after recovery. Some people may be contagious for as long as 2 weeks.
Therefore, it is particularly important for people to practice good hand-washing
after having recently recovered from a norovirus. The major source of contami-
nation is leafy greens such as lettuce, fresh fruit and shell ﬁsh. The most important
precautions against norovirus are hand-washing, laundering of contaminated
clothing and blankets, and cooking shellﬁsh to high temperatures.
36

What Is a Virus?

Another virus spread by this means, from diarrhea and vomiting, is rotavirus.
This virus occurs predominantly in children, although there have been outbreaks in
adults. It also occurs suddenly with an outbreak of fever, vomiting, and stomach
cramps, and usually last a few days. At one time it was the leading cause of death
of young children in the U.S. Since the advent of a vaccine in 2005, its seriousness
has decreased. Prior to 2005, almost all children in the U.S. were infected with
rotavirus before their ﬁfth birthday. In the pre-vaccine period, rotavirus was
responsible for more than 400,000 doctor visits; more than 200,000 emergency
room visits; 55,000–70,000 hospitalizations; and 20–60 deaths in children younger
than 5 years of age (CDC). Many other viruses, such as polio, are spread through
the fecal-oral route and are discussed separately.
2.10
Insect Route
Dengue virus is a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics.
As many as 400 million people are infected annually by dengue virus, which is
caused by any one of four related viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. There is no
vaccine to prevent infection with dengue virus, and the most effective protective
measure is to avoid mosquito bites. When infected, early recognition and prompt
supportive treatment can substantially lower the risk of medical complications and
death.
An estimated 2.5 billion people live in over 100 endemic countries and areas
where dengue viruses can be transmitted. Up to 50 million infections occur
annually, with 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 22,000 deaths—
mainly among children. Prior to 1970, only nine countries had experienced cases
of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF); since then, the number has increased more
than fourfold and continues to rise (see map in Fig. 2.13) (World Heath
Organization).
During the nineteenth century, dengue was considered a disease that sporadi-
cally caused epidemics at long intervals, a reﬂection of the slow pace of transport
and limited travel at that time. Dengue has emerged as a worldwide problem since
the 1950s, and in the last 50 years, the incidence has increased 30-fold. Although
dengue is rarely found in the continental United States, it is endemic in Puerto
Rico and in many popular tourist destinations in Latin America, Southeast Asia
and the Paciﬁc islands (Fig. 2.14).
The reason for the increase in epidemic dengue fever has been the lack of
eradication of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti). With populations moving from the
country to urban areas, there is now a large non-immune population available to
the infected mosquitoes. There has been, over time, an increase in the use of
plastic containers, which are breeding grounds for mosquito larvae. As has also
been shown for yellow fever (see Chap. 10), the availability of old tires ﬁlled with
rainwater is also a locale for breeding. Air travel has helped spread the mosquito
from continent to continent and as a carrier of the disease.
2.9
Fecal-Oral Spread

As in the case of other diseases spread by mosquitoes, the virus replicates in the
gut of the insect, and then accumulates in the salivary gland waiting to be trans-
mitted at the next meal. The extrinsic period (time in the insect before becoming

infectious) is approximately 7 days. There is a similar pattern of infection for the
yellow fever virus.
West Nile Virus is among the most common mosquito-borne viruses in the
U.S., and there is currently no vaccine for it. Only about 20 % of those bitten by
virus-loaded mosquitoes develop fever, body aches, headache, and nausea.
Another 1 % develop neurological problems that can be serious. Humans are a
‘‘dead-end’’ host for the virus, in that it is not transmitted further. The virus is
predominantly found in birds (see http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/resources/pdfs/
Bird%20Species%201999-2012.pdf), which lists those species in which the virus
is found (Fig. 2.15).
2.11
Sexual Transmission
A large number of viruses can be transmitted sexually. These include Herpes
simplex 2, HIV, hepatitis B and papilloma viruses. The mode of transmission is the
same in all these cases, and depends on the level of promiscuity, irrespective of
whether the sex is heterosexual or homosexual. All can be prevented by the use of
condoms or by limiting the number of partners. One of the major problems with

the sexually transmitted disease is that in many cases the infected individual does
not realize that he or she has the infection. Each of these viruses is discussed
separately in later chapters.

A History of Cell Culture
Abstract
Cells from different tissues of plants and animals can be grown and cultured in
artiﬁcial media outside the body. Cell culture started off as tissue culture with
the development of the ‘‘hanging drop technique’’ by Ross Harrison, whereby a
small piece of tissue was placed in a drop of medium (including serum), and
cells migrated from the tissue into the surrounding environment. Further
advances in tissue culture were made by Alexis Carel and Charles Lindbergh,
who grew tissue on glass plates and developed techniques to keep tissue
continuously growing. These techniques developed into cell culture, where cells
could be collected from a variety of sources, separated by trypsin, and grown
into a monolayer if given appropriate medium-containing serum. Such cells of
human and murine origin were used for growing viruses. John Franklin Enders
and colleagues discovered that poliovirus and other viruses could be grown in
cell lines developed from primary cells. These results gave a boost to research
in developing a polio vaccine, as well as to basic virology. In the 1940s and
1950s, plaque assays were developed for animal viruses, and quantitative
methods of measuring viral growth were developed by Salvador Luria and
Renato Dulbecco. In the 1960s and 1970s, methods were developed for clonal
growth of cells in culture using newly isolated HeLa cells. This resulted in a
new area of research—somatic cell genetics—with the development of stable
cell lines. The observation that cells of different species fused in culture led to
the development of somatic cell genetics, and eventually to the formation of
hybridomas to produce monoclonal antibodies.

3.1
The Beginnings
Cells from various tissues of plants and animals can be grown and cultured in
artiﬁcial media outside the body. This technique was developed simultaneously
with research on viral diseases, as discussed in the introductory chapter. Cell
culture, as it is known today, was not developed until the 1950s and should be
differentiated from tissue culture, although both terms are used indiscriminately.
Tissue culture is the culturing of pieces of tissue in an artiﬁcial environment, in
which cells migrate out of the tissue onto an inert surface. Cell culture involves the
harvesting of individual cells from a speciﬁc tissue and maintaining the cells in an
incubator at body temperature (37 C) in a plastic or glass ﬂask, covered with a
rich medium that mimics that of the internal environment of the human body. Both
these techniques allow for many more manipulations than possible with living
animals, and contribute to progress in understanding pathogens without the dis-
turbing interference of the hormonal and immune systems, and the inﬂuences of
the whole organism. Vaccines for many diseases owe their existence to the
development of cell culture.
3.2
Harrison and Carrel
Cell culture developed from research in embryology, developmental biology and,
later, cancer. Early experiments, performed by Ross Harrison (1870–1959) and
Leo Loeb (1869–1959) at the beginning of the twentieth century used tissue or
pieces of organs kept alive in test tubes using blood clots, agar or salt solutions as
the liquid medium. Harrison was the ﬁrst to grow tissue in the test tube while
studying the development of frog nerve ﬁbers. He also pioneered the ‘‘hanging
drop technique,’’ in which tissue was embedded in plasma on the reverse side of a
slide or cover slip. The plasma would form a hanging drop, in which a piece of
tissue would be retained. These were tissue or organ slices that produced cells that
migrated from the explanted tissue on a solid surface. This was quite an
achievement, and depended on progress in elucidating conditions for maintaining
and growing isolated fragments of living tissue (Fig. 3.1).
Another pioneer in this ﬁeld was Alexis Carrel (1873–1944). He advanced and
adapted the Harrison methodology and used tissue fragments from chicks and
various mammals, as well as tumors. He and his colleague Montrose Burrows
(1884–1947) grew these tissues in plasma of the animal of origin in hanging drops,
Fig. 3.1 Harrison’s hanging
drop technique (www.
corning.com)

A History of Cell Culture

and also on slide covers in glass plates. Cells grew out of the tissue, migrated
around the tissue slice and could be transferred serially a number of times to new
glass plates [1, 2]. Carrel invented the ﬁrst tissue culture ﬂasks, called ‘‘D-ﬂasks,’’
which were a prototype of the ﬂasks used today for culturing small amounts of
cells. He also improved growth media, showed that serum could be used instead of
plasma, and that serum from different mammals supported cellular growth. Plasma
is derived from blood by centrifuging down the red blood cells, usually in the
presence of an anti-coagulant such as heparin, while serum differs from plasma in
that some components of plasma, such as the clotting factor, are removed by
allowing the blood to clot and then separating the clot from the supernatant which
is the serum. Modern-day cell culture is dependent on the use of bovine serum,
which is abundantly available. Carrel also emphasized the need for sterile tech-
niques and tested toluene in small amounts as an inhibitor of contaminating
bacterial growth. This was in the period before antibiotics and fungicides, which
are now added to culture media to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination.
The ﬁnding that cells could be grown on a glass surface was a major discovery.
This method is used in many laboratories to this day, rather than plastic surfaces,
since it is more economical and also environmentally favorable. Glass is easily
washed and sterilized. Cells would grow out of the transplants onto most solid
surfaces. Carrel also showed that it was possible to grow cells from chick embryos’
organs and from skin. He claimed to have kept such cultures alive for long periods,
but this is now considered unlikely. It is now thought that these observations were
artifactual, that feeding cells ‘‘embryo extracts’’ may have introduced new cells
into the population, which would thus give the appearance of continuous growth.
Carrel’s contribution to the development of tissue culture was enormous and in
1912 he was the ﬁrst American to receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine.
A major breakthrough, allowing for the growth of large numbers of mammalian
cells in culture for virus production, occurred much later with the use of trypsin, an
enzyme that splits the peptide bonds linking adjacent cells, thus allowing for the
harvesting and transfer of large numbers of cells This is a simple procedure, in
which a small amount of trypsin is added to a plate of cells, or tissue clumps,
allowed to digest the bonds between the cells for a short time, the plate shaken
gently, and the cells are detached from each other and from the glass surface. The
cells are then harvested, diluted and re-plated. Modiﬁcations of this technique can
be used to tease cells from tumors or organs.
One cell line, derived from explanted chick embryo heart fragments in January
1912, was claimed to be successfully sub-cultured hundreds of times. After sur-
viving initial contamination outbreaks that almost wiped them out, they were
looked after by Carrel’s research assistant. He followed Carrel’s methods of
subculture and maintained this cell line until 1946, when the cultures were ﬁnally
terminated. These cultures were widely written about and their anniversary was
celebrated each year in the New York World Telegram. The cultures outlived
Carrel by almost 2 years [3]! However, it is questionable whether this really was
the original culture.

Harrison and Carrel
43

Of interest is the collaboration between Carrel and Charles Lindbergh
(1902–1974). Lindbergh’s aeronautical feats are well known, but he was also an
excellent experimenter interested in advancing medical technology. He developed
methods of separating serum from whole blood and also introduced the use of
Corning Pyrex tissue culture ﬂasks. One advantage of using Pyrex for the ﬂasks
and other equipment is its resistance to high heat, allowing for autoclaving at
between 120 and 170 C for sterilization. Carrel and Lindbergh co-authored many
research papers in the 1930s, and their research led to the subsequent explosion of
knowledge in cell culture techniques in the 1950s–1960s [4]. Very little changed in
the ﬁeld of tissue culture, as it was then known, for the next 25 years, until the
discovery of growth factors and cytokines, proteins of the immune system that
enhance or inhibit the growth of cells. These factors can be puriﬁed and tested as
replacements for the ‘‘unknowns’’ in serum. Many well-known scientists were
trained in Carrel’s laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. (See note
on Carrel in Appendix and his political views and involvement with Vichy France
during World War II).
Among these scientists were Wilton Earle, whose media for growing cells
(‘‘Earle’s medium’’) is still very popular, and Raymond C. Parker (1903–1974),
whose team at the University of Toronto developed the culture techniques for
mass-producing the polio virus, which was used in the ﬁrst successful polio
vaccine in 1954. Testing and perfecting new culture media has made many
advances possible. Most importantly, the advances in polio production were due to
the introduction of a new medium, M199, resulting in larger yields of polio virus
from monkey kidney cells [5]. This medium was originally designed for the
growth of chick embryo ﬁbroblasts and did not require serum. If one peruses
catalogues of media for cell culture today, there is a plethora of media containing
different concentrations of salts, amino acids, buffers, etc., from the 1960s for the
growth of different types of cells. It was not until the 1980s that truly deﬁned
media were developed, using growth factors instead of serum.
3.3
Growth of Virus in Culture
John Enders (1897–1985) was another pioneer in the ﬁeld of cell culture and
virology. He initially studied the replication of vaccinia virus, the virus used by
Jenner in the vaccine against smallpox, and he developed conditions for viral
growth in culture. Enders found that by constantly changing the media, he could
keep cells alive for an extended period. He utilized the methods developed by
Carrel and later by George Gey (1889–1970), in which pieces of minced tissue
were cultured on the sides of a rotating tube that was later developed into the
‘‘roller bottle.’’ The idea behind rotating the culture was that this would allow for
the exchange of nutrients in the media and for respiration during the period that the
tissue was not in the media. Virus was added to chick embryonic tissue and
incubated for 24 h. The virus was subsequently harvested and titred on rabbit skin,
44

A History of Cell Culture

proving that virus replication could occur under these conditions. Moreover, there
was no loss of activity of virus even after 2 weeks’ storage at -20 C. The
development of these techniques was very important and permitted the growth of
virus in vitro rather than in whole animals. Using this approach, various viruses
could be cultured, including equine encephalitis, inﬂuenza and chickenpox (vari-
cella). This really was the beginning of the cultivation of viruses outside the body.
Many of the techniques developed by Enders and his group are still routinely used
in the virology lab today.
It was originally believed that poliovirus, a scourge of the early twentieth
century, could only be grown in cells of human neural origin. Enders tested a
series of human embryonic tissues for their ability to produce virus. By 1948 it was
obvious to Enders and his group that a virus found in the feces of man should be
able to grow in a variety of tissue. Minced tissue was maintained in culture and
poliovirus isolated from mouse brain added to ﬂasks. Samples from the ﬂasks were
harvested at various times and tested for their paralytic effect on mice. Enders,
Weller and Robbins reported in Science in 1949 that poliovirus grew very well on
all these tissues over an extended period, and the calculated yield was very high.
Enders developed methods for growing human cells from the foreskins of babies
circumcised at the local hospital. Quite by accident, an aliquot of poliovirus was
added to human foreskin and the virus destroyed the cells, producing a large yield
of virus [6, 7]. Foreskin thus became the tissue of choice for basic research with
human primary cultures, and a source of cells for growing virus.
In Enders’s Nobel Prize lecture in 1954, one feels the excitement from the
discovery that poliovirus grew in a number of different cell lines. The ﬁnding was
pure serendipity, since, as noted, it was ﬁrmly believed by virologists previously
working in this area that polio could only be produced in human neural tissue.
Enders himself describes the approach taken by his group as being similar to a
ﬁshing expedition. Finding speciﬁc host cells in culture for a speciﬁc virus requires
the testing of many cell lines, and there is often no obvious logic to the cell line
targeted by the virus. For example, HeLa cells (cells derived from Helen Lacks)
support the growth of most viruses, both human and non-human (mouse) and,
likewise, mouse L-cells can support the growth of viruses from different species.
As already pointed out, the idea that polio could only grow in neuronal cells was
based on the observation that in vivo the patient’s nervous system was affected.
Poliovirus is an enteric virus and replicates primarily in the gut, a fact not realized
in the 1930s. Enders demonstrated that polio could grow on human embryonic
tissue derived from intestines, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, brain, heart, spleen, and
lung. His group also studied the cytopathogenic effect of viruses on the culture. It
was also possible to demonstrate inactivation of the virus by polio-speciﬁc antisera
in vitro. Enders and colleagues showed that poliovirus could be grown in most
human tissues in large amounts, thus paving the way for the eventual development
of the polio vaccines by Salk and Sabin (see Chap. 12 on poliovirus) (Fig. 3.2).
John Enders has been called ‘‘the father of the modern vaccine.’’
3.3
Growth of Virus in Culture
45

The development of cell culture techniques revolutionized the whole ﬁeld of
virology. Viruses could now be grown in large volume for both molecular studies
and the development of vaccines. With the discovery of antibiotics, penicillin and
streptomycin were added to synthetic media and prevented bacterial contamina-
tion. Later, fungicide would be added when necessary to prevent fungal growth in
the rich media. Different media were developed for different cells which all grew
with the addition of 5–10 % volume of bovine serum. It became customary to use
bovine or calf serum (or fetal calf serum) for this purpose.
One of the major advances in cell culture was the addition of the protein degrading
enzyme trypsin to the ‘‘tissue’’ culture. This resulted in the breaking of proteolytic
bonds between cells and permitted individual cells to be harvested and re-plated to
form a monolayer of cells.
It has proven difﬁcult to replace all the components of serum in cell culture,
although various deﬁned media have been developed for different cell lines. These
contain different combinations of amino acids, hormones and trace elements.
3.4
Development of the Plaque Assay
Renato Dulbecco (1914–2012), using the techniques developed by his colleague,
Salvatore Luria (1912–1991), who had developed quantitative ways of measuring
phage by a plaque assay, showed that with certain human viruses it was possible to
develop a quantitative plaque assay [8] (Fig. 3.3). When poliovirus was diluted
onto a monolayer of cells, the resulting virus infection cleared the area by killing
the original infected cell as well as the surrounding cells to form a hole, or a
plaque, which could be visualized by staining with a dye such as crystal violet.
Such holes in the monolayer were visible by a light microscope or to the naked
eye. Viruses are prevented from spreading by adding a layer of semi-solid agar.
The advantage of this technique is that all viruses in a single plaque are derived
from a single virus particle allowing for the isolation of puriﬁed stock. It was

possible to quantify virus production, and to select for viral mutants either drug-
resistant, or temperature-sensitive. Other types of viruses were shown to infect and
transform cells, altering their growth properties and the resulting transformed cell
forming colonies in agar. These cells had characteristics associated with cancerous
cells, and could in some cases form tumors upon injection into mice. Both Dul-
becco and Luria received Nobel Prizes independently for different projects—
Dulbecco for his work on tumor viruses, and Luria for his work on phage repli-
cation—and both had worked for periods at Indiana University, Bloomington. Jim
Watson, the discoverer of DNA structure, was a graduate student of Luria’s, who
later moved to the University of Illinois, and ﬁnally to MIT where he headed the
department of microbiology for some time (Fig. 3.3).
3.5
HeLa Cells and Cloning
Over the years, many attempts had been made to culture human tumor cells, but
without much success. However, in 1951 the ﬁrst human tumor cells to grow in
culture were isolated from a cervical carcinoma of a young African-American
woman by the name of Henrietta Lacks. These cells were isolated by George Gey
at John Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore; they were called HeLa after the
donor. HeLa cells grew very aggressively and rapidly in culture. Gey published his
results in 1953 and HeLa cells became available to any scientist who requested
them [9]. HeLa became the workhorse of the cell culture ﬁeld, and were used to
study cell growth, cell reproduction and, of course, to produce virus. Many viruses
that could not be grown before in culture were cultivated in HeLa. Cultures of
these cells could be split in a twofold to tenfold dilution and when transferred to
new ﬂasks, new monolayers developed very quickly in simple media. Gey dis-
tributed these cells to all who requested them, so that almost every tissue culture
lab used these cells. The cells grew so aggressively that many cultures derived

from other human tumors were in fact contaminated with HeLa, and needed to be
tested for unique markers that occur in HeLa.
Importance of HeLa cells
• Could be grown in simple media and in large amounts.
• Had wide host range for viruses.
• Were given freely to all laboratories that requested them.
• Contaminated most other human cell lines.
• Became ‘‘work horse’’ of virology and cell biology.
• Could not be used for genetics studies because of chromosomal aberrations.
• Could be grown from single cell- to form clones.
Gey developed many of the techniques of cell culture used today. With his wife,
Margaret, he developed techniques for ﬁlming and photographing cell growth
within test tubes. He was the founder and ﬁrst president of the Tissue Culture
Association (TCA), an organization founded in 1946 with the purpose of educating
scientists in the ‘‘art’’ of cell culture. A new journal, In Vitro, was launched; its
purpose was to describe cell culture developments. This education program
became so successful that by 1971 the W. Alton Cell Science Center in the
Adirondack Mountains of New York State, was opened as a permanent home for
TCA’s educational programs. This author remembers taking a week-long course in
culture techniques at the center, at which Theodore Puck (1916–2005) and Philip
Marcus (1927–2013), whose contributions are discussed below, were the
instructors. In 1994 the TCA became the Association for In Vitro Biology.
William Earle developed a mouse cell line, similar in growth potential to
HeLa, from mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts. These were known as L292 cells, or
referred to as L-cells [10]. Ted Puck and Phil Marcus [11, 12] proved in the
1960s that it was possible to dilute HeLa cells so that one could achieve ‘‘clonal’’
growth of the cells—that is, single cells would stick to the glass or plastic surface
and daughter cells surround the single progenitor cell, forming a clone of cells all
genetically identical [11]. The era of somatic cell genetics was born from the use
of this simple technique, which allowed the selection of mutants able to growing
in the presence of inhibitors that in turn gave rise to drug-resistant colonies
(Fig. 3.4).
Puck also developed a cell line isolated from Chinese hamsters called ‘‘CHO,’’
which maintained, unlike other cells in culture, a near diploid chromosome
complement. Using selective pressure such as high temperature as well as drugs,
Puck was able to isolate mutant cell lines for the analysis of biochemical pathways,
in particular mutants of the amino acid pathways [13]. Puck hoped that CHO
would become the E. coli of mammalian cells, i.e., a model system for molecular
genetics, and his hope has been fulﬁlled. CHO cells are used to manufacture many
recombinant drugs and cytokines, including human interferons, and are used in the
study of chromosome morphology and cell hybridization. Chromosome behavior
could now be studied in a cloned population of cells [14]. In my own laboratory,
we isolated mutants of CHO cells in purine metabolism [15, 16]; these mutants
48

mimic human genetic diseases of the same pathway. Thus a new ﬁeld of research
was born, as was a new journal, Somatic Cell Genetics (which later became the
Journal of Somatic and Molecular Genetics).
3.6
Birth of Monoclonal Antibodies
Using such cell culture techniques, it was possible to fuse two different cell lines to
form hybrid cells, even between cells of totally different origin (human and
mouse). In mixed culture, fusion occurred spontaneously, albeit at a low rate. By
adding Sendai virus or, in later experiments, non-biological agents such as poly-
ethylene glycol, the rate of cell fusion was enhanced. Many viruses, such as HIV,
herpes and Sendai, cause cell fusion as part of the infectious process. Exploiting
this technique, in 1975 Grigori Milstein and colleagues at Cambridge University
fused myeloma cells (a tumor cell line) and B-cells from the spleen to produce
what they termed hybridomas [17]. These were hybrid cells that had the long life
of the tumor cell and produced antibodies derived from the B-lymphocytes in the
spleen.
The technique involves a series of steps that will be listed below. But ﬁrst it is
important to emphasize that all the antibodies produced by this method are
monoclonal antibodies—that is, each individual hybridoma produces only one type
of antibody and not a mixture as in plasma. Monoclonal antibodies are now being
used to target speciﬁc cancers and are in fact now being tested in clinical trials for
the treatment of lymphomas, a colon and breast cancer. In many cases they are
combined with chemotherapeutic compounds. The most commonly used mono-
clonal antibody in these clinical trials is the one for breast cancer therapy; this
antibody targets the Her2 protein, and is called Herceptin. This is of special
interest because Her2 protein is the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
[18]. Mutations in this gene result in very aggressive tumors.

HeLa Cells and Cloning
49

And now for the technique:
Mice or other animals (especially rabbits) are injected with a single known
antigen that will elicit an immune response characterized by a rapid multiplication
of B-cells secreting antibodies. The resulting population of antibodies is poly-
clonal. Some antibodies are speciﬁc for the antigen selected, but most reﬂect the
past immune experience of the animal. B-cells obtained from the spleen of the
injected animal and cells of a B-cell tumor line (myeloma) with a selective genetic
marker, are mixed in the presence of a fusion agent, such as polyethylene glycol or
the Sendai virus. Treatment of cells with either of these agents results in cell
fusion. The surviving cell population is selected in selective medium (known as
HAT medium) and then screened in 96 well cell culture plates for the production
of speciﬁc antibodies. HAT medium kills cells that have a defective purine
metabolism (deﬁcient HGPRT enzyme)—in this case, the myeloma cells. HGPRT
function is supplied by the fused B-cells. Non-fused B-cells die in culture, since
they are short lived and therefore only the hybrid myeloma + B-cells responding
to the selected antigen survive (Fig. 3.5).
In the 1980s there were major advances in cell culture with the identiﬁcation of
growth factors in serum allowing for the growth of lymphocytes in culture, and the
isolation of stem cells. Robert Gallo, one of the co-discoverers of the HIV virus,
grew T-lymphocytes in culture by the addition of an interleukin, IL-2 (a molecule
that supports the growth of T-cells), thus paving the way for the growth of cells of
the immune system and, eventually, embryonic stem cells [19].

A History of Cell Culture

Thus from this beginning of ‘‘organ’’ culture, then ‘‘tissue’’ culture, one is able
to produce cells industrially, both for the production of vaccines, and also,
unfortunately, for virus as weapons of mass destruction. However, cell culture has
led to the ‘‘stem cell’’ revolution that is ushering in a new era of research.
3.7
Appendix
In 1935 Carrel published a book titled L’Homme, cet inconnu (Man, The
Unknown), which became a best seller. The book discussed ‘‘the nature of society
in light of discoveries in biology, physics, and medicine.’’ It contained Carrel’s
own social prescriptions, advocating, in part, that mankind could improve itself by
following the guidance of an elite group of intellectuals, and by implementing a
regime of enforced eugenics. Carrel claimed the existence of a ‘‘hereditary bio-
logical aristocracy’’ and argued that ‘‘deviant’’ human types should be suppressed,
using techniques similar to those later used by the Nazis.
‘‘A euthanasia establishment, equipped with a suitable gas, would allow the
humanitarian and economic disposal of those who have killed, committed armed
robbery, kidnapped children, robbed the poor, or seriously betrayed public con-
ﬁdence,’’ Carrel wrote in L’Homme, cet Inconnu. ‘‘Would the same system not be
appropriate for lunatics who have committed criminal acts?’’ he asks.
In the 1936 preface to the German edition of his book, Alexis Carrel added
praise to the eugenics policies of the Third Reich, writing that the German gov-
ernment had taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective, the
mentally diseased, and the criminal. The ideal solution would be the suppression of
each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous.
Carrel, although living in the U.S., considered himself French and left his
position during World War II to join the Vichy government as head of an institute
on eugenics. He died in 1944 (before the end of the war), but he has been accused
of being involved in the murder of thousands of mentally defective people and
others suffering from disabilities. However, since he died before he could be
brought to trial, one has to separate the good of the individual as a scientist from
his personal opinions, and the consequences of those opinions. In the case of
Carrel, he saved lives by his approach to medicine and supported those who
destroyed lives by his belief in eugenics.

The Discovery of Bacteriophage
and the d’Herelle Controversy
Abstract
Bacteriophage (bacterial viruses) were discovered independently by two
scientists, Frederick Twort and Felix d’Herelle, in 1915 and 1917. D’Herelle
went on to carry out an in-depth study of these viruses, including replication
and adaptation, and he proposed their possible use in anti-bacterial treatment.
He called this area of research ‘‘bacteriophagy.’’ This research should be
considered the beginning of molecular biology. D’Herelle was a very
controversial character and had difﬁculty with the scientiﬁc establishment
accepting his ideas and results, as they doubted the existence of bacteriophage
and the concept of phage therapy. The opposite view was that lysis by
bacteriophage was the result of autocatalysis. During this period, an institute of
phage therapy was established in the Soviet Republic of Georgia by Giorgi
Eliava, a colleague of d’Herelle’s at the Pasteur Institute. D’Herelle was invited
to work at the institute but Eliava was executed during a purge shortly after its
opening in 1937.
4.1
Discovery of Bacteriophage
That viruses are ubiquitous and can infect ALL living things was reinforced with
the discovery of bacteriophage. That bacteria can be hosts for viruses was cor-
roborated by the discovery of bacterial viruses, later termed ‘‘bacteriophage.’’
These were ﬁrst observed by Frederick Twort in England [1] and Felix d’Herelle,
[2] a French-Canadian working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Twort was
attempting to grow vaccinia virus in an artiﬁcial medium, without a host cell, when
he noted a micrococcal contamination in the growth tubes. He describes an unu-
sual effect on these bacterial colonies ‘‘…inoculated agar tubes often showed
watery-looking areas, and in cultures that grew micrococci it was found that some

53

of these colonies could not be subcultured, but if kept they became glassy and
transparent’’. He attempted to isolate the substance that produced this effect, but
was unable to detect anything under a microscope. He found that by touching this
transparent area with a loop and transferring it to other cultures, it had a similar
effect, and he thought of this as an infection of the culture. Even years afterwards,
it was not clear to Twort whether this was a viral infection of the culture or an
enzyme that caused autocatalysis of the bacterium. The fact that his interpretation
was unclear had serious consequences later in a controversy that developed on
whether bacteriophage were viruses or an autocatalytic enzyme. In his paper he
concludes, ‘‘…from these results it is difﬁcult to draw deﬁnite conclusions…
[This] may be living protoplasm that forms no deﬁnite individuals or an enzyme
with the power of growth…In any case, whatever explanation is accepted, the
possibility of its being an ultra-microscopic virus has not been deﬁnitely disap-
proved because we do not know for certain the nature of such a virus… On the
whole it seems probable, though by no means certain, that the active transparent
material is produced by the micrococcus, and since it leads to its own destruction
and can be transmitted to fresh healthy cultures it might almost be considered as
an acute infectious disease of micrococci’’ [1, 3].
Twort did not have the funds available to pursue this matter further and his
ﬁndings lay in obscurity for a number of years. His paper was not rediscovered
until much later, during the controversy surrounding the work of d’Herelle
described below. The evidence indicates that d’Herelle was not familiar with
Twort’s work when he later published his discovery of bacteriophage in 1917.
Felix d’Herelle was born in Montreal in 1873, but educated in Paris, his family
having moved back to France when he was 7 years old. On completing high school
in Paris, he moved to Bonn where he attended classes for a few months, but never
completed a university degree; he was thus a self-taught microbiologist. He
studied microbiology from books, and built a home laboratory. Through a family
friend he received a commission from the Canadian Government to study the
fermentation and distillation of maple syrup. Together with his brother he invested
money in a chocolate factory that soon went bankrupt. During this period,
d’Herelle published his ﬁrst paper in Le Naturaliste Canadien on the formation of
carbon by plants. Although the claims in the paper were erroneous, it did show
some scientiﬁc aptitude. Always an adventurer, he then took a position as a
bacteriologist at the General Hospital in Guatemala City. Although not a physi-
cian, some of his work was on the major diseases of that time—yellow fever and
malaria. In 1907 he received an offer from the Mexican government to continue his
studies on fermentation, a topic that interested him from his early bacteriology
experiments. He and his family moved to a sisal plantation near Merida, in the
Yucatan, and he developed a method of producing schnapps from sisal. As far as I
am aware, this was never a commercial success.
During his stay at the sisal plantation in Merida, he attempted to stop a plague of
locusts. He noted that the locusts appeared to be infected by an organism that
caused diarrhea (dysentery). He cultured the causative organism, a bacillus from the
insects. During growth of the bacterium, he noted areas of clearing in the culture but
54

The Discovery of Bacteriophage and the d’Herelle Controversy

did not realize the importance of the discovery until a few years later. However, he
did attempt to stop the locust plague using the bacillus he had isolated from their
guts. He used this bacillus again against locusts a few years later in Argentina. This
was probably the ﬁrst case of attempted biological control of an insect pest.
He was asked to investigate an outbreak of severe dysentery that occurred
among a group of soldiers in Paris during World War I. He isolated and charac-
terized a unique strain of dysentery bacillus and during culture noted holes in the
bacterial lawn. D’Herelle realized then that the areas of clearing were plaques
caused by a ﬁlterable agent (he passed the solution of ‘‘phage’’ through ﬁlters), and
called this a bacteriophage, a bacteria-eating entity. He claimed that this was a
virus that infected bacteria, and he also noted that the culture of bacteria growing
in liquid, and which was usually turbid, cleared when this ﬁltrate was added to the
culture and bacteria did not survive. Emile Roux, his supervisor at the Pasteur
Institute, read d’Herelle’s paper on the discovery of bacteriophage at a meeting of
the Académie des Sciences on September 3, 1917 (for details on d’Herelle’s life,
see Summers [4], and Hausler [5]).
4.2
Bacteriophagology
D’Herelle himself published his research on bacteriophage in a monograph, ‘‘The
bacteriophage and its behavior,’’ as well as many subsequent papers and books
[6–9]. This study was the basis of what he called ‘‘bacteriophagology.’’ He
introduced new terminology to describe the events happening after infection and
describes in some detail the puriﬁcation and titration of bacteriophage cultures.
He also noted that different strains of bacteria (even of the same genus) produce
different bacteriophage and grow under different conditions and were thus very
host-speciﬁc. His initial approach was basic: showing that actively growing,
viable bacteria were optimal for producing phage and that one could titer (cal-
culate the number of) phage by serial dilution. He also made the important point
previously discovered by Martinus Beijerink for plant viruses, such as tobacco
mosaic virus, that bacteriophage were obligate parasites and could not be grown
without a host bacteria. His monograph reads like a lab manual, including
techniques for plaque assays and isolation of what he called the corpuscles. He
showed that each plaque was derived from a single phage infection and that
plaques contained thousands of new phage.
D’Herelle also describes increases in virulence with passage of the phage in its
or other host cells as well as decreases in phage ‘‘activity’’ by high temperatures.
Unaware of its importance, he describes adaptation of strains (he calls them races)
of bacteriophage to different strains of bacteria as a result of numerous passages. It
is possible that he was isolating mutants of the phage and resistant strains of
bacteria. Later in life, as a faculty member at Yale, he did isolate speciﬁc mutants
of phage and their hosts. He also suggested that bacteriophage were particulates
and developed antisera in rabbits to speciﬁc phage. He presented his work with

great enthusiasm at international meetings, and was ready to meet criticism, which
he ran into—head on. It is fair to suggest that he was the founder or ‘‘father of
modern molecular biology,’’ since much of the pioneer work done by him was
later repeated by the Cold Spring Harbor phage group in the 1950s.
d’Herelle and his many collaborators published numerous papers on the char-
acteristics of bacteriophage, and later on their possible clinical applications. He
proposed that phage produced a sort of immunity to bacterial diseases and that
many bacterial diseases, such as cholera, bubonic plague, and dysentery could be
controlled by using phage in a therapeutic fashion. Unfortunately, he was not
interested in the basic science of virology, but only in clinical adaptation of his
work, although during his time at Yale he did basic research on bacterial mutants
or, as he called it, adaptation. He concluded that bacteriophage are viruses and are
alive, a controversy that later dogged virology for many years after the crystalli-
zation of the tobacco mosaic virus by Wendell Stanley. In his chapter called ‘‘The
criteria of life,’’ he argues that a major component of living is the ability to modify
the environment to make more of oneself. He proposes two fundamental properties
of life, the assimilation of heterologous media to make more of oneself different
from the original medium, and the power of adaptation. We have no doubt that a
bacterium is living, since it uses a deﬁned (or undeﬁned) medium to make more of
itself—in the same way the phage uses the bacteria as its medium, to reproduce
more of itself. He argues that what is important in this deﬁnition is the heterolo-
gous medium. ‘‘Assimilation in a heterologous medium implies the power of
modifying the heterologous substances contained in this medium rendering them
comparable to the distinctive substances of the being which brings about the
transformation.’’ Thus, phage use bacteria as their heterologous substance and
convert it to more phage, in the same way that sheep convert grass to more of
themselves.
‘‘The power of adaptation may be deﬁned as the faculty possessed by a being to
respond to a speciﬁc opposing reaction to variations in the conditions of the
medium.’’ D’Herelle was a disciple of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and believed that
organisms adapted to their environments rather than the environment selecting for
mutants. Although discredited for over 200 years, we now believe that some
aspects of Lamarckism, such as changes in DNA in vivo due to environmental
pressures, may explain genetic adaptations. At the chemical level, this would be
due to methylation or other alterations in DNA (coined epigenetics).
Of course d’Herelle had no idea that phage actually contained its own genetic
material and thus instructed the cell to make more phage using pools of nucleo-
tides and amino acids derived from the host. The concept of a gene at that time was
a very hazy one.
D’Herelle also made the observation that certain strains of bacteria were
‘‘lysogenic,’’ i.e., they carry bacteriophage in a latent, non-infectious fashion. This
observation was also made by some of his rivals and led to further controversy as to
whether such an organism as a bacteriophage really exists. Without discussing the
mechanisms of lysogeny, d’Herelle implies that one can isolate strains of bacteria
that seem to carry ‘‘contaminating’’ phage (We will discuss the phenomenon of
56

lysogeny in more detail later; see following chapter). However, d’Herelle’s oppo-
nents used this as proof of their theory that bacteriophage were ‘‘enzymes’’ pro-
duced under certain circumstances by the host cell.
4.3
Phagotherapy
D’Herelle’s primary interest was in the clinical relevance of bacteriophage. He
attempted to correlate the pathogenicity and severity of a disease with the presence
of bacteriophage speciﬁc for diseases causing bacterium. He isolated phage from
patients and assayed them on both laboratory indicator bacterial strains and bac-
terial isolates of the patients. Such studies were performed with isolates from
patients with dysentery, typhoid fever, and later, on a much larger scale, with
isolates derived from patients suffering from bubonic plague and cholera. He and
his colleagues claimed that in the majority of cases, it was the presence of the
bacteriophage and the subsequent destruction of the pathogenic strain of bacteria
that resulted in the alleviation of symptoms. He also described cases of resistant
bacteria and described situations in which the bacteriophage is less active and the
condition of the disease more severe. Similar studies were done with the agents of
bubonic plague (Yersinia pestis) and staphylococcus infections. D’Herelle even
proposed that this occurs in plants, as in the case of legumes infected with Bacillus
radicicola and its phage. He wrote, ‘‘The bacteriophage is as much an infectious
agent as the bacterial it is using as a host, and there is a constant struggle between
the bacterial host and the phage.’’ If the phage ‘‘wins’’ this struggle, the disease is
attenuated or resolved. Using this rationale it should be possible to use bacterio-
phage to treat or, as d’Herelle calls it, ‘‘immunize’’ against a bacterial infection.
Although the work of many investigators did not show any improvement in
experimental infections in rabbits using phage, d’Herelle states that he is unin-
terested in these experimental systems, since the bacteriophage ‘‘immunity’’ only
works in the natural infection. He proposed that during a natural infection, where
phage are present, the infection would be self-limiting due to the destruction of
bacterial cells; if phage were not present, then the infection would be more severe,
and in most cases, fatal. He tested this hypothesis by adding phage to three very
different infections: avian typhosis, which is an enteric disease of chickens; sep-
ticemia of cattle (barbone of buffalo); and a toxic disease, shigella, in rabbits.
These treatments were all carried out in the ﬁeld and were successful.
Claims were made that a single injection of the appropriate phage cured
bacillary dysentery and staphylococcus infections, although d’Herelle suggested
that a cocktail of phage types may be necessary to overcome resistance (and I
assume to ﬁnd the right phage), an approach that was later used in clinical practice
in the Soviet Union. The results obtained in the treatment of bubonic plague were
encouraging, as they were for other bacterial diseases. D’Herelle termed this
‘‘phagotherapy.’’ This novel approach to curing disease was portrayed in in 1925
in Sinclair Lewis’s book Arrowsmith, in which a physician experiments with
bacteriophage to cure bubonic plague in the West Indies.

D’Herelle and the Phage Controversy
Without a doubt, there was a great deal of controversy surrounding d’Herelle’s
discovery and his interpretation of data. This in part originated from the character of
d’Herelle himself, as well as from bitter scientiﬁc rivalries. D’Herelle was an
adventurer who travelled to many countries on many continents. He had no formal
education in microbiology, although his self-learned techniques were exemplary.
This lack of a formal education and thus an academic degree meant that he did not
have a stable position at any institute. He was given space in different laboratories at
the Pasteur Institute, but did not really have a lab or ﬁnancing of his own until later in
life. His discovery of bacteriophage led to the controversy of whether this was a
virus (as he proposed) or some catalytic enzyme produced by the host cells that led
to their own destruction. His major adversary was the Nobel Prize-winning
immunologist Jules Bordet, who refused to believe that bacteriophage were inde-
pendent viruses, but tried to ﬁt d’Herelle’s data into his own interpretation, based on
the interaction of anti-sera and complement leading to lysis of the bacterial cell. He
proposed (as did Twort earlier, and even some of d’Herelle’s own colleagues) that
the destruction of the bacterial cells resulted from autocatalysis [10]. It appears that
there were stormy sessions at various scientiﬁc meetings between d’Herelle and his
supporters on the one side, and Bordet and other immunologists on the other. Even
as late as 1934, a paper by Monroe Eaton and Stanhope Bayne-Jones [11] in the
Journal of the American Medical Association still questioned the concept of bac-
teriophage as viruses and listed a long list of failures of bacteriophage therapy in
experimental animals, although there was some success in the treatment of staph-
ylococci infections and enteric infections. This paper is particularly biased against
the use of bacteriophage as curative agents and even doubts the existence of bac-
teriophage. Why there was so much bitterness towards the idea of bacteriophage as a
clinical cure is not clear; one of the reasons may have been the ‘‘commercialization’’
of bacteriophage treatment by pharmaceutical companies, without strict quality
control—or simply antagonism to d’Herelle the man.
By the 1940s, d’Herelle’s idea that bacteriophage were particulate viruses
began to attract more support. New methods and new investigators sided with
d’Herelle, although there was still some opposition. The development of the
electron microscope, and the work of Helmut Ruska in 1939 and Salvador Luria in
1942 [12] showed phage particles attached to bacterial cells. By 1942, d’Herelle’s
concept had won. It was obviously a long, difﬁcult ﬁght to persuade some
immunologists and other microbiologists about the existence of phage (Fig. 4.1).
D’Herelle was obviously a very colorful and controversial character. Quoting
an excellent paper by Donna Duckworth [13] everywhere that d’Herelle went there
were ﬁreworks. He was well travelled, gave many lectures on his bacteriophage
phenomenon, and speculated on the origins of life and the role of viruses in this
origin. He also spent considerable time in the Soviet Union, not something to
endear him to American scientists. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize
countless times, Hausler [5] but unfortunately until very recently [4] was absent
58

from the history of microbiology. He was awarded three honorary degrees in
medicine, which allowed him to use the title ‘‘doctor,’’ although after his
appointment to the faculty in Yale he became professor. He also had problems at
Yale because of his arrival many months after the beginnng of his appointment,
and also because of illness, suggested by some to be due to hypochondria, although
in truth he had caught a number of infectious diseases in the tropics (he suffered
from malaria and amoebiasis). In addition, a self-inoculation of tetanus vaccine led
to some paralysis. At Yale he was a subject of controversy, travelling and giving
talks most of the time rather than working in his laboratory and teaching [4].
4.5
Phage Institute in Tiflis (Tbilisi)
D’Herelle was at Yale from 1928–1933. He had many arguments with the
chairman of the microbiology department, and when his colleague from Paris,
George Eliava, offered him a position in Tiﬂis (now Tbilisi) in the Soviet Republic
of Georgia, he jumped at it. During this period there were some suspicions at Yale
that he was running a commercial business from Paris, where he spent his summers
(at the Laboratoire du Bacteriophage, which supplied phage stocks commercially.)
In 1923 Eliava returned to Tiﬂis from Paris to work on bacteriophage therapy, and
he established the Tiﬂis Bacteriological Institute, to study the use of bacteriophage
in clinical and epidemiological outbreaks. He received encouraging support from
the Soviet government and established the All-Union Bacteriophage Institute,
today known as the Eliava Institute. (This was during a period when the Soviet
Union encouraged novel research in medicine.)
When d’Herelle decided to leave Yale, Eliava offered him everything he wanted:
a new institute with colleagues interested in phage therapy, a government interested
in his work, and the added attraction, the ideology of ‘‘scientiﬁc socialism.’’
D’Herelle arrived in Tbilisi in 1933, leaving an economically depressed USA for
what appeared to be a prosperous USSR. His laboratory was well funded, and he was
given good living conditions and even a chauffeur. Unfortunately, this situation did
not last long, since Eliava fell victim to the Stalinist purges. He was arrested per-
sonally by Stalin’s chief of police, Lavrentiy Beria, and executed immediately,
although it is not clear why. He was a bit of a playboy and Beria may have been

‘‘in love’’ with his wife or mutually attracted to another woman, possibly the
librarian of the institute [14] (Fig. 4.2). D’Herelle then returned disappointed to
Paris, where he continued to carry out research in the private company he had
established, but continued to collaborate with colleagues at the Tiﬂis institute. This
company supplied phage for therapeutic purposes. The laboratory in Paris produced
phage against carbuncles, dysentery, and wound infections.
This was a very productive period both for d’Herelle and, in particular, for
Professor Alexandr Petrovich Tsulukidze, who produced 14 papers on the subject
between 1935 and 1957. Tsulukidze remained in Russia and headed a team that
tested bacteriophage for war wounds during the Finnish campaign. By 1946, phage
therapy had become ﬁrmly established in the Soviet Union. During World War II,
d’Herelle had moved to Vichy, but his son-in-law remained in Paris throughout the
war, in charge of the research laboratory and business. D’Herelle and his group
examined phage preparations prepared in other laboratories from other countries
and concluded that most were not ‘‘capable of effecting recovery from infectious
disease.’’ In part. he blamed this on capitalism and the proﬁt motive, which he
claimed never entered into his work.
There was active research and clinical use of bacteriophage in Russia and in
Poland. Since d’Herelle’s phage was used with mixed results to treat various
infections by the German and Soviet armies during World War II, and also
extensively explored in the U.S. before the advent of antibiotics, with the pro-
duction of antibiotics in the 1940s, particularly penicillin and streptomycin, the use
of phage as a therapeutic agent disappeared from medicine in the U.S. and western
Europe. With the observations today, in the twenty-ﬁrst century, of antibiotic-
resistant strains of bacteria, particularly among pathogenic organisms such as
staphylococcus, bacteriophage therapy is again being explored. It has been
reported to be very successful, and is now being studied in the West. Although the
clinical trials in eastern Europe may not have met western (U.S. and U.K.) stan-
dards, they did show a high rate of response, and if the reports are to be believed,
many outbreaks of bacterial infections were controlled by the judicious use of
phage. Most of this work was done at the Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage and
Microbiology in Tblisi in the ex-Soviet Republic of Georgia, where to this day
there is a large collection of phage that could be used clinically—in particular
against cholera.

The Beginnings of Molecular Biology
Abstract
This chapter describes the beginnings of molecular biology with the discovery
of bacterial transformation and identiﬁcation of DNA as the genetic material.
The role that bacteriophage and the Cold Spring Harbor Phage group played in
this development are emphasized. The discovery of transducing phage and the
regulation of gene expression in the temperate phage lambda led to models of
transcriptional and translational control. The discovery of lysogeny, and the
integration of the bacteriophage into the host chromosome, ultimately led to the
idea of cancer viruses being integrated into the chromosome and the oncogene
model of cancer.
5.1
Early Studies with Bacteriophage
Virology began its venture toward the understanding of molecules with the
crystallization of the tobacco mosaic virus by Wendell Stanley in 1935 [1].
Working with highly puriﬁed TMV, he identiﬁed conditions where virus particles
were arranged in a lattice so that X-ray beams could elucidate their molecular
features by diffraction, and Stanley received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946
for his groundbreaking work. Even at that late stage in the 1930s, proteins were
considered to be the genetic material, although the virus was shown to contain
small amounts of nucleic acids, not thought to be of great importance.
Although the importance of bacteriophage as therapeutic agents waned in the
1930s, they became of interest as models for the study of viruses and their structure.
The discovery that it was possible to crystallize a virus [1] had an enormous impact
on the ﬁeld. In the 1930s, Max Schlesinger reported that bacteriophage could be
studied by chemical and physical-chemical techniques. He was the ﬁrst to obtain a
pure culture of the bacteriophage, WLL (later identiﬁed as one of the T-even phages)

of Escherichia coli [2] by passing a suspension of the bacteriophage through a
colloidal ﬁlter with a graduated range of pores and then precipitating it in an
ultracentrifuge. He also reported that the phage preparation contained high levels of
a Feulgen staining material, now known to be nucleic acid [3].
A group at the California Institute of Technology, including physicist Max
Delbruck, were interested in studying the origins of life and the mechanisms of
replication of all organisms. They initially studied embryology and explored
problems of importance in biology to the physicist. For this purpose, they decided
to study viral replication, and the simplest available system was the bacteriophage.
In order to do this, quantitative techniques were essential. In 1939, Ellis and
Delbruck [4] developed the one-step growth curve for bacteriophage. (In fact,
d’Herelle had performed similar experiments but these appear to have been for-
gotten.) The question posed was whether one could infect a bacterial cell with a
single phage particle and measure both the changes occurring inside the cell, and
the production of bacteriophage from that cell under experimental conditions.
Luckily these experiments were performed with a virulent phage, isolated from
sewage ultra-ﬁltrates that grew rapidly on the common enteric bacterium, E. coli.
This particular phage formed large visible plaques on a lawn of bacterial cells.
Delbruck, who rediscovered the ‘‘Poisson distribution’’ originally published in
1837 that dealt with random sampling, developed a mathematical approach to this
problem. From such experiments, the burst size from a single phage infection, and
the time of the burst (extent of the replication cycle), were calculated.
5.2
The Phage Group
In 1940 the phage group that was formed for the study of the replication of
bacteriophage consisted of Alfred D. Hershey, Salvador Luria and Max Delbruck.
This group was later expanded to include other scientists interested in the physical
structure of bacteriophage, and was centered in Cold Spring Harbor, on Long
Island. In 1945 Delbruck began his annual phage course, which ‘‘spread the word’’
about the usefulness of bacteriophage to study what was eventually to become
molecular biology. It helped that these meetings were held at Cold Spring Harbor,
a beautiful spot on Long Island. The meetings became known not only for bac-
teriophage biology but for many topics in molecular biology, and, later on, topics
in genetics and medicine. The last evening of the meeting, with a fancy lobster
dinner, was always an added attraction, and became a tradition of the Cold Spring
Harbor meetings.
It was not until further research with bacteriophage, and simultaneously with
bacteria, [5] that it could be shown that the nucleic acid carried the genetic
information. These experiments included DNA transformation in bacillus, and
later experiments with bacteriophage, in which it could be shown using radio-
labeled material that the DNA of the bacteriophage entered the bacterial cells,
replicated and produced progeny phage, and that the protein did not carry the
64

The Beginnings of Molecular Biology

genetic information as previously thought [6]. The protein coat of the phage
remained attached to the outside of the cell. This was a seminal discovery in
molecular biology (see Fig. 5.1). DNA was the genetic material, the basis of
inheritance, and not protein as was thought until the mid-1940s and early 1950s.
These experiments deﬁned an eclipse period, when no phage is detected even
inside the infected cell. The importance of this discovery should not be underes-
timated since unlike other organisms, the absence of phage during the ﬁrst period
after infection indicated that events took place in the cell without the intact phage
being present. In fact, phage structural components could not be detected in the
infected cell for quite some time, suggesting that replication occurred in a fashion
quite different from that seen in other organisms. Similar results were later
reported with animal viruses.
One of the most important advances in virology was the development of the
electron microscope (EM), already referred to in Chap. 2. Ernst Ruska and Max
Knoll invented the EM in Germany in 1931–1933, and the Siemens Company
patented the microscope and then developed its application to biological samples,
initially to visualize poliovirus. Ruska was a German physicist who received the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986 for his work on developing the EM. Ruska, Edgar
Pfankuch and Gustav Kausche (1940) were the ﬁrst to study bacteriophage
preparations with the EM, and in 1941 Ruska described sperm-shaped particles.
He was uncertain whether these were virus or components of the host bacteria [7].
The ﬁrst paper published in English on this subject (others were in German), was
that of Luria and Anderson [8] on the structure of bacteriophage as seen by
electron microscopy. They described various isolates of phage, showing the
presence of a head and tail-like structure, the attachment of the phage to the
bacterial host, and also variations in morphology with different phage, some
having long tails with brush-like appendages, others just straight tails or stubs
(Figs. 5.2, 5.3). This report, however, was met with skepticism in some circles;
one interesting question was whether the tails were ﬂagella-like and gave motility

to the phage particle. It was later shown that the tails were not ﬂagella, but
instruments of delivery of the nucleic acid. These were not simple structures, but
quite complicated appendices and appeared to act like syringes after attaching to
the outside of the bacterial host.

Fig. 5.3 Schematic structure of phage T4 with parts labeled (www.cronodon.com with per-
mission). The tail ﬁbers attach to the cell wall of the bacterium. The tail pins also attach to the cell
wall and bring the tail tube in contact with the surface. This causes the tail tube to contract like a
hypodermic syringe, and the DNA in the head is pushed into the bacterial cell where it undergoes
replication, transcription and translation to produce thousands of new phage particles
66

The Beginnings of Molecular Biology

An important observation made in these EM studies was that the phage par-
ticles themselves appeared to ‘‘stick’’ to the bacterial cell wall and not enter the
cell. This led to the discussion of whether this was analogous to monospermy, in
which only one sperm enters the egg to fertilize it, a characteristic of the higher
bisexual world. Was it possible that only one phage particle entered the cell and
this event blocked other phage particles from entering the cell? We now know that
many phage particles can enter the cell; however, if a cell is infected with too
many particles, it may ‘‘lyse’’ from without. Later work using radioactive tracers
would show that the protein components of the phage (the head and tail) never
entered the cell, only the nucleic acid component not visible by electron
microscopy [6]. This is not true of animal viruses, which are completely engulfed
by the cell.
Delbruck insisted that his group work speciﬁcally with phage that affected
E. coli strain B and not others, and to concentrate only on these; this proved to
be a signiﬁcant and important decision. These were the T-phages that were
‘‘well-behaved’’ in that they were easy to quantitate in a plaque assay. They
became known as phage T1-T7, in order of isolation, and later were divided
into the T-even phages and T-odd phages. Some of them, such as T1, formed
huge plaques that for anyone working with other phaged were a menace since
they easily contaminated cultures. These T-phages became the ‘‘workhorses’’ of
virology and later of molecular biology. The experiments of Hershey and Chase
described above [6] are among the most important in the birth of molecular
biology. The identiﬁcation of nucleic acid as the basis of genetic information
opened a new area of biology: molecular genetics. Studies on mutations in
bacteria and bacteriophage would eventually lead to the deciphering of the
genetic code [9–12].
Studies by Doermann and others indicated that infection with two different
phages often led to recombinant phage, suggesting that the DNA of the phage was
mixed and compartmentalized during replication in the cell, underwent recombi-
nation by a mechanism of strand switching, and was packaged into the phage head
[13, 14]. The isolation of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants and advances in
electron microscopy allowed one to study the intracellular events after phage
infection. It was thus possible to visualize components of the phage as well as
accumulation of nucleic acid (black spots in the EM) and the stages of assembly.
Thus, phages were assembled inside the cell, either under instruction from a
speciﬁc gene, or from interactions between proteins (self-assembly). The DNA
was packaged into the phage head (see Fig. 5.5). Utilizing different mutants, phage
could be self-assembled from two mutants in vitro by mixing the components.
Using temperature, it was possible to look at this assembly as if in slow motion
photography. Using ts mutants, one could visualize the components of the phage,
including tail structures and heads [14, 15] (Fig. 5.4).

5.3
Lysogeny and Phage k
D’Herelle had noted that certain strains of bacteria appeared to be lysogenic for
bacteriophage (see Chap. 4). Bacterial cells were occasionally lysed by ‘‘carrier’’
phage, which were not always present in an infectious form. This was a puzzling
phenomenon that caused quite a bit of consternation and was behind the contro-
versy surrounding the discovery of phage and whether they were viruses or
autocatalytic molecules. The French scientist André Lwoff at the Pasteur Institute
decided to study this phenomenon [16]. He studied single bacterium (Bacillus
megatarium) in micro-drops of media under the microscope, watching for lysis and
the production of phage (by titration). Only occasionally did a bacterium lyse and
produce phage; one can imagine how tedious and bored he must have been. Thus
he hypothesized that certain bacteria carried within them an infectious entity that
was normally not replicated; this entity was termed a ‘‘prophage.’’ When lysogenic
bacteria were placed in culture, there was occasional lysis and production of
phage. Lwoff and others assumed this to be triggered by changes in the media by
bacterial products. What these factors were was never discovered.
After months of experimentation, it was decided to irradiate a bacterial culture
with UV radiation. This really did not make sense, since the bacteria themselves
would be sensitive to the UV irradiation. However, to Lwoff’s surprise (these
experiments were done with Siminovitch and Kjedgaard, both later eminent phage
Fig. 5.4 T4 phage assembly (www.cronodon.com with permission)
68

The Beginnings of Molecular Biology

geneticists), the culture lysed with the production of thousands of phages; thus,
lysogenic phage induction was discovered. A model was proposed in which the
phage DNA was repressed by a protein produced by the prophage; the UV irra-
diation destroyed this repressor (or converted it to an inducer), freeing the phage
DNA to replicate. The prophage was considered innocuous, but when induced, the
‘‘vegetative’’ phase of phage replication begins, and this leads to the destruction of
the host cell and production of thousands of viral particles. Lysogeny was used as a
model for developing theories of cancer formation by viruses (see Fig. 5.5).
While studying phage k in the 1950s, it was discovered that the phage picked up
a host gene (a gene for galactose metabolism, referred to as the ‘‘gal gene’’) and
transmitted it to gal-deﬁcient E. coli [17]. Further work indicated that the prophage
integrated into the bacterial chromosome near or next to the gal gene. When
induced, the phage existed independently and expressed this gene. Such a phage
was known as a ‘‘transducing phage.’’ Possible mechanisms were either the phage
genome synapses (pairs) to the bacterial chromosome and undergoes recombina-
tion, or, as proposed by Alan Campbell, the phage genome circularizes, and
recombines with the bacterial chromosome near the gal gene at a speciﬁc attach-
ment site. Upon being induced by UV light or spontaneously induced, the phage

occasionally incorporated nearby host genetic material, and in the process lost some
of its own genetic material [18, 19]. This transducing phage was replication
defective but could be rescued by wild type phage. Evidence from other research
using three genetic markers of lambda indicated that the phage genome was linear
in the phage head, but in a different order when integrated, and thus circular. Similar
studies done with T2 and T4 phages had also suggested a circular genome. In
bacterial strains in which the gal gene was deleted, the phage could transduce other
nearby genetic markers such as biotin, indicating that the lambda phage integrated
into a speciﬁc site [20]. Similar studies with another phage similar in structure to k,
called ‘‘phi 80,’’ indicated that this phage was able to transduce the gene for
tryptophan synthetase and integrate near the tryp gene [21]. Thus, not only did
lysogenic phage have the ability to circularize and integrate into the chromosome,
they had speciﬁc integration sites (att) and speciﬁc enzymes involved in recom-
bination, known as ‘‘integrase.’’ Lysogenic phages were under the control of a
repressor, which bound to regions of the phage chromosome and maintained it in
the lysogenic state. During experiments involving mating of two bacterial strains,
the integrated phage behaved like a bacterial gene, being transferred with the
bacterial chromosome—although depending on the strains used, it could be induced
to the lytic state during the process of mating. Each phage carrying the gal locus
was found to be different in buoyant density, indicating that different regions of the
phage genome were deleted and replaced with bacterial genetic material.
Using bacteriophages such as T2 and lambda, it was possible to dissect each
stage of virus replication, the role of nucleic acid, quantify the appearance of
mutation and mechanism of mutation, and develop a model from phage lambda for
gene repression and regulation. The number of scientists involved is too large to
list, but the main players all constituted the phage group headed by Max Delbruck,
that met at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. They were later joined by James
Watson and Francis Crick of DNA double helix fame.
Studies with bacteriophage led to a greater understanding of how cells regulate
protein synthesis, and to the recognition of what has been termed the ‘‘trinity of
molecular biology’’—namely, DNA–RNA–protein. In a landmark paper in 1961,
Sydney Brenner, François Jacob, and Matthew Messelson, using bacteriophage T4,
showed that infection with the phage led to cessation of host protein synthesis, that
phage protein synthesis occurred on organelles called ribosomes, and that there
was an RNA attached to such ribosomes, termed ‘‘messenger RNA [22] .’’ This
RNA was short lived and appeared to be involved in protein synthesis. Prior to
this, it was believed (or proposed) that the information for the protein was carried
by the ribosome itself: ‘‘one gene–one ribosome–one protein.’’ However, this
theory was already doubtful because of the homogeneity of the ribosomal popu-
lation. Jacob and Jacques Monod proposed that the ribosome was not the inter-
mediate, but played a role in the transfer of an unstable message (mRNA) copied
from the DNA that carried the instructions for the genetic information, and that
this ‘‘message’’ interacted with the ribosome. Transfer RNA carrying the respec-
tive amino acid would interact with the mRNA to form a protein on the ribosome.
Host and phage RNA could be distinguished using radioactive density, labeled

DNA and RNA. Host protein synthesis stopped a few minutes after infection, and
the new proteins being made were 60 % or more phage structural proteins. The
newly synthesized RNA was short lived and similar in sequence to phage DNA.
This RNA interacted with ribosomes to form polysomes, the machinery for protein
synthesis. From phage research the idea of mRNA was born, as well as the process
of transcription and translation of genetic material. Information is transferred from
the DNA by means of mRNA to protein [23] (Fig. 5.6).
Continuing studies with bacteriophage, particularly with the lysogenic phage k,
Mark Ptashne and others described the intricacies of gene regulation. This
developed from a study of k ‘‘immunity,’’ i.e., the maintenance of the phage in the
lysogenic state, the destruction of the repressor by UV treatment leading to
induction and replication of the phage [24, 25]. Looking back, it is surprising that
studies of a single bacteriophage such as this E. coli phage would result in dis-
coveries that were applicable to the whole ﬁeld of gene regulation and even
development in higher organisms. The idea of repressors acting on speciﬁc DNA
sequences known as operators developed from the work of Jacob and Monod with
gene regulation in bacteria in the 1960s. It was suggested that there were proteins
that interacted with sequences of a gene that either shut the gene down (repressed)
or were in turn modiﬁed and turned the gene on (activated). Mark Ptashne, as a
student at Harvard, used this model in studying lambda phage. In 1967 he

proposed that the phage was kept in its lysogenic state by a repressor that inter-
acted with a speciﬁc sequence of phage DNA (promoter region). This repressor
was made from a phage gene (C1), analogous to similar repressors hypothesized to
regulate certain bacterial genes (lac repressor). The repressor was identiﬁed by
using ts mutants of the phage; this repressor could also interact and prevent the
replication of other superinfecting phages of the same type by binding to the same
sequence of DNA. Lysis occurred when the repressor was destroyed and an
activator protein bound to a nearby promoter and started the lytic cycle (see
Fig. 5.7). This model, with variations, could be applied to any gene, and it gave

rise to the idea that gene regulation in general, including the various steps in
embryonic development, was controlled by repressor proteins and activator pro-
teins that bound to different regions of DNA. RNA transcription would be con-
trolled in the same fashion. This is of course a simpliﬁed representation, since we
now know that transcriptional regulation involves many proteins interacting with
each other at each promoter region, one or more of which binds to speciﬁc DNA
sequences.
5.4
The Oncogene Theory of Cancer
The discovery of lysogeny and transduction led to the development of models
explaining how animal viruses could cause tumors. This model was ﬁrst proposed by
Robert Huebner and George Todaro [26], two scientists working with Rous sarcoma
virus and other retroviruses and expanded upon by Gross, who worked with leu-
kemia viruses. At this time (the 1960s–1970s), it was believed that viruses were the
major cause of cancer. Earlier work (referred to in Chap. 1) had shown that viruses
could cause leukemia and solid tumors in chickens. In 1933 Shope discovered a
papilloma virus [27] that caused tumors in cottontail rabbits, and in 1936 John
Joseph Bittner identiﬁed a mouse mammary tumor virus [28]. In the 1960s, the
Epstein-Barr virus was associated with the human Burkitt’s lymphoma and other
viruses, such as polyoma virus, SV-40, adenovirus; adenovirus and papillomavirus
transformed cells in culture, indicating that they might be cancerous for humans. The
discovery of a series of retroviruses and the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an enzyme
that could copy RNA into DNA, reinforced the idea that viruses were the major
cause of human cancers. Viral transformed cells, when injected into mice or ham-
sters, nearly always developed into tumors. The oncogene theory proposed that all
cells carry genes that could be altered by environmental factors and turned into
cancer-causing genes; these genes were known as ‘‘proto-oncogenes’’ and the
cancerous form as ‘‘c-oncogenes.’’ When cells are infected with a tumor virus
(retrovirus), the oncogenes integrate into the chromosome by recombination, rep-
licates with the cell, and occasionally—if activated—a tumor develops. The virus
itself would be silent and not expressed, although the genetic material would be
present in all cells (see Chap. 8 on viruses and cancer). An adaptation of this theory,
proposed by Gross, was that the viruses involved were normal components of the
cell and such viruses would be transmitted vertically (from one generation to the
next at the cellular level and thus in individuals), and occasionally would cause a
tumor (or leukemia) as a result of some action of the viral promoter on an nearby
oncogene. Large numbers of cancer-causing retroviruses were discovered in rodents
and fowl (chickens) and most did carry an oncogene. As in the case of transducing
phages, the viruses were defective and had lost part of their genetic material with the
insertion of the proto-oncogene. With further research, the number of identiﬁed
oncogenes increased, as these are genes involved in transcriptional regulation, cell
growth and cell division (see http://www.cancerquest.org/oncogene-table.html).
5.3
Lysogeny and Phage k
73

Other tumor viruses, such as adenovirus, or SV-40, or polyoma, contained viral
genes that functioned to regulate cell growth, and thus acted in a fashion similar to
oncogenes. Such gene products interacted with host proteins, resulting in unlimited
growth and tumor formation. The type of tumor virus was categorized as either
fast, when the virus carried an oncogene, or slow, as in the case of viruses causing
leukemia, where the virus integrated into a site close to a proto-oncogene and acted
on this gene, usurping its normal regulation.
Although this model is correct and has held up for experimental tumors in
rodents, most human tumors are not caused by oncogenic viruses (see Chap. 8).

The History of Immunology
Abstract
Immunology begins with Edward Jenner’s discovery that vaccination with
cowpox protects against smallpox. That there was an immune response was
conﬁrmed by the observations of many scientists that the same disease did not
return a second time to a recovered individual. With the recognition by
Friedrich Henle that germs caused disease, and the isolation of infectious
bacteria by his pupil Robert Koch, the stage was set to examine how an immune
response was achieved. Modern immunology begins with the research of
Metchnikoff, who discovered the phenomenon of phagocytosis in starﬁsh and
extrapolated it to macrophages in humans as cells that engulf infectious agents;
this was the beginning of cellular immunology. Paul Ehrlich investigated the
formation of antibodies recognized as later as proteins that destroyed infectious
agents. However, an explanation of how antibodies were formed and selected
was puzzling. Did the body have enough genes to code for every type of
antibody, and did speciﬁc cells produce antibodies, or did each cell have the
ability to produce antibodies to any challenging molecule? Following the work
of Karl Landsteiner, Felix Haurowitz, Niels Jerne and others, the ‘‘clonal
selection theory’’ was proposed by MacFarlane Burnett. This theory states that
each B-cell produces one type of antibody, and once activated, it expands and
produces memory cells. Meanwhile, work on cellular immunity and innate
immunity recognized the role of various types of T-cells, dendritic cells and
cytokines in the immune response. New classes of T-cells and cytokines are
constantly being found, and there is an intricate connection between these three
branches of the immune system.

6.1
What Is Immunology?
Since the aim of a pathogenic virus or bacteria is to requisition the body com-
pletely for the replication of itself, why does one not always die from infection? In
the course of millions of years of evolution, defense mechanisms arose to over-
whelm such pathogenic attacks. One can view this as a constant struggle between
pathogen and host, so that eventually a ‘‘truce’’ is achieved in which both co-exist
(lysogeny in bacteria or chronic disease in mammals) or one (the host) vanquishes
the invading pathogen or the pathogen is triumphant and kills the host. All
organisms, from the most primitive bacterium, to plants to man, developed
defenses against invasion and infection. In bacteria, this system is referred to as
‘‘restriction’’, since enzymes (restriction enzymes) are produced that destroy the
DNA of an invading bacteriophage, or the genetic material of an invading foreign
bacterium. Likewise, plants have developed primitive immune systems to protect
themselves against both viral and bacterial pathogens, the result of convergent
evolution rather than descent from a common ancestor. Plants, however, lack
specialized mobile immune cells as occurs in animals [1]; instead, every plant cell
is thought to be capable of launching an effective immune response. Somewhere
along the time scale of evolution, vertebrates have developed a two-tier system,
one a general immediate action against a foreign invader—the innate immune
system, the other a delayed response, but a very speciﬁc reaction against the
invader—the adaptive immune response. This consists of two components, plasma
cells and antibodies, and a complex cellular system of ‘‘immune’’ cells that interact
with antibody-producing cells.
In order to understand the complexities of immunology, and it is indeed very
complex, and to gain a better insight into the theories and progress made over the
last 150 years or so, it is worth considering the progress made in this science in
chronological order.
6.2
Henle’s Contribution to Immunology
As discussed in Chap. 1, Friedrich Gustave Jakob Henle (1809–1885) proposed the
germ theory of disease around 1840. Henle was a major ﬁgure in both medicine
and anatomy. In 1852–1873 he published a Handbook of Systematic Human
Anatomy, which at that time was the most complete and comprehensive text of its
kind. It was remarkable not only for its anatomical descriptions, but also for the
number and quality of its illustrations. Henle wrote, ‘‘I have shown, then, that the
infective material must be independently alive, and thought to consist of organ-
isms—either plant or animal—or of parts of animals which have achieved a
limited independence’’. (Pathologische Untersuchungen). Henle was a very col-
orful character, typical of the Enlightenment, born into a Jewish family in Fürth,

Germany, interested in music and the arts as well as medicine. Among his circle of
friends was the composer Felix Mendelssohn. Henle was a superb lecturer, a poet
and a ﬁne musician, playing the violin, viola and cello Fig. 6.1. He was very close
to his most famous student, Robert Koch, who later on was to provide deﬁnitive
proof of Henle‘s belief in infectious agents as independent organisms.
6.3
Metchnikoff and Ehrlich
Modern immunology begins with the research of Emil Metchnikoff (1845–1910), a
Russian microbiologist and embryologist who recognized the importance of
phagocytosis as a general biological phenomenon. He was a professor at Odessa
University, but later established a private laboratory in Messina, Italy, to study
comparative embryology, in particular of marine organisms. Tauber and Chernyak
[2] he demonstrated, analogous to his work with invertebrates, that certain cells of
the blood also digested (phagocytized) bacterial particles. Eminent scientists such

as Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) and Emil Von Behring (1854–1917) were very
skeptical at the time.
In 1888 Pasteur invited him to the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where he spent the
remainder of his life. Of importance are his drawings of cells that he called
‘‘macrophages’’, taking up foreign particles, and showed that these cells were
important in the clearance of disease. He proposed that such cells were the ﬁrst line
of defense against infection by a bacterium rather than soluble factors (antibodies),
as proposed by Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915) and others. He became a leading pro-
ponent of the ‘‘cellularists’’, who believed that phagocytes, rather than antibodies,
played the leading role in immunity. It is now thought that many of the cells
described by Metchnikoff were actually dendritic cells rather than macrophages
(see Figs. 6.2, 6.3). Metchnikoff received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1908,
sharing it with Ehrlich. Of course both Metchnikoff and Ehrlich were correct, and
each system depends on the other.
The humoral (antibody-mediated) theory of immunity really begins with the
experiments of Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1853–1931) with
diphtheria and tetanus toxin. Diphtheria was rampant during the end of the
nineteenth century, with a high rate of fatality, and tetanus occurred predomi-
nantly in the military. Von Behring and Kitasato showed that it was possible to
passage the diphtheria toxin through horses (or other animals) and obtain serum-
containing anti-toxin. This serum, when injected into other animals, protected
them against the diphtheria toxin. In his Nobel Prize address in 1901, Von
Behring equated his serum therapy with the presence of antibodies formed
against diphtheria toxin. Certainly unknown at the time was the fact that diph-
theria toxin was actually a viral (bacteriophage) product and not a direct product
of the bacillus.
Building on the results of the research on diphtheria toxins, Erhlich proposed
that speciﬁc cells produced antibodies. According to Ehrlich’s side-chain theory,
immune cells were dotted with a vast array of receptors, each speciﬁc to a par-
ticular substance (Fig. 6.4). When an antigen interacted with the relevant receptor,
the cell would be activated and would react by producing more receptors, which
would then be released into the bloodstream as antibodies to neutralize the toxin.
This hypothesis, and other research including developing treatment against
syphilis and techniques for the staining of various types of blood cells, earned
Ehrlich a Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1908. His side-chain antibody theory was
later discredited, although it did form the basis for other theories of antibody
formation. Ehrlich also proposed the idea of ‘‘self versus non-self’’ as a charac-
teristic of the immune system.
In summary, Metchnikoff proposed a cellular basis for the immune response,
whereas Ehrlich proposed a humoral response. Until the 1940s, the antibody
theory of the immune response was dominant. By 1915, Ehrlich’s side-chain
theory had been largely rejected, in part because it stipulated that every cell
expressed all of the receptors it might need to neutralize toxins or bacteria or virus.

Development of Antibody Theory and Structure
Michael Heidelberger (1888–1991) is considered the ‘‘father of American
immunology’’ (or immune-chemistry). His background, although he was born in
the USA, is similar to that of Ehrlich and Henle. He came from a relatively poor
family, but one in which there was an emphasis on education. He was also
interested in music, and considered it as a possible career, and he even performed
with an active trio. Following his education and post-doctoral studies in Germany,
he was offered a position at the Rockefeller Institute in Simon Flexner’s group,
which was working on polio virus. At the same time, Karl Landsteiner

The History of Immunology

(1868–1943) had been working in Germany and discovered the ABO blood
groupings and isolated the polio virus from rhesus monkeys. In 1921 he was also
invited by Flexner to join the Rockefeller Institute in New York. When Karl
Landsteiner left Vienna in 1922 at the age of 54 for the Rockefeller Institute, he
had already done much of his most important work. In the early years of the
century he had discovered a simple technique of agglutination, whereby human
blood was divided into four groups, a discovery that made safe blood transfusions
possible. This work in turn led him to the study of hereditary differences in the
antigens of blood groups, and thus to the birth of serological genetics. A succes-
sion of discoveries followed in the 1920s and 1930s, after he had moved to the
Rockefeller Institute: the discovery of blood factors (M, N, P, and Rh factors), and
investigations of the chemical speciﬁcity of serological reactions, which became a
basis of immunochemistry. Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physi-
ology or Medicine in 1930 (biographical data on Karl Landsteiner from the
American Philosophical Society http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/
Mss.B.L23m-ead.xml).
Heidelberger collaborated with Landsteiner on studies of the antigenic prop-
erties of different types of hemoglobin. Throughout his life, Heidelberger was
proud to say that he ﬁrst learned immunology from Landsteiner. He researched the
structure of pneumococcal antigens and the antibodies they elicited. In the 1920s,
Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery (1877–1955) observed that antigens
could be precipitated by antibodies, and they went on to show that antibodies were
made of protein [3, 4].
The chemistry of antigen-antibody reactions was uncovered largely by the
development of the quantitative precipitin reactions between antibody and anti-
gen in collaboration between Heidelberger and Elvin Kabat (1914–2000), his
graduate student. Kabat [5] later was instrumental in the discovery of the
structural and genetic basis of the remarkable speciﬁcity of antibodies. He ﬁrst
demonstrated that antibodies are gamma globulins, and he characterized the size
and stunning heterogeneity of antibody-combining sites [6]. The heterogeneity
extended over the whole length of the antibody molecule. These were in both the
heavy and light chain and extended to genetic markers. There were multiple
types of antibodies, derived from ﬁve different classes of human immunoglob-
ulin. The question was how to explain this variability at the genetic level. The
structure of a typical antibody is presented in Fig. 6.5. Each antibody is made up
of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains, shaped to form a
‘‘Y’’. The sections that make up the tips of the Ys’ arms vary greatly from one
antibody to another; this is called the ‘‘variable region’’. It is the amino-acid
sequence in the antigen-binding site that allows the antibody to recognize an
antigen. The constant region is the same for all antibodies of the same type of
immunoglobulin.

6.5
The Clonal Theory of Antibody Production
The large variety of antibodies formed, and the fact that T-cells, which will be
discussed later, can also recognize any antigen, has led to multiple hypotheses on
how such diversity arose. From the knowledge of genetics at that time, it seemed
inconceivable that there should be genes for the production of each type of
antibody; this would require many more genes than we possess. Since antibodies
are formed in response to infection, and take some time for processing (a
minimum of 5 days), there has to be a mechanism for selection. Are they pre-
formed and ﬂoating around in our blood, or are they formed anew each time we
are infected? Immunologists were preoccupied with these conﬂicting ideas for a
long time.
Landsteiner [7] showed that antibodies were not produced against the whole
bacterium or infecting agent, but against small regions of this agent, the ‘‘deter-
minant group’’, a short polypeptide that we now call ‘‘epitope’’. Initially he sug-
gested that antigens might act as mutagens, altering the cell in some fashion to
produce more antibodies that react with the speciﬁc antigen. Other hypotheses
were based on the idea of a template in which the antigen entered the antibody-
producing cell and directed the formation of the antibody. This theory assumes that
antibodies can be produced only by cells in which the antigen is present. This

The History of Immunology

theory is known as the ‘‘antigen-template theory.’’ The speciﬁc afﬁnity of an
antibody molecule toward the antigen is due to complementarity in sequence of
amino acids. The antigen thus serves as a template for the formation of the anti-
body. These ideas were presented and discussed by renowned immunologists such
as Felix Haurowitz (1896–1987), Niels Jerne (1911–1994), and Linus Pauling
(1901–1994). A genetic mechanism for this could not be found.
The 1950s were a period of intellectual ferment in immunology. How can we
explain the large number of antibodies that are produced to ‘‘everything’’ that
infects us? MacFarlane Burnett (1899–1954) and Frank Fenner (1914–2010) [8, 9]
proposed an alternate hypothesis known as the ‘‘modiﬁed enzyme’’ hypothesis.
They proposed that the introduction of an antigen into cells containing enzymes
that normally degraded foreign material induced the formation of ‘‘enzymic units’’
programmed to destroy the antigen. Renewed contact with the antigen stimulates
the replication of these ‘‘enzymic units’’, thus explaining memory in antibody
production. Circulating antibodies are partial replicas of the modiﬁed enzymic
units, carrying speciﬁcity but lacking enzymic action.
Jerne [10] proposed that the body already has the antibodies, made in spe-
cialized cells, that it needs to ﬁght any infection. The interaction of the antibody
with the antigen results in the stimulation of more antibodies. This was called the
‘‘natural selection hypothesis’’. Jerne rejected the idea that the antigen is a tem-
plate or an enzyme modiﬁer. He proposed that globulin molecules are being
synthesized in a large number of different shapes and structures and that these
interact with the antigens. This interaction in turn stimulated the production of
more antibodies. This would explain the fact that antibodies can be found in the
circulation after an infection is over. Such alternate antibodies would also be able
to shut down the production of antibodies and that antibodies against self would be
eliminated in the organ where antibodies mature. The selection theory was later
advanced to include not only antibodies, but also T-cell receptors that recognized
foreign antigens.
An alternative hypothesis, based on the ideas of Jerne, was the ‘‘clonal
selection hypothesis’’. This proposes that antigens react with sequences on the
surface of antibody producing cells (or later expanded to T-cells with their unique
receptors), and this interaction leads to expansion of these speciﬁc antibody
producing B-cells (plasma cells) and T-cells. This interaction between the antigen
and the receptor results in the clonal expansion of such cells. Since there are
obviously thousands of different types of antibodies, these result from random
recombination within segments of the immunoglobulin genes, which gives rise to
thousands of different antigen-receptor structures. The mechanism at the gene
level was discovered much later. Thus the process of antibody formation is
basically a random process, akin to Darwinian selection. This is now the accepted
theory for explaining the diversity of antibodies and T-cell receptors (see
Fig. 6.6).
6.5
The Clonal Theory of Antibody Production
85

To summarize the clonal selection theory:
1. Animals contain numerous cells called lymphocytes.
2. Each lymphocyte is responsive to a particular antigen by virtue of a speciﬁc
surface receptor molecule.
3. Upon contacting its appropriate antigen, the lymphocyte is stimulated to pro-
liferate (clonal expansion) and differentiate.
Fig. 6.6 Clonal selection with two different antigens. The clonal selection theory of
lymphocytes. Schematic of clonal selection hypothesis of antibody production by lymphocytes,
illustrating the idea that each naïve lymphocyte has a different receptor speciﬁcity, each of which
can bind a different antigenic determinant. When a pathogen is recognized by the cells, in this
case by two different antigenic determinants, then the cells that bind to these determinants are
selected to proliferate or undergo clonal expansion, and then differentiate into effector cells that
either secrete antibodies or mediate various effector mechanisms of cell-mediated immunity [11]

4. The expanded clone is responsible for the secondary response (more cells
to respond), while the differentiated (‘‘effector’’) cells secrete antibody or
antibodies.
5. A small number of cells remain to form memory cells.
See excellent review of this history [12].
6.6
Genetic Basis of Antibody Formation
There are hundreds of genes for immunoglobulins, the proteins that give rise to
antibodies. If each antibody were coded for by a separate gene, one would need
millions of such genes. Instead, the DNA for such genes is reorganized by splicing
mechanisms and by recombination by enzymes known as recombinases. All cells
of the same clonal origin produce the same antibody and have identical rear-
rangements. Each gene contains exons, the parts that code for proteins, and introns,
non-coding components; such introns are removed by a splicing mechanism. This
splicing mechanism is not unique to immunoglobulin genes, but to almost all
genes. In the case of immunoglobulin, each exon would code for a different region
of the antibody; some regions code for the variable region, while others code for
the constant region. Each immunoglobulin (antibody) has a constant region and
variable region coded for by different chromosomes.
There are four key antigen receptors: the T-cell, MHC-1, MHC-II and B-cell
receptor. The antigen interacts with the variable domain of the protein, which will
differ from cell to cell. A typical receptor gene is shown in Fig. 6.7.
6.7
Cell-Based Immunity
While major studies in immunology during the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century
were predominantly on elucidating the structure of antibodies and how and where
they are made, research on humoral immunity, abandoned for some time, picked
up speed in the second half of the century. The early work on cellular immunity
really derives from transplantation experiments of grafting tissue or tumors from
one mouse to another. Grafts between inbred strains of mice were accepted,
whereas those between non-inbred strains or different genetic strains were not
accepted. This resulted in studies of self versus non-self in tissue transplants. The
work of George Snell (1903–1996) and colleagues [13] illustrated two principles:
First, tissue rejection depends on genetic differences between donor and host.
Second, the processes involved in tissue rejection are immunological in nature,
and speciﬁc genes are involved in the rejection process. In humans, when an organ
is transferred from one patient to another, this will be rejected if the immune
system detects it as ‘‘non-self’’. Recognition depended on speciﬁc genes later
called ‘‘major histocompatibility genes’’ (MHC). An MHC protein serves as a
6.5

recognizable scaffold that presents peptides of a foreign protein (antigenic) to
immune cells. An empty ‘‘foreign’’ MHC scaffold itself can act as an antigen when
donor organs or cells are introduced into a patient’s body. These MHC self-marker
scaffolds are also known as a patient’s ‘‘tissue type’’, or as human leukocyte
antigens (HLA) when a patient’s white blood cells are being characterized. (See
http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/immunesystem/page4.)
Every cell in the human body is covered with these MHC self-marker proteins,
and—except for identical twins—individuals carry different sets. MHC marker
proteins are as distinct as blood types and come in two categories–MHC Class I:
humans bear 6 markers out of 200 possible variations; and MHC Class II: humans
display 8 out of about 230 possibilities (NCI Web site). All lymphocytes carry
either MHC1 or MHCII proteins on their surfaces. The MHC I complex occurs in

The History of Immunology

all nucleated cells, whereas type II occurs in dendritic cells, macrophages, B-
lymphocytes and cells of the thymus.
The role that the MHC loci played in immunology was further explored by
studying the role of T lymphocytes (T-cells) in the immune response to viral
meningitis. Virus-infected mouse cells were mixed with T-lymphocytes from
infected mice of various strains. T-lymphocytes did destroy the virus-infected
cells, but only if the infected cells and the lymphocytes came from a genetically
identical strain of mice. Lymphocytes would ignore virus-infected cells that had
been taken from another strain of mice; [14] thus MHC proteins were strain-
speciﬁc and involved in T-cell recognition.
The deﬁnitive proof that cells played a role in the immune response came from
the classic experiments of Landsteiner and Merrill Chase (1905–2004). Cells from
guinea pigs, which had been immunized with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or
hapten, were transferred into naive guinea pigs. (A hapten is a small molecule that
can elicit an immune response only when attached to a large carrier such as a
protein.) When an antigen or hapten was injected into these naïve guinea pigs, they
elicited an immune response. This did not happen when the serum fraction alone
was transferred [15–18]. Thus the immune response required both a cellular
fraction as well as a serum fraction. The need for both cell-mediated and antibody-
mediated immunity had been established by 1940; however, the type of cells
involved was still unknown.
The ﬁndings that there are two classes (or many classes) of lymphocytes came
from an unexpected source. Bursectomy—the removal of the bursa from the ‘‘tail’’
of an adult chicken—had no noticeable morphologic or functional effects on the
immune system. Bursectomy before or immediately after hatching produced major
immunological impairments in the chick: speciﬁc antibody responses were abol-
ished, serum antibody levels were very low, and plasma cells and germinal centers
for the production of antibodies were absent. The rejection of foreign grafts,
however, was normal. Thymectomy (removal of the thymus) had the opposite
results; in both chicks and mice it impaired the host versus graft reaction as well as
decreasing antibody production [19]. These experiments pointed to two types of
lymphocytes, those derived from the bursa, coined ‘‘B-lymphocytes’’, and those
from the thymus, coined ‘‘T-lymphocytes’’. Since man does not have a bursa, the
B-cells are produced elsewhere [20]. A series of experiments [21–25] demon-
strated that antibody-producing cells in man were made in the bone marrow and
stored in the spleen, and that for full antibody production one required cells from
the thymus, now termed T-cells and also macrophages. Thus T-cells were involved
in two activities: one in helping antibody production and the other in the graft-host
reaction.
By the 1970s it became clear that there were at least two classes of T-lym-
phocytes. These could be distinguished by antibodies made to surface antigens
known as ‘‘CD antigens’’ (clusters of differentiation) in humans, or Ly antigens
(lymphocytes) in mice. T-cells could be divided into helper T-cells, i.e., those that
were involved in ‘‘helping’’ antibody production and ‘‘cytotoxic’’ or ‘‘killer
T-cells’’ that were involved in the tissue-rejection phenomenon.
6.7
Cell-Based Immunity
89

It was originally thought that T-cell receptors would also be immunoglobulin
molecules, but this proved to be wrong. In 1983 Philippa Marrack and colleagues
[26] showed that the receptor consisted of two polypeptide chains of *45 KDa,
with both constant and variable regions, and was similar, but not identical, to
immunoglobulin. A year later, cDNAs for the T-cell receptor were cloned and the
gene was organized in a similar manner to the antibody gene. The T-cell receptor,
unlike the B-cell receptor, only binds protein antigens and does not bind antigens
directly, but only after the antigen has been internalized by other cell types and
re-expressed on the cell surface in association with MHC molecules; such cells are
known as ‘‘antigen-presenting cells’’ [27].
In summary, the inter-relationship between adaptive and innate immunity as
deﬁned in the 1970s and 1980s is presented in Fig. 6.8. When an antigen enters the
mammalian body, there is an instant reaction with the mobilization of dendritic
cells, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. Macrophages present virus
antigens on the cell surface and activate T-c cells. This is done in conjunction with
cytokines produced by the macrophage. NK cells are activated by interferons and
also destroy virus-infected cells. Interferon plays a major role in the activation of
the ﬁrst line of defense; this is described in Chap. 7.
B-cells recognize antigens and expand with the help of Th cells, resulting in
plasma cell formation and soluble antibody production. Th cells and Tc cells
expand, and Tc cells destroy cells that contain viruses.
This is a very simpliﬁed presentation, and we now recognize that many different
cytokines and many sub-sets of T-cells are involved in the immune response.
Fig. 6.9
6.8
T-helper Cells
T-cells are now divided into a number of different classes, based on CD identi-
ﬁcation and different functions. New classes are being discovered continuously.
T-h or T-helper cells, also known as CD-4 cells, help with the maturation
of B-cells into plasma cells, which produce antibodies and also mature into
B-memory cells. T-helper cells can also activate T-cytotoxic cells and macro-
phages. Helper T-cells become activated when they are presented with peptide
antigens in the presence of MHC class II molecules, expressed on the surface of
antigen-presenting cells. These cells can differentiate into different types of
T-cells, including TH1, TH2, TH3, TH17, Th9, or TFH. The classiﬁcation of
T-cells depends on the type of cytokines they produce. Proliferating helper T-
cells that develop into effector T-cells differentiate into two major subtypes of
cells known as Th1 and Th2 cells. Th1 helper cells are triggered by the cytokines
IL12 and IL2 and produce as activator IFN-gamma. The main effector cells of
Th1 immunity are macrophages, CD8 cells, and IFN-gamma producing CD4
cells and B-cells. Th2 helper cells are the major effectors against multicellular

parasites. They are triggered by IL-4, and their effector cytokines are IL-4, IL-5,
and IL-13.
Figure 6.10 presents a schematic of the differentiation into Th1 and Th2 cells
and their functions, as does Table 6.1. T helper cells type 1 (Th1s) that produce
predominantly interferon-c mediate cellular immune responses and are involved in
the development of chronic inﬂammatory conditions, whereas Th2s, which pro-
duce large amounts of IL-4 and IL-5, up-regulate IgE production and are promi-
nent in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. The precise factors determining
whether Th1- or Th2-mediated immune responses preferentially occur at a
peripheral site of antigen exposure are largely unknown. Chemokines, a

superfamily of polypeptide mediators, are a key component in the leukocyte
recruitment process [28].
TH3 cells are involved in mucosal immunity and protecting mucosal surfaces in
the gut from nonpathogenic, non-self antigens. They mediate this non-inﬂamma-
tory environment by secreting TGF-beta and IL-10 (Fig. 6.11).
Since all these cells contain CD4, CXCR4 and CXCR5 and are thus susceptible
to HIV infection, the balance of immune cells is altered following HIV infection.
A recent paper suggests that HIV infection may drive the T-helper cell population
towards T-reg cells, thus suppressing the function of other T-cells [29].
6.9
Complement Cascade
This is a system in which antibody antigen complexes are destroyed by interaction
with speciﬁc proteins of the ‘‘complement cascade’’. It is mostly functional against
bacteria, and is not a predominant anti-viral system. The complement system is

Other functions
The Type 1 cytokine IFN-c increases the production of interleukin-
12 by dendritic cells and macrophages, and via positive feedback,
IL-12 stimulates the production of IFN-c in helper T-cells, thereby
promoting the Th1 proﬁle. IFN-gamma also inhibits the production
of cytokines such as interleukin-4, an important cytokine
associated with the Type 2 response, and thus it also acts to
preserve its own response
The Type 2 response promotes its own proﬁle using two different
cytokines. Interleukin-4 acts on helper T-cells to promote the
production of Th2 cytokines (including itself; it is auto-regulatory),
while interleukin-10 (IL-10) inhibits a variety of cytokines
including interleukin-2 and IFN-c in helper T-cells and IL-12 in
dendritic cells and macrophages. The combined action of these two
cytokines suggests that once the T-cell has decided to produce
these cytokines, that decision is preserved (and also encourages
other T-cells to do the same)

made up of about 25 proteins that aid in the destruction of bacteria tagged by
antibodies. The complement proteins circulate in the blood in an inactive form,
with each component taking its turn in a precise chain of steps known as the
complement cascade. There are at least three different cascades that inactivate the
invading bacterium by puncturing holes in the cell wall. The complement cascade
may play a role in speciﬁc virus infections such as in measles and retroviruses.
However, compared to interferon and cytokines, its role in anti-viral innate
response is minimal.
6.10
Skin as a Component of the Immune System
A major line of defense against all infections is the skin of an animal or human.
We have become so preoccupied with deﬁning the functions of the various cells in
the immune response that we are inclined to forget the role that this organ plays in
defense. The ﬁrst lines of defense against infection are the external ‘‘organs’’ of the
body, which include the skin, tears produced by the eye, and cilia of the ears, nose
and bronchi. Mucus in other parts of the body may have antimicrobial activity. A
lower temperature in the nose, and low physiological pH in the gut (acidity) all act
as deterrents to infection. That the skin is in fact an active component of the
immune system has recently been demonstrated by the use of patches to elicit an
immune response against anthrax and other infectious agents, by introducing genes
from such organisms into Escherichia coli and applying the recombinant E. coli
directly to the skin [30, 31] (see Fig. 6.12).
Fig. 6.11 Th17 cells are so called because they produce IL17. They appear to be involved in the
autoimmune response. T regulatory cells (Treg) are a component of the immune system that
suppresses immune responses of other cells. This is an important ‘‘self-check’’ built into the
immune system to prevent excessive reactions (Wikipedia [33])
6.9
Complement Cascade
95

When the skin is broken by a cut or wound, it then becomes a site of entry for
viruses or bacteria. Cases of HIV and HCV have been reported by physicians after
an accidental cut or mistaken injection with contaminated blood. HIV in particular
enters through wounds in the skin or any of the membranes of the genital tract or
anus; a herpes infection causing genital wounds is also a site of entry for other
viruses.
6.11
Toll-Like Receptors and Pattern Recognition
Once the virus penetrates the skin or mucous membrane, it attaches to cells with
speciﬁc receptors. Within the cell there has to be a signaling system for recognition
of a pathogen or foreign agent. Recently, components of the cell, known as ‘‘toll-
like receptors‘‘, which are either membrane-bound or cytoplasmic and recognize
pathogens or components of pathogens such as the double-stranded RNA of a
virus, have been discovered and induce the production of cytokines and interferons
to counteract the invader. There are many different toll-like receptors; some are
speciﬁc for viral RNA, others for bacterial surface proteins, lipids, toxins, etc.;
these are also known as pathogen-recognition receptors. The component of the
virus that is recognized by such molecules is called the pathogen-associated
molecular pattern. There is a whole series of pattern recognition receptors
(Table 6.2).

The History of Immunology

The results of activation of the toll-like receptors is complicated and involves
the activation of a series of kinases, enzymes that phosphorylate other enzymes,
and activate them. The end result is the production of a cascade of intermediate
molecules that in turn interact with signals on DNA and produce interferon and
other cytokines. (This is discussed in part in the chapter on interferon, Chap. 7.)
There are as many as 80 known cytokines, and these control the innate immune
response.

Interferons
Abstract
Interferon was discovered by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann in 1957. It was
originally thought that interferon could be used as a general anti-viral agent and
in anti-cancer therapy. There are many different types of interferons, now
known as interferons ‘‘alpha,’’ ‘‘beta,’’ ‘‘gamma’’ and ‘‘lambda,’’ with different
cellular receptors and modes of action, and there are possibly 24 different types
of alpha interferon. Independently and simultaneously, a group of Japanese
scientists found an ‘‘interfering factor,’’ which upon subsequent analysis turned
out to be interferon, probably of the alpha type. The interferon alpha gene was
the ﬁrst mammalian gene to be cloned in a bacterial system and became the
prototype for gene cloning technology. Until the cloning of the interferons in
Escherichia coli, and expression of the interferon genes in mammalian cells in
culture, it was impossible to obtain enough material for clinical use. Interferon
today is predominantly used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C, leukemia and
Kaposi’s sarcoma. As an anti-viral agent, interferon has not lived up to its initial
promise, since in vitro most viruses block the activity of interferon and clinical
trials have given inconclusive results with severe side effects. Interferon
induces hundreds of genes in vivo and in vitro, each interferon producing
overlapping and distinct gene proﬁles. The mechanism of both interferon
induction and anti-viral response is complicated and involves the interaction of
many regulatory molecules. Interferon is now known to be a component of the
large family of cytokines or interleukins.

Discovery of Interferon
No history of virology would be complete without a discussion of interferons and
how they led to the discovery and identiﬁcation of cytokines (small proteins that
inﬂuence the activity of the immune system and nearby cells), their function in
innate immunity, and their pharmaceutical properties as anti-viral and anti-cancer
agents. The cloning of the interferon gene and its production in E. coli initiated the
biotechnology revolution. As was the case of many other major discoveries in
science, interferon was a fortuitous discovery.
In 1957, Alick Isaacs (1921–1965) and a post-doctoral Swiss student, Jean
Lindenmann, were studying the phenomenon of ‘‘viral interference’’—the ability
of one virus to inhibit the replication of another virus. When 10-day-old chick
chorioallontoic membranes from chick embryos were infected with heat or UV
inactivated inﬂuenza virus, a material was produced that interfered with sub-
sequent viral replication. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Fig. 7.1.
Inﬂuenza virus production (or inhibition) was measured by hemagglutination, the
ability of the virus to interact and agglutinate red blood cells. They termed the
interfering substance ‘‘interferon’’.The end point of the titration was the identiﬁ-
cation of that well (on a plate of small wells) with partial agglutination; the
reciprocal of the inﬂuenza dilution thus observed was taken as the interferon titer
(concentration).
The ﬁrst reports of interferon were published in 1957 in the prestigious Pro-
ceedings of the Royal Society, [1, 2] and a more detailed description in the British
Journal of Pathology [3]. Using standard biochemical techniques, it was shown

that interferon was a protein, was pH 2 resistant, could be precipitated by
ammonium sulfate, destroyed by ether, and digested by trypsin—all characteristics
of proteins. The stability at pH 2 was an important characteristic, later used to
distinguish the original interferon (called IFN-alpha) from other later discovered
interferons. Attempts to initially purify the interferon were unsuccessful. A very
low concentration was induced and the investigators at that time were unaware that
multiple types of interferon existed, so that even with the techniques of column
chromatography available at that time, it proved impossible to purify a single type.
Jean Lindenmann returned to Zurich and did not continue to work on interferon
but continued research on inﬂuenza virus, discovering a strain of mice resistant to
the virus. This resistance did not appear to be related to interferon, but to the Mx
protein coded by an autosomal gene, MX. However, in later years Lindenmann and
colleagues found that the Mx protein was interferon-inducible, and that this protein
was a component of the cascade of genes induced by interferon.
Rather surprisingly, interferon was not viral-speciﬁc; it not only inhibited
inﬂuenza, the inducing virus, but also unrelated vaccinia and other viruses [4].
That interferon was an agent with a very wide inhibitory range suggested that
interferon could be used as a general anti-viral agent, much as the recently dis-
covered antibiotics. As a result, three pharmaceutical companies, Glaxo Labora-
tories, ICI Pharmaceuticals, and Burroughs Wellcome (later to become the
Wellcome Foundation) supported the research. The primary purpose was to pro-
duce enough interferon for use in clinical trials, and a second was to keep the
patent for interferon production in the U.K., since there was the feeling that
penicillin, a British discovery, had been appropriated by the U.S. (See Burke [5]
for a review of the early days of interferon research.)
7.2
Inhibitory Factor
In parallel with the research described above, but quite independently, in 1954 a
group of researchers in Japan characterized what they called a ‘‘virus inhibitory
factor’’ [6]. They injected ultra-violet irradiated vaccinia (inactivated virus) into
the backs of rabbits and subsequently inoculated them with live vaccinia at various
times after the initial inoculation. The vaccinia replication was inhibited by the
pre-treatment with the inactivated virus. They isolated this substance and called it
‘‘inhibitory factor’’ (IF). Further experimentation was difﬁcult because of the
system used. These observations were presented at the 1956 Annual Meeting of the
Japan Society for Viral Research and later at the meeting of the Japan-France
Biology Society held in 1957. This was really the ﬁrst report on interferon but was
not recognized as such until much later. The IF was later tested for interferon
activity using rabbit standard interferon, designated as such by the International
Committee on Interferons, and it was found to have an interferon titer of
300,000 IU, an astonishingly high level of activity. It is now clear that Yasuichi
Nagano and Yasuhiko Kojima observed the production of interferon in response to

an inactivated DNA virus in the whole animal. Because this work was carried out
in Japan, and originally published in a French journal, it was not given the rec-
ognition it deserved. (A fuller description of this study can be found in the review
by Ozato and colleagues [7].)
7.3
First Clinical Trials
An ambitious ﬁrst ‘‘clinical trial’’ was performed at the Salisbury Common Cold
Center in England in 1962. Its purpose was to examine whether interferon
inhibited the production of vaccinia virus following injection of the virus into the
arms of individuals who had not been previously vaccinated with vaccinia. The
result was limited inhibition of vaccinia replication; it was also obvious that much
more interferon was needed if it was to be of clinical value, but it was not until the
1980s that enough interferon could be produced in a pure state for this purpose.
Prior to gene cloning, it was extremely difﬁcult to produce enough interferon for
clinical use, even when attempting to produce it in cells in culture. In the 1960s
there was a large demand for interferon in order to test it as an anti-cancer drug.
Kari Cantell in Finland produced leukocyte interferon, in large vats, in quantities
sufﬁcient for some limited clinical trials. He harvested leukocytes from many
sources and infected them with the Sendai virus, which greatly stimulated the
production of interferon. However, even with these facilities, it was impossible to
produce quantities sufﬁcient for all the desired clinical trials (Fig. 7.2).

How Does Interferon Protect Cells Against Virus
Infection?
During the 1960s, many different viruses were shown to induce interferon in cell
culture, and interferon in turn—when added to cells in culture—could inhibit most
viruses, particularly at high concentrations, but not all, since it was realized much
later that some viruses had developed methods of neutralizing interferon activity.
Interferon was measured by its anti-viral activity, one unit of interferon being
sufﬁcient to inhibit viral growth by 50 %, usually measured by a plaque assay.
Since there was some variability depending on the cell line and virus used, stan-
dard lots were titered or measured the NIH and supplied as ‘‘standards’’ to labo-
ratories on request. When interferon was added directly to virus, there was no
effect; it was the addition of interferon to the cells that inhibited virus production.
A virus-infected cell produces interferon, which protects nearby cells; thus. the
nearby cells are in an anti-viral state. (This is illustrated in Fig. 7.3).
Interferons are not only induced by viruses, but by viral intermediates such as
double-stranded RNA, by synthetic double-stranded RNA such as PolyI:PolyC,
some species of bacteria, endotoxins, and other cytokines. By the 1970s, a number
of different types of interferon were characterized. Differences were found on the
basis of cell types protected, and the stability of the interferons at different pH
(Table 7.1). The binding of interferon to speciﬁc receptors on the cell triggers a
large number of biochemical reactions, leading to the inhibition of virus replica-
tion or maturation and the induction of further interferon and other cytokines. The
system is much more complex than the early researchers of this ﬁeld could ever
have imagined.

Using mice as a model, experiments were initiated to examine whether inter-
feron produced in mouse cell culture culture could be used to inhibit virus
infection in mice, If given in large daily doses, interferon did inhibit the patho-
logical effects of the EMC virus, a virus causing paralysis and death in mice [8].
Antibodies were made to mouse and human interferon in rabbits that neutralized
the anti-viral effect in the mouse and the anti-viral effect of human interferon-
alpha.
7.5
Classification of Interferons
It was rather obvious by the 1970s that there were at least three major types of
interferons: alpha, beta, and gamma. These were deﬁned as interferons because of
their anti-viral activity in vitro. It was shown in 1984 [9] that there were separate
receptors for IFN-gamma and interferon alpha/beta [10]. IFN-alpha and -beta
attached to the same receptor(s) on the cell membrane, but the biological activity
of each of these three interferons was different.
Table 7.1 summarizes the differences between class I interferons (IFN-alpha
and beta) and class II interferon, IFN-gamma. The third column presents what is
known of a recently discovered interferon, IFN-lambda [11, 12].
7.6
Cloning of Interferon Genes
In 1980 the interferon alpha gene was cloned into E. coli and the methodology
used became standard for cloning mammalian genes in this bacterium. Double-
stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from random mRNA from

interferon-producing leukocytes (stimulated with Sendai virus) and cloned into an
E. coli plasmid, known as pBR 322. Five thousand bacterial clones were screened
by extracting plasmid DNA; they were expressed in frog oocytes, and those
synthesizing biologically active interferon isolated. mRNA coding for a poly-
peptide with IFN activity was isolated, and the IFN was shown to have normal
antiviral activity [13]. This research was done in the laboratory of Charles
Weissmann at the University of Zurich, and supported by a new biotech company,
Biogen. Fifteen percent of the shares of Biogen were held by Schering-Plough,
which eventually sold the interferon as Intron A in the U.S. market. This major
breakthrough in the cloning of IFN-a2a led to the cloning of other interferons.
Meanwhile, other biotech and pharmaceutical companies entered into this very
competitive market. The Wellcome Research Laboratories, one of the initial
companies involved in interferon research in the U.K., extracted interferon from
virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cells, and Searle Laboratories, also in England,
produced interferon from ﬁbroblasts. Biogen went on to sell interferon-beta 1a
(Avonex) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and eventually joined up with a
company specializing in monoclonal antibodies, Idec, to form one of the largest
biotech companies in the world. Interpharm in Israel began the manufacture and
production of IFN-beta in Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture, and ﬁnally
interferon gamma was cloned in 1981 at the Genentech Company in San Fran-
cisco. Thus interferon could now be produced in E. coli, yeast, and mammalian
cells [14, 15]. Interferon cloning led to the development of the biotech industry,
and for this alone it is historically signiﬁcant.
7.7
Interferon Alpha and Beta
Class I interferons have been studied more than class II, reﬂecting the fact that they
were discovered ﬁrst, cloned early, and used in the clinic. There appear to be many
types of IFN-alpha based on gene homology, [16] but only one type of IFN-beta.
Since the genes for all class 1 interferons reside on the same chromosome, it is
assumed that they arose as duplications of a single interferon gene. Using high
performance (or pressure) liquid chromatography (HPLC), it became possible to
purify the various interferons and assay them with a biological assay. Using ﬂuo-
rescent tags, the amino acid content and sequence of each type of interferon was
determined. There are as many as 24 different interferons that are classiﬁed as IFN-
a. Each one has a slightly different amino acid sequence, different speciﬁc activity
and antiviral spectrum [16]. Different cell types make different amounts of each
type; different genes codes for each one. Very little is known of the biological bases
of the multiple species and their activities, since most research has only been done
with one of these, termed IFNa2. This may not be the most active of the alpha
interferons; all the alpha interferons bind to the same receptor, and when one looks
at gene (protein) induction as measured by a few key induced proteins, the same
level of induction occurs in all cases, suggesting that a minimal amount of interferon
triggers activity [16]. Interferon-alpha is induced in various types of leukocytes.
7.6
Cloning of Interferon Genes
107

There is only one known species of IFN-beta, which shares 25 % amino acid
homology with IFN-a. IFN-b is produced by ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells in
response to virus and double-stranded RNA.
In the early 1990s a group of scientists at the Amgen biotech company attempted
to go one better than nature and create what they termed a ‘‘consensus interferon,’’
which was made by comparing the most common amino acids occurring in the
then-available 20 different species of IFN-alpha, constructing a ‘‘ gene’’ from these
amino-acids introducing this new ‘‘gene’’ into E. coli, and producing an active
molecule. A number of such molecules were produced, one of which had very high
speciﬁc activity. This molecule had higher speciﬁc activity in anti-viral activity,
and anti-tumor activity, as measured by the death of hairy cell leukemia cells, and
the activation of natural killer cells [17, 18]. Eventually, consensus interferon was
approved for the treatment of hepatitis C. A well-planned clinical trial was never
performed to examine whether consensus interferon was superior for the treatment
of hepatitis C than IFN-a2a (intron A) or IFN-a2b (Pegasys). However, in clinical
trials of HCV patients who were not responsive to IFN-a2a or IFN-a2b, there was a
30–50 % response rate.
7.8
Interferon-Gamma
Cells of the immune system produce interferon-gamma: dendritic cells, natural
killer cells (NK), both CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, and macrophages. Inter-
feron-gamma is also induced by cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, and by many growth
factors. It is also induced during viral infections in vivo as a part of the immune
system. IFN-gamma stimulates the expression of class I and class II MHC mol-
ecules and promotes the differentiation of naïve helper T-cells into Th1 cells,
activates dendritic and cytotoxic T-cells, and increases the cytotoxicity of NK
cells. Thus it is a key player in the immune response. (For an excellent short
summary of IFN-gamma activities, see http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/
immunology/students/spring2006/v_alvarez/ifn-gamma.html). IFN-gamma is an
important component of cellular immunity and plays a signiﬁcant role in cell
differentiation, cell growth, and cell survival. In fact, if IFN-gamma were to be
re-discovered today, it would not be called an ‘‘interferon’’ but rather an ‘‘inter-
leukin.’’
IFN-gamma binds to speciﬁc receptors on the cell membrane known as IFN-cR.
The bound receptor interacts with enzymes, JAK kinase (Just Another Kinase),
which phosphorylates STAT proteins, which in turn interact with speciﬁc DNA
sequences upstream of inducible genes that have sequences in their upstream
DNA, known as ‘‘GAS sequences’’ (gamma activated sequences—see Fig. 7.4).
The spectrum of genes induced by IFN-gamma overlap, but with some differences
from the genes induced by interferon alpha and beta [19]. One of the most studied
genes induced leads to the production of a protein, IDO (indoleamine 2,3-dioxy-
genase). This enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tryptophan (an essential
108

amino acid in humans) catabolism. In culture, cells die in the presence of inter-
feron gamma, unless supplemented with tryptophan [20, 21]. It has been suggested
that this enzyme is responsible for T-cell tolerance [22], is induced during
pregnancy, and is important in the maintenance of pregnancy in humans [23].
However, this latter hypothesis is controversial [24, 25]. IDO may also have
detrimental effects, being higher during septic shock and in certain types of can-
cers. Thus, the function of this enzyme, and many other proteins induced by the
interferons, are still unknown.

Interferon Lambda: Type III Interferons
More recently, another group of interferons, called ‘‘IFN-lambda,’’ has been dis-
covered. Recent studies with IFN-lambda indicate that it is close in structure to the
family of interleukins, IL10 and IL22 [26] and shares a common receptor
(Fig. 7.4). It does have anti-viral activity, and can possibly replace IFN-a in the
treatment of hepatitis C [27]. Since its discovery, the literature describing IFN-
lambda has ‘‘taken off,’’ and there are now hundreds of papers describing its
biological activities, which overlap with the other interferons although binding to a
different receptor. It may be useful in the treatment of viruses or cancers that have
proven resistant to other interferons.
7.10
Interferon’s Biological Activity
The complexity of the interferon system was reafﬁrmed when DNA microarrays
were introduced (DNA micro-arrays measure mRNA changes following treat-
ment of cells or whole animals or humans, contrasting two or more situations,
such as treatment with a pharmaceutical agent against a control, or a cancer cell
against a normal cell—see Fig. 7.5). Following treatment of cells with interferon-
alpha or interferon-gamma, hundreds of genes are induced, yielding overlapping
spectra for each type of interferon [28–30]. Many genes are also suppressed or
‘‘down-regulated’’ and most of the changes in gene expression are transient
in vivo in humans. Many of these genes are well recognized as markers of
interferon activity, but their function in regulating the response to virus is difﬁcult
to discern. It is becoming obvious that interferons are in fact part of a family of
cytokines that are produced by one cell, diffuse to and act on nearby cells, and so
drive the machinery of the immune response. Interferons induce many cytokines,
which in turn induce many other genes producing a complex cascade of inter-
actions. Cytokine biology is an area of biochemistry too complex to discuss here,
but it must be emphasized that it has become an important component of
immunology.
There are many questions that need to be answered in studying interferon at the
cellular level. What happens after interferon binds to the cell receptor and triggers
an anti-viral response? How does this response inhibit virus production? Has the
virus developed methods of overcoming the interferon response? Are there
speciﬁcity and differences among the various types of interferon? In answering
these questions, one delves into the basis of the innate immune response and the
relationship between the innate immune response and the induced cellular
immunity. Answers to some of these questions are found in Chap. 6 (on immu-
nology), and in Figs. 7.4 and 7.6.
As stated, interferons bind to speciﬁc receptors on the cell membrane. IFN
alphas and betas both bind to the same receptors, IFNAR1, IFNAR2, and IFN-
gamma bind to separate receptors, IFGNR1 and IFNGR2, and IFN-lambda to a
110

third set of receptors which are shared with interleukins IL10, IL28A, IL28B, and
IL29 [31] (see Fig. 7.4). Interestingly, virus infection also induces these inter-
leukins. Binding of the interferons activates a number of kinases, including a series
of proteins termed JAK kinases (Janus Kinase) which phosphorylate tyrosine on a
group of proteins known as STATS (Signal Transducer and Activator of Tran-
scription). The phosphorylation activates and leads to dimerization of these STAT
proteins. There are seven STAT proteins that have been recognized, each related to
a different function in either the immune response or metabolic response. The
function of these STAT proteins has been elucidated from ‘‘knock-out’’ mice, i.e.,
mice with speciﬁc genes (in this case STATs), deleted. STAT1 is involved with the
IFN-a/b and IFN-c signaling pathway, STAT 2 also with IFN-a/b pathway, STATs

3, 4, 5A and 5B, and 6 with other interleukins (cytokines). These STAT proteins in
turn form complexes with other proteins that bind to speciﬁc DNA sequences. In
type I interferon signaling, STAT1–STAT2 heterodimers combine with IRF9
(Interferon Response Factor 9, another family of transcription factors) to form
ISGF3 (Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor), which in turn binds to the ISRE
(Interferon Stimulated Response Element) promoter to induce what are termed
interferon-stimulated genes. STAT1 dimers bind to another sequence known as a
GAS sequence and interact with IRF1 to stimulate type II interferon genes (this is
illustrated in Fig. 7.4).
In uninfected cells there is no trace of interferon; the gene is completely
repressed. Virus infects a cell by binding to its unique receptor. After being taken
up by endosomes or entering the cell through the cell membrane, viral components
or viral dsRNA, which can only appear after initial viral replication, activate toll-
like receptors or the analogous RIGI system. This is done through ‘‘pathogen
associated recognition patterns,’’ which interact with toll-like receptors. This
interaction leads to kinase production, enzymes that phosphorylate proteins in a
complex reaction that in turn activate genes for interferon production through
complexes at speciﬁc sites on the promoters of the interferon genes, by a family of
molecules known as interferon response factors (IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-7). A similar
family of proteins stops the induction and silences the interferon genes (Fig. 7.6).
These proteins may function sequentially. Interferon can modulate immune
responses by its effects on Class I and Class II MHC molecules (see Chap. 6).

Interferons

IFN-alpha, IFN-beta and IFN-gamma increase expression of Class I molecules on
all cells, thereby promoting recognition by cytotoxic T-cells that can destroy
virus-infected cells. IFN-gamma can also increase expression of Class II MHC
molecules on antigen-presenting cells, resulting in better presentation of viral
antigens to CD4+ T helper cells. Furthermore, IFN-gamma can activate NK cells
and dendritic cells, which can kill virus-infected cells. As stated above, interferon
induces many genes that are involved in gene regulation, cell differentiation, other
cytokine induction and anti-viral activity. As discussed below, many viruses block
interferon activity, as shown in Fig. 7.7.
Figure 7.6 illustrates the pathway of an RNA virus. Viral double-stranded RNA,
an intermediate of virus replication, binds to proteins known as toll-like receptors,
which are proteins that alert the cell to the presence of a pathogen. A complex
forms on the toll-like receptor or RIG I, another toll-like receptor molecule, and
interacts with a number of proteins that migrate to the nucleus and activate the
genes for IFN, which in turn then activate nearby cells.

7.11
How Do Viruses Escape Interferon Activity?
Almost all viruses appear to have developed methods of evading interferon
activity. These include inhibition of interferon biosynthesis, blocking interferon
signaling, inhibiting the function of induced anti-viral proteins, and production of
decoys to molecules that induce interferon signaling (Fig. 7.7). At the biochemical
level, these include STAT protein degradation, inhibition of phosphorylation of
STAT proteins, and IRF-3 inhibition. Both hepatitis B virus and HIV have been
reported to block IFN-synthesis and signaling. The mechanism involved for all
viruses in cell culture are described in [33]. During hepatitis C infection, there is
robust interferon-stimulated gene transcription, [30, 34, 35] yet HCV persists to
replicate to high numbers in chronically infected patients, unless treated with very
large amounts of interferon and ribavirin. Under these conditions, some 70 % of
patients will still produce virus. One report indicates that HCV does activate the
enzyme protein kinase R (PKR), which normally would inhibit host protein syn-
thesis by phosphorylating an initiating factor eIF2a inhibiting host protein syn-
thesis, it appears to inhibit interferon stimulated gene production, thus dampening
the interferon effect [36]. Using a cell culture system and an artiﬁcial viral con-
struct (replicon, rather than complete virus), interferon activity was inhibited by
viral proteins NS5A, E2 and by the IRES element of HCV [37]. This emphasizes
the need to work with systems as close as possible to the ‘‘natural’’ infectious
process, since in man none of these mechanisms may be functioning. Viruses such
as hepatitis B, polio, SARS, adenovirus, and even HIV have been reported to
inhibit interferon activity in cell culture, yet many of them are sensitive to inter-
feron in man.
7.12
Clinical Studies of Interferons with Virus
Since 2002 interferon has been PEGylated to increase stability, with the addition
of a polyethylene glycol molecule. The major use of interferon in the clinic has
been in the treatment of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. In hepatitis B patients, the
response rate is between 15–40 % of treated patients responding with long-term
remission. IFN-alpha is used with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, Lamivudin.
Until recently, the standard treatment for hepatitis C in patients was a 48-week
regimen of interferon-alpha and the anti-viral drug ribavirin. The percentage of
patients with no detectable virus after completion of treatment was approximately
30 %, depending on the type of interferon used, the antigenic type of the virus, and
the race of the patients [38]. This protocol has recently been modiﬁed and usually
includes a viral protease inhibitor.
Interferon has also been used in many clinical trials with inconclusive results. A
small group of asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals were treated with IFN-a2b:
41 % had decreased viral titer, and no patients in the IFN-a group developed
AIDS-deﬁning opportunistic infection, compared with 5 patients in the placebo
group (P = 0.02) [39]. However, 35 % of the patients in the treatment group
114

Interferons

withdrew from the study because of the severity of the side effects. Other clinical
trials have not been so successful. Attempts to treat children with Japanese
encephalitis with IFN-alpha were unsuccessful, even though this virus and other
ﬂaviviruses are sensitive to interferon in cell culture [40]. During the SARS epi-
demic of 2002–2003, interferon was used among many other treatments, but the
data are inconclusive [41]. Overall, the effect of interferon on virus infections in
the clinical setting has been disappointing. Although interferon is active in
inhibiting many viruses in cell culture, it does not carry over to the clinic, and there
are many reasons for this. Most viruses induce interferon at an early stage of
infection, so that the effect of interferon on the virus is established during the
course of the infection, and additional amounts may not make much of a
difference.
Even in the case of chronic infections, such as hepatitis C, interferon is induced
and present during the infection [34]. It requires extremely high doses to have an
effect on the virus, and at these levels IFN is quite toxic. In most clinical trials, a
percentage of the patients will drop out of the trial. The experience with Japanese
encephalitis and HIV indicate that once a viral infection has been established, it is
difﬁcult to eradicate the virus with interferon. Even in cells in culture, the timing of
the addition of the interferon is crucial in inhibiting the virus. Long-term exposure
to interferon—as in the clinical treatment of hepatitis C—may cause a decrease in
white blood cells (leukopenia), leaving the patient susceptible to infections. Apart
from the problems with the treatment, interferon therapy is expensive, i.e.,
$10,000–$20,000 for a 48-week regimen of interferon plus ribavirin.
7.13
Interferon as an Anti-cancer Agent
Although originally characterized as an anti-viral agent, to everyone’s surprise
interferon was also an anti-cancer agent. The ﬁrst experiments performed were on
mouse leukemia known to be of viral origin, including Friend’s leukemia (iden-
tiﬁed by Charlotte Friend in 1957) and Rauscher’s leukemia; both tumors later
identiﬁed of retrovirus origin. However, interferon was not only active against
tumors caused by viruses but against a large number of transplantable mouse
tumors of different origins. In these experiments, tumors were injected intra-
peritoneally or intramuscularly, so that the interferon could be administered
directly into the tumor.
Interferon later became a standard treatment for a number of types of human
cancers, including hairy cell leukemia, Kaposi’s sarcoma in AIDS patients, chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML), and papilloma infections (warts) [42].
By 1982 a phase 1 trial was conducted in a large group of patients with various
cancers. There was a variety of side effects now known to occur with interferon
therapy, including nausea, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, and occasionally ele-
vated liver enzymes. However, there was objective evidence of antitumor activity
in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), Hodgkin’s
disease, breast cancer, and melanoma [43]. One of the ﬁrst clinical uses of
7.12

interferon (IFN) was in the treatment of a rare leukemia known as hairy cell
leukemia, which results from over-production of mature (and abnormal) B-cells.
The cells under the microscope have a hairy morphology, hence the name. These
cells in culture are very sensitive to interferon [44]. There are approximately 500
new cases of hairy cell leukemia each year in the U.S. Interferon (alpha, or beta,
which was discovered later) is the therapeutic of choice, and about 80–90 % of
patients will respond to treatment with remission for a period. Interferon therapy
did extend the life span in early-stage melanoma and early-stage CML; however,
in clinical trials it is inefﬁcient against solid tumors. In Kaposi’s sarcoma, as
occurs in AIDS patients, it was effective if injected directly into the lesion, but not
systemically. A major problem is the large dose of interferon required in any
treatment as well as the severe side effects.
IFN-beta has been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. The
response to the drug varies and in some cases is ineffective, depending on the
source of the interferon and the type of multiple sclerosis. Several studies have
found IFN-b beneﬁcial in reducing rates of relapse, whereas others have reported
no beneﬁt in this regard [45].

The Interferon Society
The ﬁrst meeting of those interested in interferon was held in 1964 in Bratislava (at
that time in Czechoslovakia but today in Slovakia). There were sporadic meetings
during the 1960s and early 1970s, but without an ofﬁcial organization. A report in
1974 claiming that interferon produced by Cantell could be used to treat cancer
motivated a meeting in New York, organized by Mathilde Krim to stimulate
interest in interferon and its anti-cancer activities. Dr. Krim was an activist in
medical research, and was a faculty member of the Sloan Kettering Institute for
Cancer Research. She was a well-known ‘‘socialite’’in New York and her party for
President Kennedy’s 45th birthday was quite famous. She later became an AIDS
activist, recognizing early on the problems and ethical dilemmas of the disease.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathilde_Krim). Bill Stewart, one of the early pio-
neers of interferon research, founded the Interferon Society in 1982. The ﬁrst
formal meeting and the publication of the J. Interferon Research occurred in 1983.
The society met once a year with the presentation of papers on the three major
classes of interferons (a, b, and c). The Journal of Interferon Research, only for
papers on interferon, was established (although papers on interferon were pub-
lished in other journals related to virology).
By 1989 the importance of the cytokines and their relationship to interferon was
beginning to be realized, and the journal changed its name to the Journal of
Interferon and Cytokine Research to encompass papers dealing with ‘‘other
interferons,’’ which were not called interferons but a variety of names based on
their activities, such as the ‘‘tumor necrosis factor’’ (which was initially called
lymphotoxin), IL-1, IL-2, etc. A separate Society of International Cytokine
Research (ICS) was established in 1989. There is also a Journal of Cytokine
116

Research, which publishes papers on interferon research. We do not know how
many cytokines (initially lymphokines, now interleukins) exist. The International
Society for Interferon Research joined with the Cytokine Society in 2012 to form
one organization for scientists working in both areas, which were obviously now
interconnected. This would be known as the International Cytokine and Interferon
Society. Many of the other cytokines (interleukins) are being tested for their effects
on diseases and cancer.

Conclusions
The days of interferon as a clinical entity may be over. It has been replaced in the
treatment of viral infections by small molecules that inhibit speciﬁcally viral
enzymes, and such molecules may have fewer side effects. Interferon is still an
important molecule to study since it elucidates the workings of the immune sys-
tem. It is an important ‘‘backup’’ in the event of a sudden outbreak of an unknown
virus epidemic; this was demonstrated during the SARS epidemic, when there was
no alternative but interferon. There is not yet sufﬁcient knowledge of the new
interferons recently discovered, or whether they will have clinical applications.

Cancer and Viruses
Abstract
Cancer morbidity decreased in the last few years of the twentieth century, in
large part due to early detection as well as the campaign against tobacco. The
relationship between viruses and cancer, and the elaboration of the oncogene
theory—from the early work on phage lambda and lysogeny—to oncogenes is
presented. The majority of cancers result from somatic mutations and
chromosomal rearrangements, which may cause proto-oncogene activation.
Mutations in tumor suppressor genes also end in tumor formation. The function
of these different genes is discussed, as are hereditary cancers. Viruses—such as
papilloma, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, human herpes 8, Epstein-Barr virus and
HTLV-1—induce cancers by varied mechanisms.
8.1
The War on Cancer
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. (after heart disease). In
2010, over 500,000 people died of cancer in the U.S. Millions of dollars have been
spent on ﬁnding a cure, and President Nixon proposed a ‘‘War on Cancer,’’ saying
on December 23, 1971, ‘‘I will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $100
million to launch an intensive campaign to ﬁnd a cure for cancer. The time
has come in America when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the
atom and took man to the moon should be turned toward conquering this
dread disease. Let us make a total national commitment to achieve this goal.’’
According to Vincent DeVita, M.D., director of The National Cancer Institute
from 1980–1988, the ‘‘War on Cancer’’ ‘‘…did everything it was supposed to do.
It supported basic and applied research…’’ The frequency of cancer and
mortality from cancer started dropping in the U.S. in 1990 and has continued to
drop every year. ‘‘And the morbidity from cancer, comparing 1971–2005, is
like night and day, so every benchmark has been hit.’’

Both frequency and death rates from all cancers combined declined signiﬁ-
cantly in the last twenty years for both men and women and for most racial and
ethnic populations. Between 1990/1991 and 2009, the most recent year for which
data is available, overall death rates decreased by 24 % in men, 16 % in women,
and 20 % overall. These decreases were mostly in both occurrence and death rates
for the three most common cancers in men (lung, prostate and colorectal cancer),
and for two of the three leading cancers in women (breast and colorectal). Overall,
the decline was signiﬁcant for most cancers, although on examining the data it was
quite modest. These data are more the result of early screening and the campaign
against smoking than treatment. Some cancers and mortalities have remained
static. (A breakdown of the prevalence and results of treatment of each cancer can
be found at http://seer.cancer.gov/). There were 232,340 new cases of breast
cancer in the U.S. in 2013, with an estimated 39,620 deaths. The percentage living
ﬁve years after diagnosis was 89.2 % for 2003–2009. It is estimated that 12.3 % of
women living in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer sometime in their
lives; there are currently 2,829,094 women living with breast cancer in the U.S.
New cancer drugs—that certainly in the case of breast cancer have extended the
life of the patients—have come on the market. Lists of new drugs (as well as old)
and ongoing clinical trials for different types of cancer can be found at http://www.
cancer.gov/. The development of the monoclonal antibody Herceptin, against
Her2+(ERb2 oncogene) receptor in breast cancer combined with other therapies,
such as taxol, has been quite effective in metastatic breast cancer. This is the ﬁrst
drug derived from monoclonal antibody research. The cost of treatment with this
and other drugs of this class is extremely high, reﬂecting the cost of research in this
area. Another drug, Gleevac (Imatinibmesylate), inhibits a key enzyme (tyrosine
kinase) in cell replication and has been successfully used in the treatment of
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. This is
the ﬁrst of a new class of anti-cancer molecules derived from small molecules that
target speciﬁc metabolic enzymes involved or regulating cell replication.
Despite the glowing report of Dr. DeVita, there is some disagreement in the
cancer research community as to whether the touted success is justiﬁed. Many
oncologists and researchers feel that the NCI has stiﬂed research (as has the
American Cancer Society) by funding research on chemotherapeutic agents and
radiation rather than more novel approaches to treatment, such as the use of immune-
therapeutic, naturally occurring agents, viral oncolysis and gene therapy. Another
complaint is that not enough time and money were spent on attempting to ﬁnd the
root causes of cancer. It is now generally accepted that cancer is a genetic disease in
which many gene products are affected, either by a primary mutation in one key
gene, or by numerous mutations in an array of genes. Thus instead of treating cancers
by organ pathology, it is essential to identify which gene(s) are mutated or activity-
enhanced and to tailor treatment accordingly. This will require a new approach to
cancer diagnosis as well as treatment. Platforms such as DNA—micro-arrays in
which the expression of many genes can be examined at the same time—should
eventually lead to individualized treatment. A microarray may show numerous
changes or differences between a normal tissue and a cancerous one, but it is nearly
122
8
Cancer and Viruses

impossible to identify with certainty the relevant gene; even so, great progress has
been made in this area and it is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
Chemotherapy is poisonous and in many cases does not extend life. In large part,
the treatment of cancer has been driven by the pharmaceutical industry, which has
developed hundreds of compounds that do eliminate cancer cells, but also at the
expense of destroying healthy cells. In the same fashion as the development of new
anti-virals, such as protease or replicase inhibitors, it should be possible to target
speciﬁc enzymes that are unique to the cancer cell, or to surface markers on the
cancer cells. Large numbers of monoclonal antibodies have been produced both
against surface markers and even internal proteins of cancer cells. A list of such
monoclonal
antibodies
is
available
at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_
therapeutic_monoclonal_antibodies. Many of these are currently undergoing clin-
ical trials. Within the next few years this should be a standard mode of treatment.
8.2
Introduction to Cancer at the Molecular Level
Although Peyton Rous discovered that avian tumors could be transmitted from
chicken to chicken by injection of tumor material at the turn of the twentieth century,
its applicability to human cancer was not realized. It was thought, at the time, that this
was an oddity of the avian world; that viruses might be involved in human cancer was
not investigated until the 1950s with the discovery that viruses caused tumors in mice
and other rodents. Over the next 50 years, the emphasis in cancer research was on the
interrelationship between viruses, particularly retroviruses and cancer. However, a
viral origin for all cancer is no longer acceptable; it is only one component of a very
complicated biological story. It is estimated that only 20 % of cancers are related to
virus infection; these include Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes 8 (Kaposi’s sar-
coma), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, papilloma and retroviruses.
The more cancer was studied, the more it was realized that the majority of
cancers are genetic defects of the cell resulting from mutation—either spontaneous
or as a result of environmental insult that damages DNA. Cancer cells also arise as
a result of chromosomal breakage and rearrangement. Many other cancers are
inherited as a result of a mutation carried in families of speciﬁc ethnic groups, such
as the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations that cause breast and other cancers in
Ashkenazi Jewish women and occasionally result in cancer in men.
Cancers of the same tissue may differ and result from multiple mutations in
different genes. Hundreds of genes have been identiﬁed as being involved in
cancer, either as the primary mutation or as a secondary defect due to the acti-
vation (disruption) of multiple biological pathways. Some of these mutations result
in defects in apoptosis, the name given to the process of natural cell death; other
mutations result in disruption in the regulation of cell division. Cells usually stop
dividing when they reach a speciﬁc stage of differentiation, i.e., kidney cells will
stop dividing when the kidney is formed. Likewise, blood cells of various types
have a deﬁnite half-life, stop dividing, and only divide for replacement. If new
8.1
The War on Cancer
123

cells are needed, these are provided by stem cells that differentiate to the required
tissue. Cancerous cells, on the other hand, continue to divide—ignoring signals to
stop dividing, and cancer cells grow much faster than normal cells since signals
that naturally would slow or stop growth are now continuously ‘‘ﬁring.’’ Cancer
cells have acquired the property of immortality, and since they are not foreign
cells, they may not be recognized by the immune system, although it is hypoth-
esized that there is a general surveillance system that will eliminate cancerous
cells. This may be one of the roles of the ‘‘natural killer cells’’ that circulate in the
blood.
Diagnostically, cancers fall into two classes: benign or malignant. These are
clinical terms to distinguish the aggressiveness of the tumor. Box 1 lists deﬁnitions
used in describing cancer. A benign tumor is one in which the tumor, a mass of
cells, has been contained at the site of origin and has not spread through the blood
and lymphatic system to other sites, whereas a malignant tumor is one where the
cancerous cells have spread systemically and colonized other areas of the body.
This results in the establishment of the cancer at another site and is known as
‘‘metastasis’’ and is a hallmark of malignancy. This is how cells of prostate origin
can be found in bone marrow, or breast cancer cells at sites other than the
mammary glands. Another term often used to refer to tumor initiation is ‘‘onco-
genesis.’’ As will be discussed later, genes that appear to be primarily implicated
in cancer are referred to as ‘‘oncogenes.’’ The examples given above, of two drugs
that affect cancerous growth—Herceptin and Gleevec—are examples of drugs that
affect oncogenes and their biological pathways.
Box 1. Terminology
Some basic terminology:
Oncogenesis = process of
initiation of
tumours (cancer)
in an organism
(onkos = mass; genesis = birth)
Tumor = tissue composed of cells that deviate from normal program of cell
division and differentiation.
Benign tumor = tumor cells remain together in a single mass and do not invade
and disrupt surrounding tissues
Malignant tumor = tumor cells invade and disrupt surrounding tissues.
Metastasis = spread of malignant tumor cells throughout the body typically
through the blood and lymphatic system
8.3
Oncogenes
Normal cell growth is controlled by growth factors, proteins that bind to speciﬁc
receptors on the cell surface, or on the nuclear membrane. These signals appear to
be of two classes—those that stimulate cell division, and those that inhibit cell
division. These transcription factors migrate to the nucleus of the cell and activate
genes to produce proteins (oncoproteins) that stimulate cell division, and sup-
pressor proteins that suppress cell division (Figs. 8.1, 8.2, 8.3).
124

Cancer and Viruses

The fact that a single mutation in an oncogene may have multiple consequences
downstream from the primary event makes it difﬁcult to identify the primary event
and to develop small molecules that may target the oncogene. Some DNA and
RNA viruses can trigger cancerous growth, by mechanisms similar to those dis-
cussed above, by affecting an oncogene or, in some cases, inhibiting tumor
Fig. 8.1 Proto-oncogene and suppressor genes. Mutants in proto-oncogenes have a gain of
function; those in suppressor have a loss of function. Both enhance growth of the tumor
Fig. 8.2 Gain of function by mutation in proto-oncogene. Constant binding leads to cell growth
8.3
Oncogenes
125

suppressors—or in others, by activating genes generally silent (this will be dis-
cussed later in this chapter).
Figure 8.2 shows what happens if a regulatory gene is mutated. The normal
protein binds only under special circumstances, such as when a growth signal is
received at the cell plasma membrane. In the heterozygote, the mutant oncogene
protein can bind to the DNA (in the absence of a signal) and produce growth. Thus
the mutation is dominant over the wild type, as there will be mutant protein in the
heterozygote that can always signal growth. The rate of growth may be further
enhanced if both copies of the gene are mutated, although in most cases one
mutation may be sufﬁcient.
8.4
Tumor Suppressor Genes
Healthy cells will usually die by apoptosis if there is an accumulation of any
injury, particularly DNA damage. In cancer cells, proteins that usually function in
the process of repair (for example, a protein known as ‘‘p53’’) do not recognize
DNA damage and the cell continues to replicate. A protein such as p53 that
removes DNA damage and restores normal growth is known as a ‘‘suppressor’’
gene product, since it suppresses tumor growth. A mutant form of the TP53 gene
occurs in about 50 % of human tumors, and in about 80 % of colon cancers. p53
normally inhibits DNA replication if the DNA is damaged. Transgenic mice with
deletion in the TP53 gene are viable, and appear normal, but close to 100 %
develop cancer within 10 months.
Fig. 8.3 Function of tumor suppressor gene p53. Adenovirus binds to p53 and prevents its
functioning; papilloma virus protease degrades p53. Both cases lead to tumor formation.
Adenovirus does not cause tumors in man but does lead to tumors in hamsters and transforms
cells in culture
126

Cancer and Viruses

Cells in culture can easily be transformed into tumor cells by infecting them
with a series of DNA viruses such as polyoma, SV-40, and adenovirus. Viral
proteins interact with host proteins that usually suppress the cell cycle and inhibit
these genes, resulting in uncontrolled growth of the transformed cell (Fig. 8.3).
Another major human suppressor gene is the Rb or retinoblastoma gene that is
expressed in all cells and is involved in cell cycle control. In humans, a mutation in
both copies of this gene results in tumors in the eye, hence the original name
‘‘retinoblastoma’’ [1] (Fig. 8.4). Suppressor genes require two mutations, one in
each allele, to be totally non-functional.
8.5
Chromosomal Aberrations
An alternative theory of cancer genesis not involving viruses has become more
acceptable in the last few years. It has been proposed that cancers occur as a result
of multiple mutations possibly due to a master ‘‘mutator’’ gene, such as a gene
involved in DNA repair, resulting in a thousand-fold increase in the mutation rate,
most of which will occur in oncogenes. A related hypothesis is that cancer arises
from chromosomal breakage, i.e., translocation of one segment of a chromosome
to another chromosome, or due to aneuploidy (an aberrant chromosome number)
resulting from breakage of chromosomes during cell division. Such aneuploidy
may increase with time, resulting in a tumor with a very abnormal chromosome
composition. Many types of tumors, particularly leukemia, show this phenomenon,
as do cultured cells. This mechanism of cancer formation has been proposed by
Peter Duesberg for many years [2] (see Fig. 8.5). The aneuploidy theory of cancer
is a very old one that was ﬁrst proposed by the German embryologist Theodor

gene (Rb). Both alleles must be mutated to give rise to cancerous cells

Boveri in 1902 in a classic paper that was translated and annotated by Dr. Henry
Harris in 2008 [3]. Interestingly, this paper touches upon many of the topics still
discussed today in relation to cancer, problems of malignancy, and the relationship
of disjunction of chromosomes and tumor development. Boveri worked with sea
urchin eggs and often noted that cells (embryos) with abnormal chromosomes did
not develop normally; many died, but a few did survive. He wrote, ‘‘But the
essential element in our hypothesis is not the abnormal mitosis, but always a
speciﬁc abnormal chromosome constitution. However this might arise, a particular
tumor will be the result’’ (Fig. 8.6).
8.6
Viral-Oncogene Theory of Cancer
It was an accepted theory during the last half of the twentieth century that viruses
caused most cancers. The observation that retroviruses carried ‘‘oncogenes’’
resulted in a burst of research activity resulting in Nobel Prizes for the viral origins
of cancer. Some viruses are still implicated in cancer, in particular the DNA
viruses such as papilloma (cervical cancer in particular), human herpes virus-8,
Epstein-Barr virus, the causative agent of a number of types of lymphomas,
hepatitis B and C, HTLV-1 and, just recently implicated, a polyoma virus [4]. The
viral-oncogene theory of cancer derived from ideas explaining lysogeny in bac-
terial systems. There are two slightly different oncogene theories, one proposed by
George Todaro and Huebner [5], and the other by Ludwig Gross [6].

Cancer and Viruses

The replication cycle of viruses has been discussed elsewhere in this volume.
Most viruses replicate and produce more of themselves through the lytic cycle. In
the 1950s, it was noted that under speciﬁc circumstances, some bacteriophage do
not undergo the normal lytic cycle, but rather integrate into the bacterial host
chromosomal DNA and reside in the bacterial chromosome. Such bacteriophage
could be activated from a dormant state to a lytic state by treating the cells with
UV light, or during the transfer of the bacterial chromosome from one host to the
other (a type of mating that can occur between related species of bacterium)
resulting in viral replication. Such bacteriophage were called ‘‘temperate phage’’
and are discussed in detail in Chap. 5.
A similar model was proposed to explain the origins of tumor viruses (called C-
type particles) and cancer [7]. Based on work with cells in culture, particularly
cells of rodent origin, Todaro and Huebner suggested that all cells contained genes
that were the result of viral infections far back in evolutionary time, i.e., possibly
millions of years ago. Thus the genes of retroviruses are present in all mammalian
cells, but expression is repressed. These genes could be activated by treatment with
UV radiation, or potential mutagens or compounds that interfered with DNA
synthesis. Thus new viruses could be formed from the component parts, which did
not have to be on the same chromosome, and occasionally the virus could
incorporate an oncogene and express this in the cell-triggering tumor formation;
these were known as ‘‘C-type particles’’ (Fig. 8.7).

8.6
Viral-Oncogene Theory of Cancer
129

Although parts of this model have proven to be correct, there is no evidence that
C-type particles (retroviruses) are formed in this way. Retroviruses do carry
oncogenes, which can be inserted into the chromosome, and since they are under
the control of viral promoters, they are expressed. If a retrovirus is integrated next
to an oncogene, that oncogene can be activated and expressed abnormally,
resulting in leukemia. The fact that all cells would carry viral genes and that such
genes would be transmitted to further generations was termed ‘‘vertical trans-
mission’’ rather than ‘‘horizontal transmission’’ when the virus would spread from
cell to cell. Todaro and Huebner [7] point out that this differs from the phage
lambda model, in that the phage can be lytic and is not necessarily carried for
lengthy periods as part of the host genetic material.
An alternative model was proposed by Ludwig Gross [6] to explain the vertical
transmission and familial incidence of leukemia in mice and other animals. In this
model, C-type particles exist in all cells, including embryonic stem cells, and are
transmitted vertically to daughter cells. This virus entered the cell (animal) mil-
lions of years ago and may exist, latent and harmless, for long evolutionary
periods. Activation of the virus, leading to tumor formation, may occur because of
environmental insults or hormonal changes and leukemia or some other cancer
occurs. Gross predicted that such viruses would eventually be found in humans.
Apart from HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, the ﬁrst associated with T-cell leukemia, [8]
such viruses have not been found, but of course this does not mean that such
viruses do not exist in the human population. It is hypothesized that such viruses, if
they do exist, cause leukemia by integrating near an oncogene, which is now under
the control of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR), equivalent of a strong promoter
region rather than its own promoter. That such retrovirus sequences exist in our
DNA and that of other mammals has been conﬁrmed.

Cancer and Viruses

This model is applicable to retroviruses, but not to other viruses that cause
cancers. Most retroviruses integrate their nucleic acid into the host chromosome,
resulting in cell transformation in culture, and tumor formation in vivo. Such
viruses produce low levels of new viruses, often defective and needing a ‘‘wild
type’’ of virus to complete their replication.
This model explains the integration of HIV into the host chromosome, since
HIV is in many respects a typical retrovirus, but more complicated, having genes
other than the usual gag-pol-env genes found in most retroviruses. Neither HIV nor
HTLV-1 are defective viruses and cause cancer by other mechanisms.
8.7
Retroviruses and Cancer
Retroviruses are RNA viruses that undergo a DNA stage during viral replication
and integrate into the host chromosome. David Baltimore and Howard Temin
independently found the enzyme ‘‘reverse transcriptase,’’ [9, 10] and both received
the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in 1975. The reverse-
transcriptase enzyme copies RNA into DNA by a complex mechanism. Integration
of the viral chromosome into the host chromosome occurs by an intricate mech-
anism involving two enzymes, a recombinase and integrase enzyme, which
together open up the double-stranded DNA, and integrate the viral genes into the
host chromosome.
A schematic presentation of a typical retrovirus and the gene order is presented
in Figs. 8.8 and 8.9. Most retroviruses contain three blocks of genes: ‘‘gag,’’
‘‘pol,’’ and ‘‘env.’’ (gag stands for group antigen, the genes that make up the
capsid; pol. for polymerase, in this case the reverse transcriptase and integrase; and
env. for the lipid membrane that surrounds the capsid or core Fig. 8.10). Examples
of retroviruses include Rous sarcoma virus, the ﬁrst tumor virus discovered; mouse
mammary tumor virus, a virus vertically transmitted from mother to daughter;
HTLV-1, known to cause a rare leukemia in man; HTLV-2, which is associated
with hairy cell leukemia; and HIV-1 and 2, the causative agent of AIDS and ‘‘slim
disease’’ respectively. Since the viral RNA is copied into DNA and is integrated
into the chromosome (possibly at random or at a few speciﬁc sites), it replicates as
part of the cell chromosome and its genes are expressed in these cells. If the virus
contains an oncogene, this is also expressed during replication and can result in
unlimited growth of the cell. The oncogene would replace part of one of the viral
genes.
The genome of a typical retrovirus includes a long sequence of RNA at both
ends. In the integrated form, it is known as the ‘‘LTR’’ (Long Terminal Repeat)
(Fig. 8.10) and includes sequences for regulation of transcription and a site that
primes the reverse transcriptase (PBS). This is the promoter region of the viral
chromosome. Next are the sequences gag-pol-env, which code for the structural
components of the virus as well as the reverse transcriptase and outer envelope.
This is followed by a repeat of the LTR. This infers that after insertion of the virus
8.6
Viral-Oncogene Theory of Cancer
131

into the chromosome, the end LTR could be next to an oncogene, a gene regulating
cell division. The presence of this LTR sequence or promoter is sufﬁcient to
‘‘drive’’ this gene rather than the native promoter. This is the basis of certain viral
leukemias, where an oncogene is not transposed by the virus, but the LTR is next
to a proto-oncogene; this effect on a nearby gene is known as ‘‘insertional onco-
genesis’’ (Fig. 8.11), which illustrates the incorporation of an oncogene into a
series of retroviruses.

Cancer and Viruses

Using a different approach to identify genes involved in cancer, Robert
Weinberg and colleagues at MIT [11] identiﬁed cancer-causing genes by trans-
forming a mouse cell line known as 3T3, with DNA from various human cancers.
They selected the transformed cells using a selective gene and re-isolated the
human DNA from the mouse background. Using this approach, they identiﬁed
mutant genes involved in cancer formation. These were mostly genes involved in
gene regulation and gene transcription, and thus a list of potential oncogenes was
created. These were in many cases identical to genes shown to be carried by
retroviruses.

In fact, the more cancers are examined at the molecular level, the more
mutations in different genes are found, and each mutation may lead to differences
in the growth rate of the tumor and affect the response to anti-tumor drugs. Pap-
illoma virus initiates tumor formation by one of the viral proteins interacting with
p53 and preventing its activity.
8.8
The BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genes
Other suppressor genes are involved in hereditary breast cancer. BRCA1 and
BRCA2 produce tumor suppressor proteins that help repair damaged DNA. About
5 % of breast cancers are hereditary. If DNA is not repaired, there is an increased

likelihood of mutation. Together, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for
about 20–25 % of hereditary breast cancers [12] and about 5–10 % of all breast
cancers [13]. In addition, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for around
15 % of ovarian cancers overall [14]. Either sex can transmit defects in the
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
The link between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation and breast cancer was dis-
covered in 1994. Follow-up studies done with DNA samples from individuals with
Tay-Sach’s disease, a disease of Ashkenazi Jews, showed a high prevalence of
mutations in these genes in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, although mutations
in these genes are not conﬁned to this group. Because of reproductive isolation,
later generations of an isolated population will have a higher frequency of
mutation than in the original population (Fig. 8.12). Today, one person in 40
among Ashkenazi Jews carries a 185delAG mutation in BRCA1, which places
them at higher-than- average risk for breast and ovarian cancer.
Three speciﬁc mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for 90 % of
the mutations identiﬁed in Ashkenazim. A different spectrum of mutation has been
found in other groups; thus, the treatment for breast cancer has to be individually
catered, since even though the same gene may be involved, the mutation may be at
a different site within the gene and result in a differential response to chemo-
therapeutic agents [15, 16] (Figs. 8.13, 8.14). These mutations are carried in every
cell of the body, and predispose towards cancer (Fig. 8.15).

DNA Tumor Viruses
In culture, most DNA tumor viruses readily transform cells. Such transformed
cells have all the characteristics of tumor cells: unlimited growth, lack of contact
inhibition, and the ability to grow freely in agar and give rise to tumors when
injected into nude mice (i.e., mice lacking an immune system). These viruses
include polyoma, SV-40, and adenovirus. Hepatitis B and papilloma viruses grow
very poorly in culture.
Papilloma virus: The human papilloma virus (HPV) is one of the most com-
mon virus groups to affect the skin and mucosal areas of the body. More than 40 of
the 150 types of papilloma virus recognized are sexually transmitted. Some
antigenic strains of this virus cause cervical cancer in women, while other strains
cause a variety of warts, mostly benign. Approximately 42 % of all women have a
papilloma infection at any point in time; 10 % of all human cancers and 16 % of
all female cancers may be HPV-linked. Two of the papilloma viruses, types 16 and
18, cause almost all cancers. Squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx, esophagus,
and lung are histologically similar to cervical carcinomas.
Tumors are mostly of epithelial origin (skin cells). The epithelial surfaces
include all areas covered by skin and/or mucosa, such as the mouth, throat, tongue,
tonsils, vagina, penis, and anus. Different strains of the human papilloma virus are
known to infect different parts of the body. Papilloma virus also causes a variety of
warts on the hands and feet and penile warts in men (Fig. 8.16).

HPV infection is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. About
50 % of sexually active people in the USA (both sexes) have HPV at some time in
their lives, although the virus is often transmitted without the person knowing that
he or she is infected. It can be transmitted during vaginal or anal intercourse, or by
oral sex. The Pap smear, which should be taken every year in sexually active
women, tests for the presence of early stages of cervical cancer. Newer tests detect
the presence of papilloma virus DNA. A vaccine against the tumor-causing strains
has recently been developed and approved. The vaccine (Gardasil) consists of four
inactivated papilloma virus types (6, 11, 16 and 18), all known to cause cervical
cancer and penile warts; types 6 and 11 are the most common that infect humans.
The vaccine has not yet been licensed for use in men although this is under study,
since it may prevent penile warts and certainly would inhibit the spread of the
disease. The application of the vaccine, however, has run into controversy. The
CDC has recommended vaccination for girls aged 11–26, but the question has
arisen whether the use of this vaccine, particularly among teens, will encourage
promiscuity. Since the vaccine is new, it is not known how long immunity will
last. Some of these questions are the same as will arise if and when there is a
vaccine against HIV. Figure 8.17 illustrates the number of cases of papilloma
cancers world-wide. Note that it is predominantly cervical and anal cancer.

Herpes virus. A number of cancers have been associated with herpes virus (see
Chapter on herpes), including Burkitt’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
and Kaposi’s sarcoma. Herpes virus is usually a passenger in many tumors, as
appears to be the case in cervical cancer and brain tumors. At one time it was
believed that herpes type 2 infection led to cervical cancer, but as discussed above,
this cancer is known to result from the papilloma virus.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) virus is an interesting virus in that it causes Bur-
kitt’s lymphoma in some populations, nasopharyngeal cancer in others, and the
self-limiting disease of mononucleosis in a third population. Thus, there seems to
be either a genetic predisposition or environmental factor related to the infection.
EBV is very common, with more than 90 % of individuals in the US testing
positive for EBV antigens. The virus is ubiquitous and latent in most individuals,
residing in B-lymphocytes. EBV can go through two alternate pathways, either a
lytic pathway, in which more virus is produced (although the cells do not lyse but
rather bud out virus) or a latent pathway in which a subset of genes is active in
repressing the lytic response. The virus is capable of immortalizing B-lymphocytes
in culture, which is similar to a leukemic effect in vivo. In mononucleosis, the
virus multiplies in B-cells, causing a severe immune reaction with expansion of
CD8 T-cells. The symptoms of mononucleosis (also called glandular fever) are
sore throat with swelling of lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Epstein-Barr virus has
also been associated with ‘‘chronic fatigue syndrome’’ and rheumatoid arthritis.
However, there is no ﬁrm evidence of a causative link between this virus and these
conditions.
Burkitt’s lymphoma is widespread in areas of East and Equatorial Africa and
occasionally outside them. In East Africa, it accounts for 74 % of childhood
cancers. Children in this area often have malaria, which appears to predispose
them to Burkitt’s lymphoma. Most children by age three are EBV-positive and
carry a latent virus. Recent research has shown that Plasmodium falciparum (the
agent responsible for malaria) membrane protein-1 can activate a latent EB virus
in B-cells. The tumor invariably has a translocation of chromosome 8 with
transposition of the myc gene, an important oncogene to another chromosome. The
disease characteristically involves the jaw or other facial bones, and sometimes
ovaries, kidneys or breasts. That there is a relationship to malaria in African cases
is noted by the low rate of Burkitt’s lymphoma in Africans with sickle-cell anemia,
which protects against malarial infection and low frequencies in areas of Africa
where there is little malaria. However, the intricacies of this relationship with
malaria are still not clear but appear to be very complex [17].
The sporadic type of Burkitt’s lymphoma (also known as ‘‘non-African’’) is
another form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The tumor cells have a similar
appearance to the cancer cells of classic African or endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma.
Non-Hodgkin’s, which includes Burkitt’s, accounts for 30–50 % of childhood
lymphomas. One ﬁnds the same chromosomal translocation, the translocation of
the myc gene. Another signiﬁcant difference is the age of onset of the lymphoma;
in East Africa the onset occurs in young children around age three, while in other
locations it is in older persons.

Kaposi’s sarcoma. What was until recently a rare cancer initiated by a herpes
virus has been discovered in patients in the early stages of AIDS. Kaposi’s sar-
coma was one of the initial opportunistic infections ﬁrst characterized in early
AIDS patients, [18] later shown to be of viral origin [19]. The virus triggering
Kaposi’s sarcoma is human herpesvirus-8. During the early stages of the AIDS
epidemic, more than 50 % of the patients had Kaposi’s sarcoma, a very high rate
for a malignant disease. This was one of the distinguishing ‘‘marks’’ of AIDS,
since the tumor causes ‘‘raised purple’’ marks on the skin. At that time, it was
proposed that this was due to a sexually transmitted virus that appeared only in
immune-compromised individuals. KS also occurs at a high rate in Sub-Saharan
Africa independent of AIDS, and in these cases it is not sexually transmitted. The
virus can exist in a latent stage or lytic stage. How the virus is transmitted is still
unclear, although there are indications that it can be spread in saliva. In the latent
stage, viral genes interact with tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb. HHV8 is not
integrated into the chromosome, but exists as an episome, an independent self-
replicating circular fragment of DNA.
8.10
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
There are as many as 2.7 million cases of hepatitis C in the U.S., and about 15
million worldwide. The rate varies from country to country, with Egypt, and
possibly China, India and Japan having the highest incidence. HCV is spread by
intravenous drug users sharing needles, thus the percentage of infection is high
among drug addicts and prisoners. It is also spread by blood transfusion, which is
performed in many third world countries under less-than-sterile conditions. There
is little evidence of sexual transmission. Unlike the other viruses discussed above,
HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus.
In a few individuals, the disease is self-limiting (acute infection), whereas in the
majority of cases there is chronic infection. About 1 % of chronic infected indi-
viduals will go on to develop liver cancer. Although work is ongoing, a vaccine is
not yet available. New drugs—mostly viral protease inhibitors—were approved
within the last few years by the FDA. Small molecules that might inhibit the viral
replicase are also being explored. The current treatment for chronic HCV is a
combination of protease inhibitors and ribavirin, an older antiviral. Until very
recently, the treatment consisted of a course of pegylated interferon-alpha and
ribavirin. The success rate for this protocol, as measured by a decrease in virus in
the blood to non-detectable limits, is about 30–50 % in Caucasian and Oriental
subjects, but considerably lower in African or African-American subjects [20, 21].
This is in part due to a genetic polymorphism in the IL28 or interferon k gene
[22]. With the new drug regimen, the rate of ‘‘cure’’ is considerably higher, and
with fewer side effects. As in the case of HIV/AIDS, a change in behavior could
affect the HCV rates of infection and reduce the burden on society. The disease is
progressive and eventually affects the liver, in most cases leading to cirrhosis of
8.9

the liver and the need for a liver transplant. There is no evidence of integration of
the viral genome, and since this is an RNA virus, it is located in the cytoplasm or
internal cell membranes. It is hypothesized that carcinomas develop as a result of
stress on the liver, with constant destruction and regeneration of liver tissue.
Complete liver transplant is becoming more common as a treatment; however,
with the advent of new drugs, this disease should be under control in a few years.
Hepatitis B is a DNA virus that also affects the liver. There are possibly 10
times more cases of hepatitis B than hepatitis C in developing or undeveloped
countries, but not in the U.S. The mode of spread is through sexual transmission,
needle-sharing and blood transfusions. This virus is unique in that it goes through a
DNA-RNA-DNA stage, coding for and carrying its own reverse transcriptase. The
hepatitis B DNA can be integrated into the chromosome. It has been suggested that
an HBV protein (X protein) acts on the p53 suppressor, and leads to liver cancer.
However, it is just as likely that cancer is a result of constant damage to the liver
from viral replication—as indicated above for hepatitis C. Unlike the case of
hepatitis C, there is now a very effective vaccine against hepatitis B. This will
certainly cut down on the number of impending cases, although at the moment
both hepatitis C and B present signiﬁcant medical problems for the future. One can
expect to see large increases in liver cancer.

Smallpox
Abstract
It is estimated that smallpox arose in the human population either 16,000 or
68,000 years ago from a rodent source, possibly as two different diseases. The
virus mutated to greater pathogenicity in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, with epidemics in most urban centers of the world. It was a disease
that was endemic in European and Asian populations, but extremely virulent
among the non-immune native populations of the New World. Ninety percent
of the American Indians died as a result of smallpox, leading to the easy
colonization of the American continent by the Spaniards, and later by other
European settlers. The decimation of the Amerindians led to the introduction of
slavery to work the silver and gold mines. Smallpox found an immune ‘‘virgin
population’’ in the Americas, and in other isolated populations. Reasons for this
difference in response to the infection are discussed. Smallpox is the ﬁrst human
infectious viral disease to have been eradicated from the earth; its eradication is
a fascinating history—from variolation to development of a vaccine in the
eighteenth century to complete elimination in 1977.

Origins of Smallpox
Using DNA-sequencing technology and mutational analysis, researchers at the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California and the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta have calculated that the original smallpox virus evolved as a human
disease either 160,000 or 68,000 years ago, depending on whether the African or
Asian virus is used as the basis of the calculation [1]. This virus would have
evolved from an African rodent virus, possibly taterapox. These conclusions are
based on the rate of change that occurred in the viral DNA with time. The wide
discrepancy in dates is due to the use of different clades (sub-groups of virus): one
clade from variola major, the smallpox that occurred in Asia, and the other from a

West African virus, which included alastrim, a less virulent strain of the smallpox
virus. This is much further back in time than expected. Researchers hypothesized
that the virus may have arisen from an intermediate animal host that has disap-
peared completely, possibly an African rodent. The pox viruses are among the
largest known animal viruses, and there has been speculation as to whether they
evolved as other smaller viruses, possibly from the host cell, or are a degeneration
of a more complex organism akin to a bacterium or a protozoan. Since these are
DNA viruses, they undergo mutation at a very slow rate.
Although the time and place of man’s ﬁrst encounter with the smallpox virus
will remain speculative, it is believed that the disease originated in agricultural
settlements in Northeast Africa, China, or the Indus River Valley. It is generally
assumed that viral diseases developed with the formation of agricultural com-
munities after the hunter-gatherer stage of civilization. Writings dating from
3700 B.C. (Egypt) and 1100 B.C. (China), and mummies dating from the 18th
Egyptian Dynasty (1580–1350 B.C.) show evidence of smallpox (Fig. 9.1). DNA
sequence analysis of material from the pockmarks conﬁrmed their origin. Inter-
estingly, smallpox is not mentioned in the Bible or in the writings of Hippocrates
or in other Greek or Roman texts, (unless we assume that the plagues mentioned in
Chap. 1 were due to smallpox), suggesting that the disease was unknown or not
serious in the Middle East a few thousand years ago, except in Egypt. Smallpox
likely spread throughout Southwest Asia by means of trade, conquest, and
exploration. Smallpox became endemic in India in the ﬁrst millennium B.C.; from
India it spread into China in the ﬁrst century A.D. and reached Japan by the sixth

century. It reached Europe during the Middle Ages, most likely when the armies of
Islam passed through North Africa into Spain, or later with the crusaders returning
from the Holy Land.
In China, Ho-Kong (d. 340 A.D.) gave the ﬁrst recognizable description of
smallpox. He describes pockmarks that appear on the body and face, and writes
that these last for a long time even if the person recovers. If the disease is not
treated early. the patients die. However the description of the treatment is rather
puzzling. To quote from a translation from the Chinese, ‘‘If the people boiled
edible mallows, mixed them with garlic, and ate the concoction, the epidemic
would stop. If when contracting the disease one ate this concoction with a small
amount of rice to help it down, this too would effect a cure.’’ The disease was
called ‘‘the Barbarian (or Hun) Pox,’’ since it came from the West after an attack
on Nan-Yang, in central China. ‘‘The Marsh-mallow’’ (not to be confused with the
confectionery marshmallow), an edible weed, has been used for thousands of years
in medicine, and can soothe irritated mucous membranes. Mallows have been used
in the treatment of many illnesses in folk medicine. Adding garlic might have a
medicinal effect, and of course may also prevent contact between people.
In 569 A.D., Marium, Bishop of Avenches, named the agent causing smallpox
‘‘variola,’’ from the Latin varius, meaning ‘‘pimple’’ or ‘‘spotted.’’
It was difﬁcult at that time to distinguish between measles and smallpox, both
fatal diseases. Rhazes (Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi), a ninth-century Persian
physician, was the ﬁrst to differentiate between the two infections. Rhazes was a
physician, philosopher, and mathematician who wrote many books on medicine
and philosophy and is considered the forerunner of modern empiric medicine. He
describes the rash stage of smallpox thus: ‘‘Smallpox appears when blood ‘boils’
and is infected, resulting in vapours being expelled. Thus juvenile blood (which
looks like wet extracts appearing on the skin) is being transformed into richer
blood, having the color of mature wine. At this stage, smallpox shows up essen-
tially as ‘bubbles found in wine’ (as blisters) … this disease can also occur at other
times (i.e., not only during childhood). The best thing to do during this ﬁrst stage is
to keep away from it; otherwise this disease might turn into an epidemic.’’ From
the description of Rhazes and other physicians of the period, it seems that
smallpox was not a dangerous disease. By 1000 A.D. smallpox had spread across
most of Europe and Asia. From the twelfth to fourteenth centuries there were large
movements of peoples, particularly during the Crusades, when armies from Europe
(England, France, and Spain) journeyed to the Middle East and back, thus
spreading disease. We don’t know exactly when smallpox reached Europe—but
we know that ‘‘pox houses’’ were built in the era of the Crusades, along the routes
from Europe to the Holy Land. It’s likely that the movement of armies across
Europe in these years hastened the spread of the disease [2]. Some historians
believe smallpox in the medieval period was just a minor variant of the disease—a
childhood illness like measles, but less severe. It certainly wasn’t feared like the
bubonic plague, but in the 200 years that followed the bubonic plague (Black
Death), smallpox grew more and more deadly. By the sixteenth century it was a
major killer [3].

Origins of Smallpox

Even Girolamo Fracastoro (1478–1553) describes it as an endemic disease, not
one with severe symptoms (it was predominantly a childhood disease). The virus
must have mutated to one with increased virulence sometime in the sixteenth or
seventeenth century. Smallpox was ‘‘endemic’’ throughout Europe—meaning that
it was a constant presence. When the virus reached a dense population with low
immunity, it became ‘‘epidemic,’’ and a major outbreak occurred. Epidemics were
cyclical; with each passing generation, as immunity levels dropped, epidemics
recurred.
9.2
The Effect of Smallpox on European History
Smallpox in Europe (as elsewhere) attacked the rich as well as the poor. It dras-
tically altered European history by destroying the line of succession of many royal
houses (listed in Table 9.1) and it drastically affected everyday life. In 1800,
English historian Thomas Macaulay wrote that the disease ‘‘was always present,
ﬁlling the churchyard with corpses, tormenting with constant fears all whom it had
not yet stricken … making the eyes and cheeks of a betrothed maiden objects of
horror to the lover.’’ Between 1719 and 1746, London suffered ﬁve major
smallpox outbreaks. As the eighteenth century drew to a close, smallpox was
killing 400,000 Europeans each year and had spread from Eurasia to Australia,
South Africa, and North and South America. It replaced the ‘‘black death’’ as the
major scourge of Europe and the rest of the world.
9.3
Effect of Smallpox on the New World
Smallpox had a devastating effect in the Americas where it occurred as a con-
tinuous deadly epidemic. The ﬁrst recorded smallpox outbreak in Latin America
occurred in 1507, when Spanish explorers brought the disease to Hispaniola (today
Haiti and the Dominican Republic). The native population lacked immunity to

smallpox and entire nations were decimated. The population of Hispaniola, esti-
mated anywhere between 300,000 and 1,000,000 in 1492, had decreased to less
than 1000 by 1541. The ﬁrst outbreak of smallpox occurred in 1518 among the
Taino people, who inhabited the Caribbean Islands, including Cuba and Puerto
Rico. By 1550, the Tainos were extinct. In their diaries, both Bartolomé de las
Casas and Columbus describe the Taino as a very gentle, peace-loving, honest
people, not given to the evils of the Spaniards. Bartolomé de las Casas, a Spanish
priest living in Hispaniola at the time (1542) wrote [4]:
There were 60,000 people living on this island [when I arrived in 1508], including the
Indians; so that from 1494 to 1508, over three million people had perished from war,
slavery and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this? And of all the inﬁnite
universe of humanity, these people are the most guileless, the most devoid of wickedness
and duplicity, the most obedient and faithful to their native masters and to the Spanish
Christians whom they serve. They are by nature the most humble, patient, and peaceable,
holding no grudges, free from embroilments, neither excitable nor quarrelsome. These
people are the most devoid of rancors, hatreds, or desire for vengeance of any people in the
world. And because they are so weak and complaisant, they are less able to endure heavy
labor and will soon die of no matter what malady … Yet into this sheepfold, into this land
of meek outcasts there came some Spaniards who immediately behaved like ravening wild
beasts, wolves, tigers, or lions that had been starved for many days. And Spaniards have
behaved in no other way during the past 40 years, down to the present time, for they are
still acting like ravening beasts, killing, terrorizing, afﬂicting, torturing, and destroying the
native peoples, doing all this with the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty,
never seen or heard of before, and to such a degree that this Island of Hispaniola once so
populous (having a population that I estimated to be more than three million), has now a
population of barely two hundred persons … The island of Cuba is nearly as long as the
distance between Valladolid and Rome; it is now almost completely depopulated. San
Juan [Puerto Rico] and Jamaica are two of the largest, most productive and attractive
islands; both are now deserted and devastated.
As is obvious from the above description, not only did the native peoples die
from smallpox, but also from the hardships and cruelty imposed upon them by the
Spaniards. The description of Bartolomé de las Casas is unique in its honesty of
the sufferings imposed on the Indians and of the greed of the Spaniards.
9.4
Smallpox in Mexico
Bernard Diaz del Castillo describes in great detail in his book The True History of
the Conquest of New Spain [5] the war between the Aztecs of Montezuma and the
Spaniards, led by Cortes. As in the case of the writings of Bartolomé de las Casas,
the picture of Montezuma and the Indians is a very sympathetic one. Following the
death of Montezuma, the Spaniards were forced to ﬂee the city and take refuge in
Tlaxcala, and signed a treaty with that tribe to help conquer Tenochtitlan, offering
the Tlaxcalans freedom from any kind of tribute and the control of Tenochtitlan. In
the ensuing battle between the Aztecs and the Spaniards, it is possible that
smallpox was transmitted to the Aztecs, who then died by the thousands. This
included Montezuma’s brother, the new king. The smallpox was possibly brought

to Mexico by a local slave attached to the army of Panﬁlo de Narvaez, who headed
the expedition against Cortes. The disease spread from town to town, resulting in
the abandonment of farms and the starvation of the population. On August 21 the
Spaniards stormed the city, only to ﬁnd that some greater force had already pil-
laged it. ‘‘I solemnly swear that all the houses and stockades in the lake were
full of heads and corpses,’’ Cortes’s chronicler, Bernal Diaz, wrote of the scene.
‘‘It was the same in the streets and courts … We could not walk without treading
on the bodies and heads of dead Indians. I have read about the destruction of
Jerusalem, but I do not think the mortality was greater there than here in Mexico
… Indeed, the stench was so bad that no one could endure it … and even Cortes
was ill from the odors which assailed his nostrils.’’
Historians cite from 2 to 15 million Aztec deaths due to smallpox. It was
claimed that the population of Mexico had shrunk from a population of 25.2
million in 1518 to 1.1 million by 1605 [6]. However, other historians have dis-
puted these numbers as exaggerated. From Mexico, the disease spread both north
and south to the Incas. It appeared in Guatemala in 1520. The disease reached Peru
by 1525 and killed the emperor of the Incas, Huayna Capac, and most of his
family. Following the death of the emperor and his sons, civil war broke out in the
Incan Empire, which was quickly conquered by Pizarro. The smallpox epidemic
was followed by measles, spreading through Mexico and Peru from 1530 to 1531.
Another epidemic (perhaps typhus) followed in 1546, which was followed by an
inﬂuenza epidemic on both sides of the Atlantic in 1556–1560. Reports indicate
that as many as 20 % of the population of Europe and the Americas died during
this epidemic. It may have been similar to the great inﬂuenza epidemic of 1918. By
1630, the Andean population was only about 7 % of what it had been in 1524. Not
only was the population decimated by disease, but also by the conditions in the
silver mines, where harsh conditions led to death. Smallpox moved northward
from Mexico and westward from the eastern United States and Canada. Probably
by the time most settlers arrived in what is now the U.S. and Canada, a large
proportion of the native populations had died off because of smallpox. We do
know that after the French set up a post in Nova Scotia in 1616, a great pestilence
(smallpox?) swept through the Massachusetts Bay area. Thus both the Indians and
the Europeans believed that the ‘‘God of the White Man’’ prepared the way for the
white settlers, By the mid-1800s, smallpox had decimated many Native American
tribes in the United States, Canada, and Alaska (see Table 9.2) [7].
9.5
Smallpox and Slavery
The historical importance of these events should not be underestimated. This
disease ‘‘depopulated’’ most of the Americas and certainly helped in the settlement
of the country by ‘‘white men.’’ Estimates of the total population of North America
before the arrival of Columbus vary from 50 to 100 million. There was also
systematic killing of the native population, either by terrible working conditions in
148

the mines, or by outright massacres. The smallpox epidemics may have brought
about the importation of slaves from other continents, in particular from Africa
since there was no native population to work the land, and the gold and silver
mines of South America. It has been suggested that Africans were more resistant to
smallpox and it is possible that African children were exposed to smallpox as a
childhood infection, survived the infection and thus were immune for life.

Smallpox and Slavery
149

Borges, the famous Argentinian writer, wrote:
In 1517, the Spanish missionary, Bartolomé de las Casas, taking great pity on the Indians
who were languishing in the hellish work pits of the Antillean gold mines, suggested to
King Charles V of Spain, a scheme for importing blacks, so that they might languish in the
hellish work pits of the Antillean gold mines. To this odd philanthropic twist we owe, all
up and down the Americas, endless things.
Although Bartolomé de las Casas did initially advocate the importation of black
slaves to replace the local peoples, he later regretted this decision and was opposed
to slavery. He sympathized with the local Indian population and tried to persuade
the Spanish king to abolish the Enconomendia, which resulted in maltreatment and
slavery of the Indians. He was later appointed Bishop of Chiapas.
One other important result of the smallpox epidemics and plague was the
conversion of the remaining Indians to Christianity. The Aztecs and Incas saw that
the ‘‘white man’’ seemed to be resistant to the smallpox, whereas their people died
by the thousands. Thus the Spaniards’ god seemed much more powerful than the
Aztecs’ or Incas’ gods. Missionaries soon followed the conquistadores and con-
verted a weak and disillusioned population to Christianity. The native Amerin-
dians could not understand what was happening; they were downtrodden, defeated
and humiliated. They readily accepted Christianity, or submitted without resis-
tance, and the religious among them felt that their gods had abandoned them. The
Spaniards and other colonizers did not deliberately, in most cases, introduce
smallpox and other diseases. These diseases, mostly viral, found ‘‘virgin soil’’, i.e.,
a population without immunity and the diseases spread with extreme devastation.
This continued for many generations, although there must have been some
selection for eventual resistance, particularly following intermarriage between
Spanish settlers and local Amerindians (Fig. 9.2).
There was at least one case in which smallpox was used as a biological weapon
against an Indian tribe (Fig. 9.3). General William Amherst of the British army
ordered blankets known to be contaminated with pus from smallpox to be given to
the Indian tribe. Lord Amherst was the commanding general of the British forces

during the French and Indian War (1754–1763); this was the war that acquired
Canada for Britain. Apparently after the defeat of the French, one Indian tribe did
not accept British rule (they expected supplies from the British, as given to them by
the French). Below is a link to a copy of the letter written by Amherst supporting the
use of small pox blankets to get rid of this tribe (see Chap. 22 on biological
warfare). http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/34_41_114_fn.jpeg.
9.6
Why Were Native Peoples More Susceptible
to the Virus?
Why were the native populations so susceptible to smallpox and measles? One
hypothesis is that there had been no selection for immunity in the native popu-
lations. Europeans had lived with plagues and viruses for centuries and had
developed an immunity that allowed for the survival of the ﬁttest. Native peoples
did not live in proximity to their animals (they had very few domestic animals) and
thus had not experienced viral diseases, which were transmitted from domestic
animals to humans. By all accounts, the native peoples were very healthy, even
those living in urban areas. In the case of measles, Europeans had developed
immunity since most (99 %) were exposed to this virus in childhood; it was much
more lethal to adults than to children, and when brought to the New World, or
introduced into native populations, it wrought havoc on the adult population.

9.5
Smallpox and Slavery
151

However, in cases of both measles and smallpox, the mortality rate among the
native peoples was around 90 % while in the European peoples around 10 % [7].
This might imply non-pathogenic exposure of Europeans to the virus early in life,
with resulting immunity—as is the case with many other virus infections.
An explanation for the lack of immunity among the Amerindians may be
simply that their ancestors crossed the Bering Straits from Asia before smallpox
was established as an infectious disease in the human population. It is estimated
that the crossing occurred 21,000–40,000 years ago. This would predate the
development of the smallpox virus, or at least be about the time that the virus
became a human infection. As stated earlier, it is thought that the virus mutated
and became more virulent in the sixteenth century, so that its introduction to an
immune naïve population was devastating. The lethality may have been much
higher than in previous outbreaks. Smallpox epidemics in North America were not
conﬁned to the native population; from 1666 until 1903, numerous outbreaks of
smallpox occurred in the Eastern seaboard cities of the United States. Massa-
chusetts had ﬁve epidemics between 1617 and 1722, and smallpox afﬂicted George
Washington’s troops in 1775 during the Revolutionary War. Historians claim that
the Revolutionary Armies were unable to conquer Canada from the French due to
epidemics of smallpox among the troops [8]. In fact, Washington recalled his
troops from the lines of battle so that they might be variolated before joining a
ﬁghting regiment. The British Army also suffered from smallpox during this period
but they practiced variolation on a larger scale than the Americans.
Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address while suffering from the
early symptoms of smallpox and the disease was rampant among both Union and
Confederate solders. Smallpox continued to be a considerable problem up until the
mid-twentieth century in large parts of Africa and in India. The World Health
Organization estimated in 1967, when the campaign to eradicate small pox was
launched, that there were about 15 million individuals affected annually world-
wide. However, at no time did the death rate in these countries reach the level that
it did among native peoples of the Americas [2].
New research indicates that the Amerindians might be lacking a component of
the adaptive immune response. From studies done on newly discovered tribes of
the Amazon, it appears that the initial immune response to virus might be normal,
but that there is not enough heterogeneity in T-cell or B-cell responses to coun-
teract the invasion of the virus. Thus, there was not enough selection against the
virus, which could then overcome the antibody response by selection for virus
variants. The constant exposure of European and Asian populations to the virus
(and other infectious diseases) may have led to selection for a more heterogeneous
immune response, and that genes involved in resistance were lost in isolated
populations, where these diseases were not rampant. This genetic basis is partly
supported by the observation that genetically mixed children of Spaniards and
native peoples are more resistant to smallpox [9]. On the other hand, the smallpox
virus is relatively stable and does not mutate at a high frequency, so there should
be little selection.

Outbreaks of Smallpox Among Other ‘‘Virgin
Populations:’’ Iceland and the Shetland Islands
One of the best-documented studies of a smallpox epidemic occurred among the
small population of Iceland in the eighteenth century. This epidemic reached
Iceland in 1707, killing about a quarter of the population over the next 2 years. A
previous epidemic had occurred 35 years earlier; thus, all born since then had no
immunity to the disease. The epidemic occurred when an Icelander visiting
Denmark had died of the infection while at sea, and his clothes were sent back to
his home on the island. The smallpox spread very rapidly over the southern and
western parts of the island, and in the course of the epidemic 7,800 inhabitants
died. By 1708 the infection spread to the rest of Iceland and the Isle of Grimsey,
where 33 of 87 inhabitants died. By the spring of 1709 the epidemic was over. It is
estimated that approximately 12,000 inhabitants died of smallpox between 1707
and 1710. The population of the island might have been 50,000 before the epi-
demic began, thus about 25 % of the population died from the viral infection.
The epidemic of 1707 is an example of what transpires in a non-immune
population. Previous epidemics had left a proportion of the population immune,
and thus most deaths occurred in the under-35 age bracket. Most of the victims
were adults of various ages and very few children were affected, but the reason for
this is unknown. This was different from most European epidemics where young
children were the only ones susceptible to the virus, since the disease was endemic
in the population, or in the case of the Amerindians, which can be described as
‘‘virgin soil,’’ where there was no history of previous infection. Iceland was rel-
atively isolated with little contact with the outside world. It also had a small
population, not large enough to sustain a full-blown endemic outbreak. There had
been sporadic outbreaks in the previous two centuries [10].
A curious factor of the Icelandic epidemic was that young children had a milder
form of the disease than young adults. With time, the virus appeared to be less
lethal. The outbreak of 1707 had economic consequences: fewer farmers, and a
resulting loss of livelihood for landlords. Variolation was introduced in Iceland in
1802 by government decree [11].
That smallpox might have become more virulent in the sixteenth and eighteenth
centuries is also suggested by the high mortality that occurred in 1720 on the small
island of Foula in the Shetland Islands of Scotland, with the mortality rate
approaching 90 %. This could have been the result of an isolated population
lacking immunity, as in the case of the New World Indians, or because of
increased virulence of the virus [12].
9.8
Religion, Tradition and Smallpox
As did Europeans until the nineteen-century, Amerindians believed that evil spirits
and/or witches instigated smallpox, and other diseases, for sins committed in the
community against their gods, a superstition that did not differ much from those
9.7

found among other peoples. One of the approaches to warding of the disease was
the construction of the ‘‘sweat lodge.’’ which is similar to Finnish or Russian
saunas. It is not clear whether this was a truly Amerindian custom or learned from
the immigrants. The sweat lodge was used both to cleanse the soul and the body,
and attendance at the lodge was accompanied by incantations to ward off the
smallpox.
As in the case of the Amerindians, other cultures tried to explain the occurrence
of smallpox through religious or superstitious belief. According to legend in Japan,
a smallpox demon or devil, who returned to earth to seek revenge, was blamed as
the cause of the disease. Smallpox devils were said to be afraid of red, and thus
dolls with red clothing were placed near the smallpox victim. In Japan, a red
picture of Tametomo, a twelfth century hero who was reputed to have thwarted a
smallpox demon, was often hung in the rooms of smallpox victims to aid their
recovery. The color red had an ancient and persistent association with smallpox
and was supposed to promote recovery. Many Japanese textbooks on dermatology
stated that exposure to red light alleviated the symptoms of smallpox (Fig. 9.4).

On the island of Okinawa, special music was composed for the shansin, a
precursor of the Japanese samishan (a three-stringed instrument similar to a banjo).
Special songs or poetry were written to appease the smallpox devil, written in the
local language of the Ryukyu Islands and special dances were also created. As in
many other cultures, the color red was associated with ‘‘curing’’ smallpox http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_demon.
In Europe there are records that show that Queen Elizabeth 1 of England, and
King Charles V of France wore red during the period they had smallpox. Queen
Elizabeth was wrapped in a red blanket. This was common in China, India, Turkey
and Georgia; even in Western Africa, the Yoruba god of smallpox, Sopona, was
associated with the color red.
In parts of India, China, Africa and Latin America, sacriﬁces were made to
appease the gods of smallpox. In medieval Europe, prayer and pious living were
recommended as one way to guard against sickness. St. Nicaise of Rheims, a
martyr from the time of the Huns (ﬁfth century) was said to have recovered from
smallpox and became the patron saint of the smallpox victim.

Variolation
In China, and later in Turkey and the rest of the Ottoman Empire, people dis-
covered that exposure to smallpox prevented subsequent infection. Material from
the smallpox wound (pox) was dried and inhaled into the nose. Later, rather than
inhaling through the nose, pus from the open sores of the smallpox victim was
scariﬁed onto the arm or another part of the body. In most cases this resulted in a
mild infection of smallpox, making the person ‘‘immune’’ to subsequent disease,
although in 2–3 % of the cases, it could be harmful. In 1713, Emanuel Timoni, a
physician, published an account of the practice in the Philosophical Transactions
of the Royal Society in London, and in 1716, Jacob Pylarini, a Venetian physician
and consul in Smyrna, Turkey, published a further account in the same journal. He
variolated the children of the British Ambassador and was one of the ﬁrst to
practice variolation outside Turkey. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, wife of the
British ambassador to Turkey, who herself had been a victim of smallpox at the
age of 26, brought the practice of variolation to Britain and the British Royal Court
(Fig. 9.5). In 1717, while in Turkey, she learned about variolation and initially had
her 6-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter ‘‘variolated’’ despite opposition from
her husband and the British consulate, who thought it a ‘‘heathen’’ act. Mary
Montagu’s children did not come down with smallpox.
Variolation was much discussed in London, and this discussion must have
encouraged Lady Montagu to take a bold step. She convinced the English court,
including Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales (later Queen of England during
the reign of George II) to variolate her daughter. By 1721, variolation (then called
then ‘‘engrafting’’) began to be widely practiced in Europe as protection against
smallpox. On returning to Britain, she urged the British court to try variolation
by introducing pus from a pock onto the skin of a group of six prisoners and
9.8

abandoned children as a trial run. Dr. Charles Maitland, the court surgeon, per-
formed variolation under the watchful eye of the Royal Society. Subsequently
exposing these subjects to the smallpox virus showed that variolation worked, as
they did not become ill with the virus [13]. Maitland subsequently published a
book describing these and other successful variolations. Such experiments could
not be carried out today in most countries, and in fact it would be difﬁcult to
develop a vaccine against smallpox under present-day restrictions on the use of
human subjects for medical purposes since there is no animal model for smallpox
(Fig. 9.5).

Smallpox

Variolation in the U.S. followed a different pathway. During an outbreak of
smallpox in Boston in 1706, Cotton Mather learned from one of his slaves
(Onesimus) about variolation. He then read Dr. Timoni’s paper published in the
Philadelphia Transaction [13]. He published and introduced the procedure into the
colonies and then tried to convince physicians of the need to perform variolation in
Boston. One of them, Zabdiel Boylston of Brookline, variolated his 6-year-old-
son, his 30-year-old slave, and the slave’s 2-year-old son. In 1721 Boston was hit
with an epidemic that afﬂicted about 50 % of the city’s 11,000 inhabitants and
killed 844. By 1722 Boylston had variolated 242 of his patients, of whom only six
died during the epidemic. This was a mortality rate of 2.5 % compared to 15–20 %
among the non-variolated population. Boylston reported these results in the Boston
Gazette. However, variolation was opposed by the medical establishment and the
clergy, and even the general public, and Boylston had to go into hiding [14].
(Boylston Street, a major thoroughfare in Boston, is not named after him, but after
one of his descendants, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist.)
Both the British Army and the Revolutionary Forces during the American War
of Independence widely used variolation, since both sides suffered terribly from
outbreaks of smallpox in their respective armies. Documents indicate that in 1777
George Washington ordered the return to Philadelphia of solders in his army to
receive smallpox variolation since smallpox was rampant in the revolutionary
army. The British had vaccinated their troops, and the story is that they sent
variolated civilians to mix with the colonists in the hope of spreading the disease.
In 1776, the British did it again as the Americans besieged Quebec City. It is told
that this time they variolated prostitutes and sent them among the troops; half of
the 10,000 Americans fell ill, and after burying their dead in mass graves, they
retreated in disorder from the colony, which remained in British hands [14].
One of the puzzling aspects of variolation is why taking material from pus and
infecting an individual with this was not as severe as the natural infection.
However, variolation could result in devastating effects, and about 2–3 % of those
treated in this fashion did die, yet this was ten times less than the effect of
smallpox. It could be that due to scariﬁcation of the skin—rather than inhalation—
the disease was less severe.
9.10
Jenner’s Vaccination
Local English farmers had observed for some time that milkmaids often had sores
(pockmarks) on their hands, which prevented smallpox from developing. This
appeared to be due to ‘‘cowpox’’ transmitted from cows during milking. In fact,
many farmers inoculated their families with cowpox, and the story went around
that this could protect against smallpox. In 1792, as a country physician in
Gloucestershire, Edward Jenner noted this phenomenon and decided to ‘‘scarify’’
James Phipps, a local 8-year-old boy, with the cowpox, and subsequently expose
him to pus from a smallpox lesion; James proved resistant to the subsequent

smallpox infection. This method of protection was called ‘‘vaccination’’ from the
Latin ‘‘vacca’’ meaning ‘‘cow’’ (Fig. 9.6). Jenner was also a naturalist and studied
cuckoo behavior; he published a paper on the natural history of the cuckoo, and
was a member of the British Royal Society. Despite this, the society refused to
publish his observations on cowpox as a preventative of smallpox. Luckily for
mankind, Jenner independently published a pamphlet ‘‘An inquiry into the causes
and effects of the variola vaccine, a disease discovered in some of the western
counties of England, particularly Gloucestershire, and known by the name of
cowpox.’’ In this, he described the results from 20 patients who developed
immunity to smallpox after cowpox inoculation.
Although some accepted this work, the medical establishment ridiculed it—in
particular the clergy who proclaimed it an interference with God’s way. Others
claimed that it was not mentioned in the Bible (neither was smallpox), and that it
was a ﬁlthy habit. Despite this campaign, Jenner’s pamphlet was widely read and
the practice of vaccination spread all over the world. He was honored with letters
and awards from President Thomas Jefferson, from the Chiefs of the Five Nations
of the North American Indians, and from Napoleon, who released prisoners at
Jenner’s request [15]. (More details can be found in Chap. 19 on vaccines.)
The cowpox virus used was later called ‘‘vaccinia.’’ This method, and possibly
the same original virus with some modiﬁcation (vaccinia), was used until very
recently to prevent smallpox epidemics. Such experimentation would never pass

an institutional medical review board today, nor would the subsequent experi-
mentation on prisoners conﬁrming that smallpox vaccination worked. Although
vaccination was effective, it took about another 200 years for it to be universally
accepted. Smallpox was only totally eradicated in 1977.
The acceptance of vaccination was not easy. Many people fought against it,
claiming that it was interfering with the work of God; others made fun of the idea
that material from a cow could protect humans. There are many cartoons from
the eighteenth century that ridicule the concept of variolation and vaccination.
Anti-vaccination societies became especially vocal during the late nineteenth
century, and many anti-vaccinators believed that vaccination was, as George
Bernard Shaw put it, a ‘‘ﬁlthy piece of witchcraft’’ that did more harm than good.
9.11
Eradication of Smallpox
The eradication of smallpox is one of the all-time greatest achievements in
medicine. A Russian epidemiologist, Victor Zhdanov, the vice-minister of the
Soviet Ministry of Health proposed in 1958 at the UN and World Health
Assembly the total eradication of the smallpox virus. Initially there was much
skepticism expressed as to whether this was achievable. The WHO, a branch of
the United Nations, selected Dr. Donald A. Henderson of the CDC—Atlanta to
co-ordinate the effort and head the WHO’s Smallpox Eradication Unit from its
inception in 1966 until the ﬁnal case in 1977. Henderson was the driving force
behind the whole program. Initially very little funding was allocated to this
project, since large amounts of funding went to an anti-malaria program that
seemed more promising. In fact, the anti-smallpox program may have been the
result of rivalry between the Soviet Union and the U.S. at the United Nations.
Despite this, in 1966 a medical team under the supervision of the WHO set out
for Central and Western Africa, armed with smallpox vaccine and special jet
injectors. It was to become history’s most extensive microbe hunt, encompassing
India, Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and South
America. Teams were dispatched to known sources of epidemics to carry out
mass vaccination, but instead of mass vaccination, a program of surveillance and
eradication was introduced. Infected individuals were tracked down and anyone
having contact with them was vaccinated. This was more efﬁcient than mass
vaccination, although the approach was initially controversial. This idea was the
brainchild of Dr. William Foege, who had been working as a medical missionary
for the Lutheran Church in Eastern Nigeria when the eradication program began;
he now works for the Carter Center in Atlanta. Dr. Foege was the architect of
Surveillance containment isolating areas of outbreak and then vaccinating there.
This freed health workers from the burden of mass vaccination and preserved the
often limited supplies of vaccine.
By 1975, it appeared that the campaign was successful and that smallpox had
been eradicated. The last naturally occurring case of the disease was traced to
Somalia on October 26, 1977, to Ali Maow Maalin from the town of Merka; he
9.10
Jenner’s Vaccination
159

survived the infection. The total eradication of smallpox was not easy in the ﬁeld.
Many believed that we could not eliminate an organism without affecting the total
ecology of human life. There were many practical problems; one was the sur-
veillance and reporting of cases, particularly in Third World countries where there
was little means of communication. Some countries posed particular problems
since there were on-going civil wars, such as in the Congo. The size of the area
covered meant that local teams had to communicate and travel long distances.
Even after eradication, one had to follow up rumors of possible outbreaks and test
for the presence of virus and cases.
Unfortunately, the case of Ali Maow Maalin was not the last. There was a
localized outbreak of smallpox in Birmingham, England, in 1978 due to a lab
accident a lab technician—not associated with the smallpox research laboratory—
died. Janet Parker, a 40-year-old medical photographer who was working on the
ﬂoor above a smallpox laboratory contracted the disease. It has never been con-
clusively determined how the virus reached her, but an ofﬁcial inquiry cited an air
duct between the two ﬂoors as the most likely conduit. Unbelievably, another
medical photographer working in the same room had come down with smallpox
12 years earlier. As a result of Janet Parker’s illness, close to 300 people who’d
come in contact with her had to be quarantined. Among those, only her mother
contracted smallpox and she survived.
Despite this, in 1980 the World Health Assembly recommended that all
countries cease vaccination, and declared that smallpox had been eradicated.
A WHO expert committee recommended that all laboratories destroy their stocks
of variola virus or transfer them to one of two WHO reference laboratories—the
Institute of Virus Preparations in Moscow, or the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. The decision was to be made in the future whether to
destroy all stockpiles or retain samples at these sites for future research.
Why was it possible to eradicate smallpox so successfully but not other viruses?
The principal reason was that smallpox infects only one host, and that is man.
There is no smallpox reservoir in other animals. The vaccine is easy to prepare and
store and does not require refrigeration. Many other vaccines (such as the polio
vaccine) require refrigeration, which is not possible in many counties and certainly
not in the ‘‘bush.’’ The smallpox infection is easy to diagnose and is only infec-
tious during the eruption phase, unlike measles and other viruses that can be
infectious before the rash appears; also, the vaccine confers immunity for
approximately 10 years. Today the population of the world has no immunity to
this disease. However, with the virus having been eliminated, this should not have
posed a problem, but it is now known that there is danger lurking. The stocks of
the virus sit in two freezers and can be restored to life. We do not know whether
they are not stockpiled elsewhere and could be used by a fanatical terrorist. As
discussed below (see Chap. 22), smallpox virus was prepared in liter amounts for
biological warfare purposes, despite a treaty that was supposed to prevent this
development.

Natural Resistance to Smallpox
In any model of epidemiology, one would expect a resistant population to arise.
Smallpox has been endemic for close to 16,000 years. In most of the world, children
have been the main victims, hence there should have been some selection among the
survivors for genetic markers that endow resistance. Yet, the evidence for this is
scant. Although AIDS has only been with us for a relatively short time, we already
know that individuals lacking certain chemokine receptors are resistant to the virus.
Some research has been done in this area [16]; in 1965–1966, scientists studied the
incidence and survivors among 415 unvaccinated survivors of smallpox in a Bengali
population. They reported that people who were blood type A were seven times
more likely to be infected by smallpox, three times more likely to have a severe
infection, and two times more likely to die from the disease than those of other blood
types. However, these results have not been conﬁrmed by other researchers.
It has been suggested [17] that the high frequency of the ccr-5-D32 deletion that
confers resistance to HIV infection (CCR-5 is a co-receptor for HIV) in the
European population may have been selected in the human population as a result
of conferring resistance to smallpox. Obviously there has not been enough time for
HIV selection in the human population, since HIV is a relatively new disease.
Others have argued that this allele may have resulted in resistance to the bubonic
plague (Black Death). However, given that smallpox is an older infection, Alison
Galvani and Montgomery Slatkin [17] make the case for smallpox as the selective
agent. In fact, the evidence contradicts the hypothesis that there is a relationship
between bubonic plague and the incidence of ccr-5 deletion. Since one cannot do
experiments on a non-human system, it is impossible to state categorically which
of these hypotheses is correct.
9.13
Smallpox as Weapon of Mass Destruction
Unfortunately, smallpox has been considered again as a possible biological
weapon. Populations today are no longer vaccinated and are thus susceptible to
infection. Smallpox vaccination was stopped in the U.S. and most of Europe in
1980. Ken Alibek, a defector from the Soviet Union, reported that beginning in
1980, the Soviet government embarked on a successful program to produce the
smallpox virus in large quantities and adapted it for use in bombs and intercon-
tinental ballistic missiles; the program had an industrial capacity capable of pro-
ducing many tons of smallpox annually [18]. If used as a biological weapon,
smallpox would represent a serious threat to civilian populations because of its
case-fatality rate of 30 % or more among unvaccinated persons. There is no
proven therapy against the virus. It may be necessary to revaccinate the entire
population, since there are no drugs to counteract a smallpox epidemic. This virus
is also a potential weapon in the hands of a terrorist, even one contemplating a
painful suicide. The few side effects and few cases of smallpox resulting from
vaccination do not justify the complete stoppage, since very shortly (if not
9.12
Natural Resistance to Smallpox
161

already), the total population will have lost immunity and may share the fate of the
American–Indian if an attack with the virus occurs. The population of the world is
on ‘‘virgin soil’’—as far as the infection is considered.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. government took
further actions to improve its level of preparedness against a biological terror
attack. One of many such measures—designed speciﬁcally to prepare for an
intentional release of the smallpox virus—included updating and releasing a
smallpox response plan. In addition, the U.S. government has prepared enough
vaccine to vaccinate every person in the United States in the event of a smallpox
emergency. In the event of a single terror attack, one would need a hundred million
doses of vaccine. Until recently, injecting the ‘‘vaccinia’’ virus into the bellies of
calves and harvesting material from the developing lesions produced the vaccine.
This vaccine is derived from the New York City Board of Health strain of vac-
cinia, and then essentially freeze-dried for storage. It was licensed by the FDA in
1931 but is no longer manufactured. ACAM2000, a ‘‘second-generation’’ smallpox
vaccine, is derived from a clone of the original vaccinia virus, puriﬁed, and pro-
duced, using modern cell culture technology. Large amounts of the vaccine can be
produced as required. The question of whether to keep or destroy the remaining
vials of smallpox still haunts us, and the argument in favor is the possible need to
study the pathology of the virus. However, vaccinia—the virus used in inocula-
tion—which is probably not the original cowpox isolated by Jenner, could function
as an alternative model.
9.14
The Pox Viruses
The variola virus causes smallpox. It only infects humans and has no known
animal reservoir. Transmission is by airborne droplets and contact with the pus
from lesions; under some circumstances, coughing can spread the virus. The
maximum infectious period is 7–10 days after the appearance of the rash. It is
highly contagious, and is carried in clothing and blankets. Figure 9.7 illustrates the
progression of the virus, with the development of blisters all over the skin.
Immunity is relatively long-lasting although there is some controversy as to how
long it lasts. The vaccine is easy to produce, and relatively inexpensive, and can
also be stored in its dry form without the need for refrigeration.
Variola is one of the largest known viruses. It has a ‘‘strawberry-like’’ shape with
an internal core often described as dumbbell-shaped (Fig. 9.8). It contains enough
DNA to code for hundreds of genes. Many of the viral genes code for proteins that
mimic interferon, cytokines, cytokine receptors, complement proteins, and compo-
nents of the normal immune system; these ‘‘decoys’’ interrupt normal cellular pro-
cesses. This virus, unlike most other viruses, contains genes that code for enzymes
involved in its own DNA and RNA synthesis. After attachment, the virus undergoes
phagocytosis, and the outer membrane is removed in the cytoplasm of the infected
cell. Unlike most DNA viruses, smallpox replicates in the cytoplasm, since it has
genetic information for its own replicating enzymes.

The Pox Viruses
163

The poxviruses form a large class of viruses that affect man, although smallpox
is the major agent. Other viruses include vaccinia and cowpox (perhaps the same
virus originally used in vaccination), monkeypox (which has symptoms similar to
smallpox in humans), molluscum contagiosum, which gives rise to benign tumors,
and orf, a disease transmitted from sheep. There are poxviruses that infect other
animals, one of which, myxoma, was used to control the rabbit population in
Australia, and is a good example of how a pathogenic virus can adapt to its host
(and how the host adapts to the virus).

Yellow Fever
Abstract
Other than smallpox, perhaps no disease has inﬂuenced major events shaping
the development of North and Central America than yellow fever. This fatal
disease—with 50 % mortality—destroyed the economies of many Southern
American cities. Yellow fever inhibited the attempts of the French to establish
an empire in the Western Hemisphere, using Haiti as a base. This resulted in the
sale of the Louisiana Territories to the U.S., resulting in doubling the size of the
country. Attempts to build a canal across the Isthmus of Panama failed because
of disease, and yellow fever killed more troops in Cuba than were casualties of
hostilities in the Spanish–American War. These events led to the formation of a
U.S. commission, headed by Walter Reed, to investigate the causes of yellow
fever. Carlos Finlay, a Cuban scientist, had suggested some 20 years before the
establishment of the commission, that mosquitoes transmitted yellow fever.
This was tragically conﬁrmed when two members of the commission allowed
themselves to be bitten by yellow fever-loaded mosquitoes. One died and the
other suffered chronic illness. Reed established a camp with volunteers to test
the hypothesis and proved without a doubt that the insects spread the disease.
Later commissions conﬁrmed these results and a virus was eventually isolated,
although not without other casualties among the researchers. Max Theiler, at
the Rockefeller Institute, developed a vaccine which is used to this day.
Outbreaks of yellow fever still occur in Africa and areas of South America.

Introduction
Other than smallpox, perhaps no disease has inﬂuenced major events shaping the
development of North and Central America than yellow fever. High fever, chills,
headache, back pain, nausea and general fatigue accompany acute yellow fever. In
more severe cases there is bleeding, jaundice, and eventual shock and death, with

the mortality rate about 20–50 %. This disease has struck within North America
numerous times, and its origins were blamed on everything from rotting coffee
beans to bad sanitation and ﬁlth.
The disease was also known as ‘‘Yellow Jack’’ because of the ﬂying of the
yellow ﬂag of quarantined ships. The yellow was associated with a custom of
placing patients in jackets with yellow patches to separate them from other patients
in a hospital in Greenwich, London. A yellow ﬂag was also hoisted where there
were cases of yellow fever [1, 2]. Was this the disease described in the ‘‘Rime of
the Ancient Mariner?’’ Yellow fever disrupted the economic development of the
American South, almost ruining the growth of cities like New Orleans and
Memphis. The focus here is on America, since it was here that the origins of the
disease were ﬁrst discovered, but it also affected many European seaports and had
a particularly devastating effect on African countries.
In the Americas, the disease was the precursor to historical events of major
consequence: The slave revolt in Haiti led to yellow fever infections among the
French troops sent to suppress the revolt to such an extent that Napoleon did not
believe it possible to build an empire in North America. The disastrous failure of the
initial attempts to build the Panama Canal due to the lethal effects of this illness on
engineers and workers alike, led to its abandonment and later in the twentieth
century to the U.S. building of the canal. The deaths of thousands of American
troops in Cuba led to the establishment of a commission of investigation and to the
discovery of the mosquito as the vector of the disease [3]. The story of the research
to discover the means of transmission of this disease reads like a detective novel in
which many of the major players are victims of the disease itself.
10.2
Origins of Yellow Fever
Whether yellow fever originated in Africa, or was transmitted to Africa from
tropical America, remains controversial. Evidence from pre-Columbian texts
indicates that a disease related to yellow fever occurred in tropical America before
1491. However, it was more likely another hemorrhagic fever—of which there are
many—and not yellow fever. A plague ascribed to yellow fever destroyed the
Mayans of the Yucatan Peninsula in 1648. However, again there is disagreement
as to whether this was yellow fever or some other disease with similar symptoms.
The ﬁrst cases recorded in Africa also date to the seventeenth century [4]. After
that date, yellow fever and smallpox replaced the Black Death as the major dis-
eases afﬂicting the Americas and parts of Europe and Africa. The Aedes aegypti
mosquito is of African origin, since no related species are found in the Western
hemisphere; this strain of mosquito probably arrived in the Americas in slave ships
from West Africa. The virus can persist in mosquito eggs for a long time.
Recent phylogenetic studies using RNA sequence analysis of the pre-membrane
gene and part of the envelope gene of a collection of yellow fever viruses, isolated
over time and from various locations, indicate that the virus evolved in Africa
166
10
Yellow Fever

about 1,500 years ago [5]. This study indicated that the virus began in East Africa,
moved to West Africa, and eventually crossed the ocean. Four unique ‘‘clades’’ of
the virus were discovered, two in Africa (East and West) and two in the Americas.
The rate of nucleotide change is as expected for a typical RNA virus. Estimates
indicate that the virus was introduced into the Americas about 300–400 years ago,
conﬁrming its African origin. It remained a major scourge of the West Indies, both
protecting them from invasion by outsiders as well as killing off large segments of
the community; between 1853 and 1900 it killed 36,000 people in Havana alone.
To this day, yellow fever is endemic to Central and South America and West
Africa, and it exists among tree-living monkeys in the forests as ‘‘Sylvan (jungle)
Yellow Fever,’’ and is spread by different strains of mosquitoes (Aedes in Africa,
and Haemagogus in South America). In urban settings it is spread mostly by Aedes
aegypti. This species of mosquito is very widespread, and prefers an urban envi-
ronment, living in pools of water near homes, in abandoned tires, and anywhere
that water accumulates. The World Health Organization estimates that there are
about 200,000 cases of yellow fever annually, with 30,000 deaths, 90 % of which
occur in Africa. West Africa is particularly badly hit due to a breakdown in
vaccination and mosquito control. It is now considered a re-emerging virus, with
East Africa as well as West Africa being in danger.
10.3
Yellow Fever and Slavery
One of the suggested reasons for the slave trade from Africa to the Americas was
the resistance of the African to yellow fever. However, there is no evidence of
immunity in the African population. Yellow fever outbreaks have occurred a
number of times in West Africa in the last century and well into this century. In
1986, an epidemic broke out among a widely scattered population in Eastern
Nigeria; some 10,000 people, out of an estimated regional population of 200,000,
suffered ‘‘clinical’’ illness, with more than 5,000 deaths. In 1987 another major
epidemic broke out in Western Nigeria: there were 120,000 cases and 24,000
deaths. In 1995, yellow fever re-emerged in epidemic form in Senegal with a case
fatality rate of 18.9 %.
Since 2001 there have been large outbreaks in ﬁve major African cities. The
origin was sylvatic—that is, spread from monkeys or other primates to humans
through mosquitoes. Thus in modern times, Africans are as susceptible to yellow
fever as other races, although the death rate is less than in the Caucasian popu-
lation. If Africans were immune a few hundred years ago, at the time of the slave
trade, this immunity would have been transmitted to future generations. Perhaps a
more reasonable explanation is that yellow fever is endemic to West Africa, and
children are exposed to the virus at a young age, with resulting acquired immunity.
As in the case of polio, childhood yellow fever may be asymptomatic in the
majority of cases, and thus the adult population would be immune. Evidence for
this hypothesis is that a high percentage of children in some areas of Africa have

antibodies to yellow fever, indicating early exposure to the virus. There is no
evidence of genetic selection for resistance, although that may have occurred in the
case of other diseases, such as resistance to malaria (sickle-cell hemoglobin). In
fact, one can look at the importation of Black Africans as a decision imposed by
the economy of the colonial plantations. Sheldon Watts argues that the idea that
Africans were immune to yellow fever derives from racial stereotypes, developed
in the plantations of North and South America, since there was little yellow fever
among plantation workers [6]. If there was exposure to the virus while the child
was young, there may have been acquired immunity. Yellow fever was predom-
inantly an urban disease, and not a disease usually found in the countryside [7].

Yellow Fever in North America
Table 10.1 presents the dates and duration of yellow fever outbreaks since the
earliest dates recorded. Individual outbreaks are discussed.
10.4.1 Philadelphia
In the U.S. and Canada, yellow fever struck major cities every few years. This
included northern cities as far north as Halifax, and Savannah and New Orleans in
the south. Philadelphia suffered outbreaks in 1699, 1741, 1747, 1762 and the 1793
epidemic, which killed about 10 % of the population. The city at that time had a
population of about 50,000, and was the functioning seat of government (Wash-
ington as the capital was in the planning stages). The outbreak correlated with the
inﬂux of large numbers of refugees from the Caribbean ﬂeeing the local epidemic
on the islands. It was a hot summer, and there were lots of mosquitoes. The
outbreak came to an end with the ﬁrst frost, which, in hindsight, should have
alerted the medical establishment to the fact that the disease correlated with an
insect or other living form unable to over winter.
Dr. Benjamin Rush (1746–1813), one of the signatories of the Declaration of
Independence and an important physician, urged people to leave the city. For most
of his life, he practiced and taught in Philadelphia and helped establish the city as a
center for medical training. Rush set up the Philadelphia Dispensary for medical
relief for the poor, which was the ﬁrst institution of its kind in the United States.
He also helped found the College of Physicians of Philadelphia.

This booklet describes the attention taken by a group of black men and women
in caring for the sick in Philadelphia during the epidemic. Many of them also
caught the disease, although it was believed by the white population that they were
immune. The booklet was a response to accusations made in a publication that they
had ‘‘over-charged’’ for their services. From this publication, we get a picture of
the panic and horrors of this epidemic, where people died faster than their bodies
could be picked up, the neglect of children, and abandonment of the dying.
African-Americans died from the disease at the same rate as Americans of
European descent. The following is a description from Samuel Beck, a merchant of
the city.
Yellow Fever Attacks Philadelphia, 1793.
Eye Witness to History, www.eyewitnesstohistory.com
‘‘I had scarcely become settled in Philadelphia when in July, 1793, the yellow fever broke
out, and, spreading rapidly in August, obliged all the citizens who could remove to seek
safety in the country. My father took his family to Bristol on the Delaware, and in the last
of August I followed him… I was compelled to return to the city on the 8th of September,
and spend the 9th there. Everything looked gloomy, and forty-ﬁve deaths were reported
for the 9th. And yet it was nothing then to what it became three or four weeks later, when
from the ﬁrst to the twelfth of October one thousand persons died. On the twelfth a smart
frost came and checked its ravages.
The horrors of this memorable afﬂiction were extensive and heart rending. Nor were
they softened by professional skill. The disorder was in a great measure a stranger to our
climate, and was awkwardly treated. Its rapid march, being from ten victims a day in
August to one hundred a day in October, terriﬁed the physicians, and led them into
contradictory modes of treatment. They, as well as the guardians of the city, were taken by
surprise. No hospitals or hospital stores were in readiness to alleviate the sufferings of the
poor. For a long time nothing could be done other than to furnish cofﬁns for the dead and

men to bury them. At length a large house in the neighborhood was appropriately ﬁtted up
for the reception of patients, and a few pre-eminent philanthropists volunteered to
superintend it. At the head of them was Stephen Girard, who has since become the richest
man in America.
In private families the parents, the children, the domestics lingered and died, frequently
without assistance. The wealthy soon ﬂed; the fearless or indifferent remained from
choice, the poor from necessity. The inhabitants were reduced thus to one-half their
number, yet the malignant action of the disease increased, so that those who were in health
one day were buried the next. The burning fever occasioned paroxysms of rage which
drove the patient naked from his bed to the street, and in some instances to the river, where
he was drowned. Insanity was often the last stage of its horrors.
10.4.2 Memphis
After the abolition of slavery, and the cessation of the slave trade in the North,
yellow fever retreated from the northern cities, where it had previously been
endemic. However, it continued in the southern states, perhaps with more fury.
One of the best reported epidemics occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1878 [7].
That year there had been a very wet winter in West Africa, with an outbreak of
yellow fever among the monkeys of the area. Ships sailed to New Orleans, not
necessarily with slaves, but with other precious cargoes and mosquitoes. That year,
a year of the El Niño cycle, also brought wet weather and hot temperatures to the
south—ideal weather for breeding mosquitoes. Memphis was at the peak of its
prosperity, being a major port for cotton and a major port for the importation of
slaves. However, it was one of the ﬁlthiest cities in the Americas, situated in a
swamp, lacking sanitation, and a non-functioning city government (http://
historic-memphis.com/memphis/yellow-fever/yellow-fever.html).
Ships
from
West Africa would stop at New Orleans and then continue on to Memphis.
Although the city of Memphis quarantined any ship suspected of carrying pas-
sengers with yellow fever, some did get through by bypassing the quarantine.
There had been many outbreaks of yellow fever in the city, but the one of 1,878
took the highest toll on lives (Table 10.1). Whoever could afford it, abandoned the
city. Twenty-ﬁve thousand people ﬂed, and of the remaining 17,500, over 5,000
died. The city government collapsed, the police force was decimated, and there
was a shortage of food.
The only people who went out were the collectors of the dead. With horse and wagon, they
shouted ‘Bring out your dead!’ And then they loaded and took all to the cemetery for a
hasty burial. They believed that corpses spread the disease so they tried to get them in the
ground as quickly as possible. They also thought the disease was spread by bad air. So
with temperatures close to 100, they boarded up their windows and kept ﬁres burning to
ward off the outside air. When people died, their clothing and beds were dragged into the
streets and burned. Names of the dead were written in ink in leather-bound ledgers. There
was an average of 200 deaths per day and corpses were everywhere. Half of those who
died were the Irish. Sixteen Catholic priests and 30 sisters died in their heroic battle to tend
the sick. (http://historic-memphis.com/memphis/yellow-fever/yellow-fever.html)

Yellow Fever

The 1878 epidemic—the last great one on American soil—changed the face of
Memphis forever. A new and different population replaced those who had left the
city, and the city lost its place as the major southern port after the epidemic [7]
(Table 10.2).
10.5
The Louisiana Purchase
Perhaps the greatest effect of yellow fever, and an indirect one, was the events
leading to the purchase of the Louisiana Territories by the United States. These
territories included much more than the present state of Louisiana—they included
a large swath of land stretching from New Orleans to Montana, along the Mis-
sissippi River (see Fig. 10.1). France had surrendered its North American pos-
sessions to Spain at the end of the French and Indian War. New Orleans and
Louisiana west of the Mississippi were transferred to Spain in 1762, and French
territories east of the Mississippi, including Canada, were ceded to Britain the next
year. In 1798 the French retook the island of Saint Domingo (Haiti) from the
British. The British had occupied the Saint Domingo in 1793 in part to put down a
slave rebellion and to control buccaneers preying on European ships. Between
1793 and 1798, about 70 % of the British troops succumbed to disease, predom-
inantly yellow fever. This was the primary reason for abandoning the island, as
well as the victory of Toussaint L’Ouverture and the slave uprising, which abol-
ished slavery in Haiti (More details on the Louisiana Purchase can be found at
http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/louisiana-purchase).
Napoleon, who came to power in 1799, aimed to restore France’s presence on
the continent. Napoleon aspired to develop a French empire on North and Central
American territory, based on the island of Haiti. He accepted the Louisiana Ter-
ritory from Spain in exchange for Spain’s gaining a province in Italy. However, the
port of New Orleans remained in Spanish hands, and during the Spanish period the
U.S. used the Mississippi River and New Orleans quite freely. A second slave
revolt broke out in Haiti in 1802, led by Toussaint L’Ouverture. France sent a large
army of as many as 80,000 men, including a 5,200-man Polish Legion to suppress
the revolt. The French also sent a large ﬂeet, one of the largest ever assembled.
However, although they were initially victorious over the slave revolt, the French

troops began to die in droves from yellow fever. Estimates are that as many as
50,000 French troops died from the epidemic in one year, in 1802. L’Ouverture
tied the French troops down in the swampy areas, aware that there was a high
incidence of disease in these areas particularly affecting newly arrived French
troops. The new leader of the slave revolt, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, declared the
island independent and changed its name to Haiti, Taino for ‘‘Land of High
Mountains,’’ on the defeat of the French forces in 1803 [8].
Napoleon realized that his dream of building a western empire was impractical,
since he required large sums of money for his ﬁght against Britain and his wars in
Europe. He felt that these colonies could never be settled—because of disease.
Thus in 1803 he offered the territories to the United States, and the U.S. gov-
ernment was taken by surprise. Jefferson had authorized a negotiating team that
included James Monroe, to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and adjoining
land for $10,000,000. However, the French were willing to part with all of the
Louisiana territory for $15,000,000. This was an area about half the size of the
U.S.: 827,000 square miles. Although there was some opposition by the Feder-
alists, congress approved the purchase in 1803 (Fig. 10.1).
10.6
The Spanish-American War
In 1880, the Department of the Navy appointed a commission to look into the
cause of an outbreak of yellow fever on board the USS Plymouth. This was a case
where multiple outbreaks occurred over the span of a year onboard ships. The
commission concluded that the disease was caused by a germ, possibly picked up
in the ports of call (St. Thomas, Santa Cruz) and brought on board by supplies
purchased in these ports. The commission also concluded that although yellow

Yellow Fever

fever was a germ, it was not infectious in the sense that smallpox was contagious,
but appeared to be related to speciﬁc places and climates. They proposed that it
might be related to certain plant growths. Although the relationship between
malaria and mosquitoes was studied at this time, there was no attempt to relate the
disease to an insect vector. One has to ask why for some 20 years or even earlier,
no attempt was made to conﬁrm the theory of Carlos Finlay, that the mosquito was
involved in the transmission of the disease. Was this because Congress was
unwilling to spend money on research into the cause of the disease until there was
a military threat to the U.S.?
During the Spanish-American War of 1898, more soldiers died of disease,
including typhoid and yellow fever, than from military action. The U.S. declared
war against Spain following an accidental explosion on the USS Maine that killed
268 American sailors. The U.S. government blamed the Spanish government for the
explosion and launched the Spanish-American War. Cuba, a Spanish colony, was at
that time a major source of disease. Epidemics of yellow fever in Cuba date back to
1649 when approximately 30 % of the population died from the disease. There were
subsequent outbreaks every summer. U.S. troops should never have been sent into
the tropics, certainly not in the summer. They landed in June of 1898. Although
then-Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt was aware of the danger, and warned
his commanders, ‘‘If we are kept here it will in all human possibility mean an
appalling disaster, for the surgeons here estimate that over half the army, if kept
here during the sickly season, will die.’’ Despite the warning, troops stayed in Cuba
until the defeat of the Spaniards in July of that year. Fewer than 400 American
soldiers died in combat during the war, but more than 2,000 contracted yellow fever
during the campaign. On July 6, in the town of Siboney, the ﬁrst case of yellow
fever among U.S. troops occurred. Yellow fever began to spread, with ofﬁcers and
doctors blaming it on infected buildings in Siboney, the town in which the
American troops were garrisoned. In response, General Nelson Miles ordered
Siboney evacuated and burned on July 11. An infantry unit of black soldiers,
thought to be immune to yellow fever (see above), was brought in to tend to the
afﬂicted. More than a third of their regiment died from yellow fever or malaria.
Over 50,000 U.S. troops remained in Cuba after Spain surrendered and although
massive efforts were made to clean up the island and to introduce ‘‘modern’’ san-
itation, epidemics continued. Finally Dr. George Sternberg, the Surgeon-General of
the Army from 1893 until 1902, established a commission in 1898, headed by Dr.
Walter Reed, an eminent physician, to investigate the causes of Yellow Fever
(http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/fever/peopleevents/e_cuba.html).
10.7
Carlos Finlay
Although Dr. Carlos Finlay of Cuba (1833–1915) had proposed that mosquitoes
were the source of the disease 20 years before the commission appointment, this
idea was looked upon with great skepticism by the medical profession at the time.
10.6
The Spanish-American War
173

The American research on the causes of malaria, the American physician and
founder of the republic Benjamin Rush suspected that the mosquito might be
involved in yellow fever as early as 1793.
Carlos Finlay (Fig. 10.2), of Scottish–French parentage, was born in Cuba and
was sent to France for schooling. While there he became ill with chorea (a disease
characterized by jerking movements) and typhoid fever and returned to Cuba.
Unable to get into the medical school of Havana, Finlay attended Jefferson
Medical College in Philadelphia. There he learned about the germ theory of dis-
ease, and became an advocate for this hypothesis. He was keenly interested in
bacteriology and epidemiology, and proposed that water was the source of cholera
outbreaks on the island of Cuba. He also suggested that mosquitoes of speciﬁc
strains were the vectors of yellow fever, an idea he insisted on, based on his
experimentation for 20 years before the Reed Commission was established. He
published his ﬁrst paper on yellow fever in 1872 and in 1881 he proposed that the
Culex mosquito be ‘‘hypothetically considered as the agent of transmission of
yellow fever.’’ Between 1881 and 1902 he carried out experiments on more than
100 mosquito-bitten individuals, most of whom did not contract yellow fever
(although a few did). He was unaware of the extrinsic period required for the virus
to replicate in the mosquito (see below) before it became infectious [10], which
cast doubt on his theory.
Although most histories credit Finlay with the hypothesis that the Culex mos-
quito was the agent of yellow fever, in a monograph published in 1991, François
Delaporte [11] takes issue with this and suggests that Finlay’s hypothesis was
based on the work of Patrick Manson, who proposed in his paper of 1898 that the
ﬁlaria responsible for elephantiasis required time outside the mosquito body to

develop into the form that invades humans. Delaporte states that Finlay‘s writings
deliberately ignored Manson’s work. Finlay must have been aware of this work,
which was extensively reported, and in fact Manson proposed that perhaps yellow
fever was spread by the mosquito, although exactly how was unknown. Whatever
the truth, Finlay helped the Reed Commission with its work by supplying mos-
quitoes infected with the virus.
Other physicians previously hypothesized that mosquitoes could spread disease.
In 1807 John Crawford of Baltimore published a paper stating that mosquitoes
were responsible for malaria and yellow fever, among other diseases [1]. Crawford
(1746–1813) was a physician who had spent considerable time on board ships, and
traveled in the East. He was at odds with most of his medical colleagues and
believed that ‘‘animacules’’ and other living creatures caused disease. ‘‘Crawford
preached investigation and observation, directly applying those principles to the
pathogenesis of infestation by parasitic living microorganisms. Nature and his
Creator hold the keys, and responsible medical reasoning must observe and
interpret accordingly. Well ahead of his time with his thinking, his theories
unfortunately would not receive proper acceptance until well after his death’’

‘‘Here I have been sitting reading that most wonderful book—La Roche on
Yellow Fever—written in 1853. Forty-seven years later it has been permitted to me
and my assistants to lift the impenetrable veil that has surrounded the causation of
this most dreadful pest of humanity and to put it on a rational and scientiﬁc basis.’’
Walter Reed wrote this to his wife on December 31, 1900. The commission con-
sisted of James Carroll, Aristides Agramonte, and Jesse Lazear and, of course,
Walter Reed, and assistance was received from Dr. Carlos Finlay. Walter Reed was
born in Virginia in 1851, received his MD at age 17 from UVA, and then moved to
Bellevue Hospital in New York, today afﬁliated with New York University. He was
appointed an ofﬁcial of the New York Board of Health. From 1874 to 1890 he
served in the U.S. Army as a physician, with a sabbatical at Johns Hopkins Medical
School, where he trained in bacteriology. In 1893 he was appointed professor of
bacteriology at the Army Medical School. Apart from his work with yellow fever,
he established the importance of human–human transmission of typhoid fever.
Aristides Agramonte was born in 1868 in Camaguey, Cuba was who received
his MD from Columbia University and worked for the New York Health
Department. He was thought to be immune to yellow fever since childhood and
thus performed most of the autopsies in Cuba.

Yellow Fever

James Carroll was born in England on June 5, 1854. He was educated at Albion
House Academy, Woolwich, England, graduating in 1869. He graduated from the
Medical Department, University of Maryland in 1891, and from a post-graduate
course in pathology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1891.
Jesse Lazear (1866–1900) was born in Baltimore joined the Yellow Fever
Commission in 1900. Previously, he had worked at Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore, and had become familiar and interested in the work of Sir Ronald Ross
on the role of the anopheles mosquito in the spread of malaria. Prior to the
mosquito hypothesis, a great deal of effort was placed on trying to prove or
disprove a suggestion from an Italian scientist, Giuseppi Sanarelli, that bacillus
icteroides was the causative agent of the disease. However, the team proved
conclusively that this bacterium was secondary to the infection and was not related
to yellow fever. The bacterium could be isolated from many patients and thus was
a candidate for the disease. It produced a toxin that gave rise to symptoms of
yellow fever in many animal models. Agramonte showed that it was not present in
all yellow fever victims and could be isolated from uninfected individuals and was
thus a ‘‘contaminating’’ agent (Fig. 10.5).
A second bacterium—a spirochete—was also claimed to be the cause of yellow
fever, It could be isolated from mosquitoes, and caused symptoms similar to
yellow fever in guinea pigs and other animals. However, when pursued further, it
was found in patients with a disease similar to yellow fever, but not the true
condition. To quote from Reed,
In a word, then, the careful bacteriological study which the commission had made in cases
of yellow fever had given no indications as to the presence of the speciﬁc agent of this
disease. The same may be said concerning the result of numerous microscopic examin-
ations of fresh and stained specimens of blood which we had in the meanwhile studied
with the view of ﬁnding possibly some intracellular or extracellular body.
Reed then proposed human experimentation on a large scale in a letter he wrote
to George Miller Sternberg (Fig. 10.6):
‘‘There is plenty of material in Havana, with every probability of its rapid increase—our
last case here died on Monday—we will therefore expect to transfer our ﬁeld of work to
Military Hospital No. 1—Lazaer, Carroll and Agramonte are all deeply interested in the
problem, Personally, I feel that only can experimentation on human beings serve to clear
the ﬁeld for further effective work—with one or two points cleared up, we could then work
to so much better advantage.
The ﬁnal determination to investigate the mosquito theory was arrived at during an
informal meeting of the Board (Dr. Agramonte being absent) at Columbia Barracks on the
evening before Dr. Reed’s departure for the United States early in August 1900… The
proposal to submit ourselves to inoculation was made by myself, twice, before it was
brought up by Dr. Reed, for the ﬁrst time, at the meeting above mentioned, where it was
ﬁnally decided upon by actual vote.

There follows a long correspondence between Carrol, Lazear, their respective
wives, and Walter Reed. Some of this is reproduced below (Fig. 10.7).
• Lazear experiments on himself and eight volunteers—none become ill as
mosquitoes have not undergone extrinsic incubation period.
• 8/27/1900 Lazear places a mosquito on Carroll’s arm that had fed 12 days
earlier on a yellow fever patient. 8/29 Carroll develops symptoms.
• However Carroll travels off post to Havana before developing yellow fever, so
that when he develops yellow fever it is not conclusive that it was from the
mosquito. He recovers by 9/7/1900.
Both Carroll and Lazear allowed themselves to be bitten by mosquitoes to
prove their point: that the insect carried the virus. To justify the experimentation
on others, Carroll voluntarily submitted to the bite of contaminated mosquitoes
that were previously linked to three well-documented cases of yellow fever.
Within four days he became ill and suffered a severe attack of the disease. He
recovered, but with signiﬁcant damage to his heart. He died in Washington, D.C.,
in 1907—probably as a result of the experiment. Jesse Lazear became familiar
with the work of Finlay and received mosquitoes from him and allowed them to

gorge themselves on yellow fever victims. It is suggested in his notebook that he
allowed himself to be bitten by such a mosquito, and became ill with a Severe and
sudden case of yellow fever from which he never recovered. His death was one
more proof that mosquitoes carried this deadly disease (Fig. 10.8).

• September 18, 1900. Develops fever.
• September 22, 1900. Black vomit.
• September 25, 1900. Lazear dies.

saw him alive on the 3rd or 4th day of his illness.’’

The emphasis in the commission then changed from what was the cause of the
disease to what was the vector, since experiments showed that the disease could
not be spread by fomites (clothing) or by personal contacts. Both the mosquitoes
used to bite Lazear and a volunteer soldier, William Dove, and Dr. Carroll, had
obtained a meal of blood 12 days before the bite. The fact that there was an
extrinsic incubation period in the mosquito was an accidental discovery, but an
important one, since it explained why most of Finlay’s experiments did not work.
Following the death of Lazear and the positive results with Carroll and Dove, a
camp with volunteers was established. That the disease was not of bacterial origin
was also proven by the observation that it was carried in ‘‘infected blood’’ that had
passed through a Berkefeld ﬁlter, known to retain bacterium.
Reed, who in general received most of the acclaim for proving that yellow fever
was transmitted by mosquitoes, acknowledges in his letters that most of the work
was done by Finlay in isolation before the days of the commission. When the
commission decided to test the mosquito theory, Finlay provided the mosquitoes,
and with the commission’s ﬁrst scientiﬁcally valid success, Reed wrote trium-
phantly, ‘‘The full run of experiments at Camp Lazear vindicated Finlay‘s two-
decade-long struggle. In the light of this success,’’ Reed acknowledged, ‘‘it was
Finlay‘s theory, and he deserves much for having suggested it.’’
Camp Lazear was established, and volunteers gave informed consent to be
bitten by mosquitoes. This is probably the ﬁrst case of ‘‘informed consent’’ of
human subjects in medical experimentation. These were mostly army personnel
and new Spanish immigrants to Cuba. Some were immune and others non-immune
to yellow fever. Reed’s idea was to establish conditions suspected up to now of
being involved in the disease transmission (unsanitary conditions, etc., but not
mosquitoes), and separate facilities that were clean but allowed access to mos-
quitoes. A description of the camp and informed consent by the volunteers can be
found in the collection of papers at the Philip S. Hench Walter Reed Yellow Fever
Collection at the University of Virginia (http://yellowfever.lib.virginia.edu/reed/
story.html).
The results of these experiments left no doubt that mosquitoes were the vectors
of yellow fever. As for the causative agent, the question was left unsolved until
much later, when it was shown that it was a virus. It is worth reading Reed’s reports
on the experiments carried out to prove the mosquito link. These papers describe in
detail the conditions taken to isolate some men from mosquitoes, yet expose them
to yellow fever-contaminated blankets, towels, and even clothing. In one of the set-
ups, the disease could only be transmitted by mosquitoes, or by direct injection of
blood from a patient with the disease. This proved without a doubt that this was a
blood-borne disease, transmitted by mosquitoes. The virus had to incubate and
replicate in the mosquito, and thus had a unique life cycle [12–14] (An excellent
description of the work of the commission can also be found in [1]).

Once the mosquito was discovered as the source of yellow fever, Major Wil-
liam C. Gorgas, who had been appointed at the time of the Spanish-American War
to oversee sanitation in Havana, set out to eradicate the Aedes aegypti mosquito
from Havana. Gorgas’s campaign was one of the most successful sanitation
campaigns in history. He destroyed all sources of stagnant water, covered barrels
of drinking water, removed vases, etc., from houses, and every possible breeding
ground for mosquito larvae was removed. Gorgas and his men went from house to
house destroying possible breeding grounds, and putting oil on top of water
sources to suffocate the larvae. Within a few months, yellow fever was almost
completely wiped out in Havana.
10.9
Panama Canal
The economic importance of the Panama Canal cannot be underestimated. It is today
the main shipping route between the Paciﬁc ports and European and North American
East Coast ports. The idea of building a canal across the narrow Isthmus of Panama is
as old as the discovery of America. However, actual attempts to build this canal were
not made until 1881 when the French decided to build the canal, under the leadership
of Ferdinand De Lesseps, at that time 74 years old. De Lesseps had been instru-
mental in the building of the Suez Canal, and felt that it would not be difﬁcult to build
a canal across Panama. This was a huge undertaking, and started off with great pomp.
It was called ‘‘La Grande Entreprise’’ and was one of the largest ﬁnancial ventures
ever attempted at the time, launched with a great deal of French pride and nation-
alism. About 200 engineers and 800 laborers began building the infrastructure
necessary for a project of this size. By the end of 1881, 2,000 men were employed in
building the canal. In 1882, approximately 400 deaths were reported from disease
and the next year this number climbed to 1,500, mostly from yellow fever. Over
20,000 workers, mostly French, died of malaria or yellow fever, making it difﬁcult to
recruit engineers and other workers. After a few years, the Canal Company collapsed
and De Lesseps and his son returned to France to face trial for embezzlement of
funds; they were found guilty, but did not serve time in jail.
A U.S.-owned company built the canal on territory leased from Panama.
Building began in 1904, after the area had been cleaned of mosquitoes (now
known to spread both yellow fever and malaria), and was successfully completed
in 1914. The hero of this venture was again Colonel George William C. Gorgas,
who carried out a policy of eradicating mosquitoes in the isthmus area of Panama,
at a time when the mosquito theory of transmission of the disease was not readily
accepted. Although his approach to dealing with yellow fever faced much skep-
ticism, in 1908 he was appointed president of the American Medical Association,
and then named surgeon-general of the U.S. Army, a position he held during the
1918 inﬂuenza epidemic. He was still in charge when the ﬁrst ships sailed through
the canal in 1914. He suddenly died in 1920 after having been knighted in Eng-
land, and he was given a hero’s state funeral in Washington and London.

Yellow Fever

10.10 The Virus
Yellow fever virus belongs to a class of viruses known as arboviruses, i.e.,
‘‘ARthropod BOrne’’ viruses, since it is insect-transmitted. Within this general
classiﬁcation it belongs to the, ﬂavivirus genus. It is an icosahedral-enveloped
virus of about 50 nm diameters containing single-stranded RNA. It is related to the
West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses (Fig. 10.9).
As discussed above, the infection is often innocuous in the young, who then
acquire immunity, but can also lead to internal bleeding, black vomiting, high
fever, and death in the susceptible individual.
The epidemiology of the yellow fever virus is complicated. It appears that there
are three routes of transmission:
1. Jungle yellow fever (Sylvatic), where the virus is spread from a non-human
primate to another non-human primate by mosquitoes that live on the canopy of
the jungle;
2. Savannah, which is at the edge of the jungle and the virus is spread between
primates and humans; and
3. Urban yellow fever, where there is human-to-human transmission through the
mosquito vector (Fig. 10.10). One puzzling fact is that the virus does not appear
in Asia, even in the tropics, which suggests some possible competing immunity,
or the lack of a suitable vector in that environment. Even today, in the era of air
travel and population mixing, there is no evidence of yellow fever in the Orient.
Although the virus can be transmitted by a number of strains of mosquitoes, the
primary vector is Aedes aegypti, which prefers humans, and lives close to human
habitats in vessels containing stagnant water (Fig. 10.11). The mosquito can be
found in old tires, and in uncovered water sources; it can live for a long time, up to
70–160 days and has less than a 300 m ﬂight range. Unlike the anopheles that
spreads malaria, this insect bites during the day rather than at night, and lives in
different habitats. It is the female who imbibes the blood, incubates the virus and
transmits the disease. There is an incubation period of 10–12 days in the insect,
and after being digested by the insect, the virus remains in the gut where it
replicates and is then transmitted to the salivary gland, a time known as the
extrinsic period. Many insects transmit the virus to the ovary (transovarial trans-
mission), but this does not seem common in Aedes aegypti, although it does occur
in other mosquitoes that transmit dengue, and in tick viruses.
An interesting social factor is related to the mosquito involved in the transfer of
yellow fever. In the outbreaks in Philadelphia and other cities, it was noted that the
wealthy and those who lived in sanitary conditions became sick at the same rate as
the poor, who lived in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions. Thus the mosquito
was able to breed in water closets outside of wealthy homes or in barrels collecting
water for household use; mosquito eradication was essential for the elimination of
the disease.

Yellow Fever

10.11 Vaccine Development
Despite the identiﬁcation of a virus as the agent of yellow fever, initial attempts at
production of a vaccine were based on the ﬁnding of a bacterial spirochete (mobile
spiral-like organism) in the livers of many victims of the disease—which led to the
hypothesis of a bacterial origin for the disease. Hideyo Noguchi, a scientist at the
Rockefeller Institute, isolated this organism and named the novel spirochete
‘‘Leptospira icteroides.’’ Although previously proven by the Reed Commission not
to be the causative agent of yellow fever, he pursued his idea and developed a
vaccine against it. Noguchi published successful results for over 7,000 doses of the
vaccine. However, others could not repeat his experiments and by 1926 the use of
this vaccine slowly disappeared, but this was not the end of the bacterial origin of
yellow fever. The second West African Yellow Fever Commission was formed in
1925 (a prior commission in 1920 had accomplished little) to investigate whether
South American yellow fever was similar to that of African yellow fever, and to
explore the root of the disease. The commission was made up primarily of bac-
teriologists who had previously studied Leptospira, and they were also joined by
Noguchi, who still had not abandoned the idea that Leptospira icteroidase was the
Fig. 10.11 Aedes aegypti
10.10
The Virus
185

causative agent of the disease. Whether due to carelessness, allowing themselves
to be bitten by mosquitoes, or through contact with infected blood of monkeys, all
the main members of the commission, including Noguchi, died from yellow fever.
Prof. Adrian Stokes, a well-known pathologist, was the head of the group, and he
set out to conﬁrm Noguchi’s theory. He isolated blood from an infected person and
succeeded in transferring the disease to a rhesus monkey. He was unable to isolate
any leptospira from the large number of monkeys he infected and he himself
succumbed to yellow fever, not living to see that the infected monkeys carried a
strain of yellow fever virus later called the ‘‘Asibi’’ strain that would eventually be
used in vaccine development. Asibi was the name of the individual who supplied
the blood samples injected into the rhesus monkey, and this virus later became a
major source of vaccine [15].
This project of developing a vaccine was taken over by Max Theiler of the
Rockefeller Institute. The parental virus proved to be fatal to rhesus monkeys, and
caused encephalitis when inoculated into the brains of mice. But, as in the case of
rabies passage through rabbits as described by Pasteur, passage through the mouse
led to an attenuated virus, although still neurotropic in man. Subsequent experi-
ments carried out by Theiler showed that the continuous passage through chick
embryo cultures resulted in an attenuated virus and loss of neurotropic effects. This
virus appears to have mutated and lost its afﬁnity for internal organs as well as its
neurotropism. Millions have been vaccinated with little or no side effects. There
have been cases of jaundice due to contamination of human serum used in the
preparation of some batches. Immunity, however, is long-lasting. Sequencing of
the virus, and comparison with the wild type, original Asibi strain, have shown as
many as 69 substitutions in nucleic acid between the parental Asibi strain and the
strain used for the vaccine. Many of these mutations are in the envelope of the
virus and may have altered its neurotropism [15, 16]. Since this is an RNA virus,
this high rate of mutation is not unexpected, and the recognition that the virus
continued to mutate at a high frequency led to the development of seed lots that
were frozen and used as required (For more details, see Chap. 19 on vaccine
development).
10.12 Other Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses
There are many other viruses that cause symptoms similar to yellow fever and are
transmitted by insects. In all cases, the symptoms are similar, although not as
severe as in yellow fever. The virus attacks the blood vessel walls, causing internal
bleeding. This is accompanied by high fever, nausea, headaches, and jaundice.
Among these viruses are dengue, equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, Ebola,
Lassa fever and Colorado tick fever. Many of these viruses have an avian or
primate reservoir and are transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, sand ﬂies or gnats or
other insects. Not all are ﬂaviviruses, but belong to a different genus. Vaccines are
not currently available for these infections.

Yellow Fever

10.13 Yellow Fever Today (2014)
There are an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever, causing 30,000 deaths
worldwide every year, according to the WHO, and the virus is still endemic in
tropical areas of Latin America and Africa. There has been an increase in the
incidence the last few years due to declining numbers of people being vaccinated,
movement of populations into ‘‘virgin’’ areas, deforestation, urbanization, and
possibly climate change. Yellow fever can be totally prevented by vaccination, and
one inoculation appears to last for life. In order to stamp out the epidemic, 80 % of
the population of any one area would have to be vaccinated.
The use of insecticides can eliminate mosquitoes but the campaigns against the
mosquitoes have lapsed in many countries due to government inefﬁciency. The
WHO recommends total vaccination of populations above nine months of age, as
well as maintaining surveillance to identify local outbreaks. There appears to be
enough vaccine for everyone in endemic regions. Between 2007 and 2012, 12
countries completed preventative yellow fever vaccination campaigns: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea,
Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo (WHO) (Fig. 10.12).

Yellow Fever Today (2014)

Arthropod transmission provides a mechanism for a virus to cross species
barriers, since the same insect may bite birds, reptiles, and mammals. Reservoir
hosts, such as birds and mammals, may have sub-clinical infections. Humans are
often ‘‘accidental’’ hosts, and in such cases the disease is severe (e.g., yellow fever
and dengue). In the case of yellow fever, it is believed that the monkey is the
primary target, but it can also act as a reservoir. Another mode of transmission
does not involve bites by insects, but the virus may be transmitted to a cow or goat
by a tick and is then carried in the milk. Tick-borne encephalitis has been reported
in man (in Austria) and other countries from eating cheese prepared from
unpasteurized goat milk. As we see from inﬂuenza, various animals or birds may
act as viral reservoirs.
Some of the factors involved in the increased spread of insect-borne disease
include:
• Population movements into new habitats, notably tropical forests
• Deforestation with the development of new farmlands
• Irrigation, especially primitive irrigation systems that pay no attention to
arthropod control
• Uncontrolled urbanization with vector population breeding in the accumulation
of water and sewage
• Increased long-distance air travel with the potential for carriage of vectors and
persons incubating virus. This is the greatest danger today
• New routings of long-distance bird migrations brought about by man-made
water projects.

Abstract
Every few years the world faces the risk of a new inﬂuenza pandemic. Novel
strains of inﬂuenza are found in chickens, ducks, or other aquatic birds and
result in speculation and occasionally panic that a new inﬂuenza epidemic is
imminent. These are unique recombinant classes of inﬂuenza, an ‘‘old’’ virus
that undergoes rapid shifts in its ability to spread from birds or animals to
humans, and then from human to human. Inﬂuenza changes its antigenicity by
two methods: antigenic drift, which is the result of a mutation in a viral gene,
usually the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase, and antigenic shift, which results
from the reassortment of the eight segments of the inﬂuenza genome. More than
50 million people died as a result of the 1918 pandemic, a novel virus infecting
humans (H1N1 inﬂuenza). The 1918 pandemic ﬂu virus has been reconstructed
from samples stored in hospitals and dug up from permafrost. This virus is
unique and appears to have been a novel virus not related to swine ﬂu but
possibly to an avian source. Other pandemics, such as Asian ﬂu or Hong Kong
ﬂu, have followed periodically. The last few years have seen massive culling of
poultry due to outbreaks of other recombinant inﬂuenza viruses such as H5N1
and H7N9. Vaccines against inﬂuenza are rapidly changing by growing the
virus in cell culture, and the development of recombinant techniques.

The Virus
Every few years the world faces the prospect of a new inﬂuenza pandemic. Novel
strains of inﬂuenza are found in domestic poultry, ducks, or other aquatic birds and
result in speculation and occasional panic that a new inﬂuenza epidemic is
imminent. These are novel recombinant classes of inﬂuenza A virus that undergo
rapid shifts in its ability to spread from birds to man and then from man to man.

The inﬂuenza virus belongs to the orthomyxovirus family, of which there are
three main types: inﬂuenza A, the one responsible for pandemics; inﬂuenza B,
which causes ﬂu-like symptoms and is connected to local epidemics; and inﬂuenza
C, which is the least pathogenic. Whereas inﬂuenza B and C are conﬁned to
humans, inﬂuenza A infects a wide variety of animals, including birds, swine, and
horses. Aquatic birds serve as the major reservoir for all known subtypes of
inﬂuenza A; the virus replicates in the bird’s gut, in many cases without causing
symptoms.
Inﬂuenza is a negative-stranded RNA virus with eight unique segments of
RNA, each containing information for one or more viral genes (Fig. 11.1). Each
segment of RNA can be considered a mini-chromosome. The expression ‘‘neg-
ative-stranded’’ denotes viruses in which the RNA is copied into a comple-
mentary strand that is then used for the manufacturing of viral proteins. The
virus is enveloped and its shape can be pleomorphic. Virions are 80–120 nm in
diameter.
The major genes involved in the immune response to inﬂuenza are the hem-
agglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes. The combination of these two genes
gives rise to the different genotypes of the virus. The hemagglutinin is involved in
the attachment of the virus to the cell, and the neuraminidase in the release of the
virus. Modiﬁcations in the polymerase gene may affect the pathogenicity of the
virus.

11.2
Antigenic Drift and Antigenic Shift
As is common with all RNA viruses, inﬂuenza undergoes a high frequency of
single-base mutations, giving rise to new ‘‘antigenic strains.’’ This process is
known as ‘‘antigenic drift’’ and results in an altered amino acid in proteins, such as
the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase, (N), thus changing its antigenicity. This
is the process by which RNA viruses form quasi-species and evade antibodies.
In the event that two separate inﬂuenza viruses infect the same cell, there is
likely to be shufﬂing of the viral RNA segments resulting in re-assortment and a
recombinant virus. Thus different chromosomes from different viruses may be
packaged in the same coat. This event is known as ‘‘antigenic shift’’ and is the
basis of new strains of inﬂuenza. Antigenic shift can involve two speciﬁc RNA
segments containing genes coding for proteins involved in receptor binding and
penetration of the cell. These are the hemagglutinin, which are receptors binding
protein that attach to speciﬁc sites on the cell surface (particularly of the lung) and
the neuraminidase, which is involved in the penetration of the virus into the cell;
thus, H7N9 refers to hemagglutinin of type 7 and neuraminidase of type 9. The
pandemic inﬂuenza virus of 1918 (discussed below) was called H1N1 and is the
reference strain for all other epidemics. Following infection, the infected indi-
vidual produces antibodies to these two proteins. Changes in the antigenicity of the
virus have occurred since the 1918 pandemic.
The ﬁrst human inﬂuenza virus A subtype, H1N1, was isolated in the laboratory
in 1933. It was responsible for all recorded inﬂuenza infections until 1957. In sera
(blood) from persons born during this period—regardless of their age—the highest
inﬂuenza antibody titers interact with the H1N1 subtypes. In 1947 another H1N1
subtype (variant) emerged that could not be neutralized efﬁciently with antibodies
to the 1933 variant. Antibodies to this 1947 isolate supplanted all prior strains in
the human population. In 1957 a new recombinant, the ‘‘Asian’’ inﬂuenza virus
H2N2 took over, a strain that had acquired three new segments of avian origin.
This virus resulted in a serious pandemic with high numbers of infections and

deaths. In 1968 another recombinant variant, the ‘‘Hong Kong ﬂu’’ (H3N2)
emerged. In this case, the H gene and another gene, PB1, replaced the previous
genes. In 1977 a novel H1N1 strain arose, similar to the 1950 variant. (These
pandemics are summarized in Table 11.1.) Thus, individuals born at different
times may have serum antibodies to different subtypes. These different subtypes
arose by antigenic shifts, probably by recombination events in different animals.
Human type 1 inﬂuenza can be isolated from horses, pigs, and aquatic birds. This
antigenic shift, as well as antigenic drift, make it difﬁcult to develop an efﬁcient
vaccine since it is impossible to predict what strain of virus will infect humans at a
future time. The differences between antigenic drift and antigenic shift are
explained in Figs. 11.2 and 11.3 from the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (USPHS).

11.3
History of Influenza Epidemics
Inﬂuenza epidemics have occurred periodically since the Middle Ages. Since
1500, there appear to have been 14 or more inﬂuenza pandemics; the epidemics
appear to begin in Central Asia (China) and move from east to west. This may be
related to the proximity of humans to domestic fowl, or to the migratory patterns of
birds.
Since the beginning of the ‘‘germ theory’’ era, pandemics have been reported to
have occurred in 1847–1848, 1889, 1918, 1957, 1968, 1977, and 2009. The most
serious of these was in 1889–1890 and 1918. The 1889 virus spread rapidly
through railway connections and steam ships throughout the world. The virus
killed millions, mostly elderly people, but without greatly affecting society [1].
The pandemic of 2009 was not as severe as the others. Table 11.1 and Fig. 11.4
present a timeline of the pandemics since 1918.
The 1957 pandemic (Asian ﬂu) was caused by the H2N2 virus, and the 1968
pandemic (Hong Kong ﬂu) by H3N2. The Asian ﬂu began in China in 1956 and
lasted until 1958. This ﬂu outbreak—with an estimated 69,800 deaths in the U.S.
alone—appeared to be the result of the re-assortment of virus segments between
avian and human sources, The outbreak was accompanied by very high fever,
general pain and malaise. A vaccine was developed against this strain in 1957. The
Asian ﬂu caused an estimated one to two million deaths worldwide.
After 10 years of evolution, the Asian ﬂu virus disappeared, having been
replaced through antigenic shift by a new inﬂuenza A subtype, H3N2, which gave
rise to the Hong Kong ﬂu pandemic, which began in the spring of 1968, and by the
fall had spread to the U.S. There were about 34,000 deaths in the U.S., and a

195

million worldwide; this pandemic ended in 1970. Currently, the predominant
antibodies in the human population are to this particular ﬂu. Endemic inﬂuenza
kills about 30,000 people in the U.S. each year, mostly the aged.
Another strain of inﬂuenza, a variant of H1N1, occurred in 2009–2010, but the
epidemic was not as severe as predicted. This virus appears to have developed as a
result of recombination between two swine variants and was ﬁrst detected in the
United States in April 2009. The virus was a unique combination of viral genes
never before identiﬁed in either animals or humans. The virus genes were a
combination of genes most closely related to North American swine H1N1 and
Eurasian lineage swine-origin H1N1 inﬂuenza viruses. Because of this, initial
reports referred to the virus as ‘‘swine ﬂu’’ but investigations of initial human cases
did not show any contact with pigs and it quickly it became apparent that this new
virus was circulating among humans and not among U.S. pig herds. Although dire
predictions were made of the effect of this virus, it was not as severe as expected
and resulted in a moderate pandemic [2].
11.4
The H5N1 Influenza Epidemic
At the time of this writing, another ﬂu epidemic, milder than predicted, is ongoing,
even though some virologists are predicting a worst-case scenario of subsequent
epidemics. The H5N1 virus (avian ﬂu) has been around for quite a few years and
its potential to infect man is still unpredictable. Its appearance has led to the
destruction of millions of heads of poultry and ducks. The human toll has not been
so great—about 350 fatalities out of 650 cases—mostly in those in close contact
with infected poultry, either by direct contact or handling uncooked meat. The
fatality rate is about 60 %. Table 11.2 presents the total number of cases and
deaths from the beginning of the outbreak until 2013.
The ﬁnancial losses from H5N1 has been staggering. Billions of dollars have
been lost in the poultry industry due to the culling of chickens and ducks, which
has meant large losses in the Far East to poultry farmers, most of whom are poor.
According to the New York Times, due to the H5N1 threat, as of March 2006,
‘‘Governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential inﬂuenza
pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies
for tighter border controls.’’ The major Southeast Asian economies have seen
direct costs, approximately 140 million birds culled and the stated costs of con-
taining the epidemic are approximately U.S. $10 billion (World Bank 2005). In
November of 2005, President Bush announced a ‘‘National Strategy to Safeguard
against the Danger of Pandemic Inﬂuenza,’’ at a cost of $7.1 billion, while other
countries have carried out similar but less expensive plans to curb the outbreak.
The precautions taken included the culling of ﬂocks; mass vaccinations; closing of
borders; and banning of tourism in certain areas of Southeast Asia. The last two
large poultry culling exercises in Hong Kong took place in June 2008, after
inspection uncovered H5N1 in chicken feces samples, and in December 2008,
196

Influenza

when the virus killed scores of chickens at a chicken farm. In 1997, six people died
from the H5N1 virus in Hong-Kong and 1.3 million chickens were culled. Hong
Kong’s last recorded human case of H5N1 was in November 2010—a 59-year-old
woman who came down with the illness after returning from a trip to Mainland
China, but survived. There have been reports of farmers committing suicide as a
result of ﬁnancial ruin, and others hiding their chickens to avoid slaughter. The
cost to the poultry sector in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam has been estimated
at U.S. $560 million [3]. Vaccination is an especially labor-intensive task, costing
huge amounts. Even then, there are doubts as to whether a vaccine will work,
given the viruses’ propensity to undergo antigenic drift; in fact, vaccines against
H5N1 have been prepared and do not seem to be very effective.
Has the effect of H5N1 been overstated and led to panic? Luckily it has not
mutated so that human-to-human transmission occurs only on a very limited scale.
The hemagglutinin of this speciﬁc virus binds to a sialic-acid receptor that is found
deep in the lower respiratory tract, whereas other inﬂuenza viruses, with H1, H2,
and H3, bind to a receptor in the upper respiratory tract. This has been suggested as
a possible reason for the lack of human-to-human spread on a pandemic scale [4,
5]. Many countries have set up rapid response teams to cull poultry as soon as a
case of H5N1 is reported. On the positive side, this outbreak has increased the
efﬁciency of poultry husbandry by introduction of new methods, as well as better
hygiene in chicken coops. Since the virus is carried in wild aquatic birds and other
species of birds, it is very difﬁcult to control. A schematic of the spread of the
different strains of inﬂuenza virus is presented in Fig. 11.5.

The H5N1 Influenza Epidemic
197

Recent experiments have been performed by scientists in Holland and the U.S.
to alter the H5N1 virus host range. These experiments are dangerous and have
been met with consternation and controversy and are discussed in the chapter on
creating viruses in vitro (Chap. 21).
There are as many as 16 known variants of the hemagglutinin (H) gene, and 9
known variants of the Neuraminidase (N) gene, [6] but only the H1, H2 and H3
and N1 and N2 subtypes appear to infect humans, although recently (in 2013) there
was an outbreak of H7N9—a totally novel strain of inﬂuenza pathogenic to
humans.
11.5
H7N9 Influenza Epidemic
Another recombinant virus that has recently come on the scene is the H7N9
inﬂuenza virus. As in the case of H5N1, this is an avian virus with low trans-
mission rates to humans. H7 is not usually associated with human viruses. Over the
past *135 years, H7 inﬂuenza viruses have neither caused pandemics nor
undergone human adaptation [7]. However, as in the case of H5N1, there have
been some human fatalities among poultry workers and there is fear of a pandemic.

Influenza

It has been associated with 132 cases and 28 related deaths in China as of June
2013. Although not pathogenic to humans, as discussed above, there is danger of
the virus infecting other mammals, mixing with other inﬂuenza subtypes. As
pointed out by David Morens and Anthony Fauci [7] no poultry inﬂuenza has
infected humans on a large scale since records have been kept after 1918. As in the
case of H5N1, there was some degree of panic when this virus was discovered,
with the expectation, at least in the popular press, that this virus would lead to
another pandemic. Some changes have occurred in the virus since May 2013 that
possibly make the virus more pathogenic and enhance human transmission.
However, so far the virus has been conﬁned to speciﬁc areas of China, with the
human infections resulting in clusters of families who live close to their poultry.
One case was recently found outside of China, in Malaysia, in a traveller who
arrived from China.
11.6
Viral Reservoirs
These periodic outbreaks bring up some interesting questions: Where is the virus
in between pandemics? It is thought that type A inﬂuenza is maintained in aquatic
birds. There is no evidence of viral latency in humans, as there is for herpes
viruses. Any discussion of inﬂuenza should consider the work of Robert Webster
and his group at St. Jude’s Hospital in Memphis. Webster has spent a lifetime
tracking inﬂuenza spread and evolution, isolating the virus from bird droppings
throughout the world. He concludes that studies on the ecology of inﬂuenza viruses
have established that all known inﬂuenza A viruses are maintained in aquatic
birds, and he suggested that aquatic birds are the primordial source of all inﬂuenza
viruses in other species [8]. These birds are adapted to the virus and are not made
sick by it, indicating an old evolutionary relationship. By following the migratory
patterns of birds, it was concluded that ducks harbor the virus and spread the virus
to other birds [6] (Fig. 11.6).
What triggers the pandemics? There is no answer to this question, since it
appears to be a random event in which a subtle change in the virus may lead to
increased infectivity to humans through human-human transmission or increased
pathogenicity. Two strains of inﬂuenza may infect the same animal (duck, chicken,
pig), undergo recombination by gene reassortment, (antigenic shift), and result in a
novel virus with increased infectivity to humans and human-human transmission.
That aquatic birds and ducks may be the major reservoir of inﬂuenza A has
recently been challenged by new research that has shown that inﬂuenza may have
originated in horses in the nineteenth century [9].
Owing to an error-prone RNA polymerase, the rate of mutation is very high. In
the hemagglutinin gene, it is estimated at about 2 9 10-3 base substitutions per
position per virus generation, or about one base substitution in the HA gene per
virus generation. Selection for amino acid substitutions is driven at least in part by
immune pressure, as the HA is the major target of the host immune response.
11.5
H7N9 Influenza Epidemic
199

The clinical outcome of infection depends on the host and virus strain.
Domestic poultry are very susceptible to type A, particularly with H5 and H7
combinations. These strains are not highly pathogenic in wild birds. However, the
combination of H5N1 does appear to be pathogenic to many species. This par-
ticular strain has caused pathogenic effects in wild aquatic birds, and has been
deadly to the poultry industry in Southeast Asia and in parts of Europe. In some
cases, ducks have become quite sick, but in other cases they have acted like Trojan
horses and infected poultry [10].
11.7
The Great Pandemic of 1918
The current fear of inﬂuenza (‘‘ﬂu’’) is a reﬂection of the devastating outbreak the
world faced in 1918, at the end of World War I. That particular strain of inﬂuenza
killed at least 50 million people worldwide—675,000 in the U.S. alone. It was the
most serious recorded plague to hit mankind, more deadly than the Black Death. It
was called ‘‘Spanish ﬂu’’ because the initial epidemic appeared to have begun in
Spain, but this is probably incorrect; recent research indicates that it originated in
the Western United States [9]. The epidemic killed an estimated 43,000 U.S.
servicemen—40 % of the U.S. casualties reported for WWI. In 1 month alone—
May 1918—it killed 8 million people worldwide. It spread to all corners of the
earth, and occurred as three separate recurring epidemics, targeting in particular

young people between the ages of 18 and 40, an unexpected statistic (Figs. 11.7
and 11.8).
Despite having killed more than were killed by the ‘‘Black Death,’’ the pan-
demic of 1918 was not discussed in the history books until recently, especially as
there was no Samuel Pepys to keep a diary as done in 1665. In fact, it has been
referred to as the ‘‘the forgotten pandemic’’ [12]. It was not considered a major
plague until the last 20 or 30 years, and there is not much discussion about its
economic or social impact in the scientiﬁc literature. The 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic
charged across America in 7 days and across the world in 3 months.
The initial phase of the epidemic began in the spring of 1918. There are many
theories as to where the ﬂu originated; these include among U.S. troops in France,
possibly in China or with an outbreak among soldiers in Kansas spreading east-
wards across the U.S. In the initial phase, there were not many deaths. The virus
spread, probably by troop transportation, and by May of 1918 it had reached

France, where American troops were ﬁghting the Germans; from there it spread to
Spain, Egypt, Palestine, and the Far East (China). By the summer (July) of 1918,
the pandemic was very serious in France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and parts of
the South American continent; this is referred to as the ‘‘ﬁrst wave.’’
The second wave was much more extensive. It appeared to have begun both in
France and India (possibly spread by troops) in August of 1918, quickly spreading
through all of western Europe, most of the United States and South America,
Canada, India and China. The highest death toll was in India, about 50 per 1,000
inhabitants, and there appeared to be a correlation between poverty and high death
rate. The second wave arrived in the U.S. in Boston in September of 1918 through
the port, busy with war shipments of machinery and supplies. The war also enabled
the virus to spread and diffuse through the mobilization of civilians into the army.
As they came together, they brought the virus with them and to those with whom
they had contact. The virus killed almost 20,000 in October of 1918 alone. On
November 11, 1918, when Armistice Day was celebrated at the end of the war with
parades and large gatherings (a complete disaster from the public health stand-
point), a rebirth of the epidemic occurred in some cities. The ﬂu that winter was
beyond imagination as millions were infected and thousands died [13].
The incubation period and the onset of symptoms were so short that apparently
healthy people in the prime of their lives (ages 15–35) were suddenly overcome,
and within an hour could become helpless with fever, delirium and chills. Addi-
tional symptoms were severe headache, pain in muscles and joints, hair loss, acute
congestion, and temperatures of 101–105 F. The most unusual pathologic ﬁnding
was massive pulmonary edema and/or hemorrhage. This was a unique viral
pneumonia—a patient could be convalescing one day and dead the next. Those
who did not die of the viral infection often died of secondary bacterial pneumonia.
One anecdote shared in 1918 was about four women who played bridge together
late into the night—and overnight three of them died from inﬂuenza. Others told
stories of people on their way to work suddenly developing the ﬂu and dying
within hours. One physician writes that patients with seemingly ordinary inﬂuenza
would rapidly ‘‘develop the most viscous type of pneumonia that has ever been
seen,’’ and later, when cyanosis appeared in the patients, ‘‘it is simply a struggle
for air until they suffocate.’’ Another physician recalls that the inﬂuenza patients
‘‘died struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes
gushed from their noses and mouths.’’ The physicians of the time were helpless
against this powerful virus [13].
Sir Martin Gilbert, the renowned British historian, writes, [14] ‘‘That October,
225 Londoners died of Spanish ‘Flu. This was more that all the deaths from
4 years of Zeppelin and bomber raids over Britain. In Vienna the expressionist
painter Egon Schiele was among the inﬂuenza victims. On the Western Front the
Canadian air ace, Captain Quigley, who had shot down thirty-four German planes
in combat was another victim. Of the three thousand Eskimos living on the coast of
Labrador, two thousand died of the disease. In South Africa, 20 % of the popu-
lation of Kimberley died. The disease swept the country ‘like a grass ﬁre’, a South
African reader reported to the Times, ‘with leaps of hundreds of miles’. In some
202
11
Influenza

places within a few days, doctors, chemists, nurses, butchers, bakers, and railway
staff were struck down and the complete paralysis of communities resulted as from
a stroke.
‘‘In Bombay, a thousand Indians were reported to have died of inﬂuenza in
1 month, and with each month the epidemic intensiﬁed throughout the sub-con-
tinent. ANZAC soldiers returning from Europe carried the epidemic to Australia
and New Zealand; more than 12,000 Australians died of inﬂuenza, despite two
compulsory preventative measures, the wearing of face masks and the closing of
theatres and cinemas. On November 9, as negotiations for the armistice had been
taking place in Compiegne the French Poet, Guillaume Apollinaire, died of
inﬂuenza. In Toronto on the day chosen by the city fathers to mark the Allied
victory, the victory parade itself had to come to a halt, during its triumphant march
through the city, to allow a funeral cortege of two victims of inﬂuenza to
pass…The prisoners of war held by the Allies were sent home as quickly as the
Allied prisoners. Among 300,000 Austrian prisoners of war being held in camps in
Italy, 30,000 died of inﬂuenza while still in captivity: A British army ofﬁcer,
Captain Colin Coote, who hoped to be elected to Parliament in the election of
November 1918, recalled reaching a village in his would be constituency, intent on
encouraging the voters to vote for him, and ﬁnding that every villager was
dead…..Six million died in India, the country where plague had killed a similar
number at the turn of the century.’’
That this epidemic is not much discussed in history books, or was not much
discussed until recently, might be a reﬂection of the fact that it occurred at the end
of a terrible war. In some texts it is treated as part of the history of World War I.
We must remember that when the Black Death or the ravages of smallpox
occurred, the population of the world could be measured in millions and not
billions. In 1918, other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, were rampant and
killed millions. However there is no doubt that a combination of WWI and
inﬂuenza wiped out a whole generation of young men in Europe and even in North
America. This reﬂected the ease of spread in the army where soldiers were billeted
in crowded conditions, and were packed in terrible conditions in the trenches.
Initially, historians paid most of their attention to the deaths in the military, but
more modern histories have emphasized the number of people killed in the cities
of the world by the pandemic.
11.8
Molecular Characteristics of the 1918 Pandemic Virus
Why was the pandemic of 1918 so severe? Jeffrey Taubenberger and colleagues
[15] recently sequenced the entire 8-segment genome of the 1918 inﬂuenza virus.
RNA from a victim of the 1918 pandemic was isolated from a formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded, lung tissue sample [16]. Segments of RNA were copied into
DNA sequences, and overlapping sequences reconstructed to form the complete
genome. All 8 segments were thus copied into DNA to complete the genome.
11.7
The Great Pandemic of 1918
203

Since regulatory regions were missing, these were substituted from other strains of
human inﬂuenza and the virus was then tested for infectivity in inﬂuenza-sensitive
mice. The virus was undoubtedly an H1N1 virus. Surprisingly, this virus does not
appear to be the result of reassortment between two inﬂuenza strains, nor is it the
result of avian-pig hybridization, as originally hypothesized. Rather, it appears to
be a ‘‘novel’’ virus, probably of avian (water-fowl) origin that mutated and became
pathogenic and infectious to man. All eight of the genome segments from the 1918
virus differ in signiﬁcant ways from other human ﬂu sequences, suggesting that
none of the genome came from a strain that had previously infected people. ‘‘It is
the most bird-like of all mammalian ﬂu viruses,’’ says Taubenberger [15, 16].
The reconstructed virus was much more pathogenic in mouse strains than the
control virus; in 4 days it had generated 39,000 more virus per mouse than the
control strain. In contrast to the H1N1 virus (the standard control strain), the 1918
virus could grow in cells without treating it with trypsin, was lethal to mice and
embryonated chick eggs, and grew to a higher titer in cells in culture than the
standard virus (Fig. 11.9). The virus differed from the standard strains in all eight
segments of RNA. Replacing the hemagglutinin gene with that of H1N1 reduced
pathogenicity, and replacing the polymerase genes, the genes responsible for viral
replication, also reduced virulence. Thus the 1918 strain had many differences
from the control H1N1 strain, making the combination much more lethal. A total
of 10 amino acid changes in the polymerase proteins differentiate the 1918 virus
from subsequent inﬂuenza viruses. Similar changes have been noted in the H5N1
virus, which might explain the enhanced virulence of this strain and its adaptation
to humans [17]. Phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 virus indicates that it is the
common ancestor of the human and swine H1N1 virus.

Influenza

The 1918 ﬂu was possibly transmitted from humans to pigs and was therefore
mistakenly called swine ﬂu, so for many years it was believed that the transmission
was in the other direction, i.e., from pigs to humans. It is not known why the
primary target of the infection was in the 20–40 age group. The alterations in the
polymerase may explain the high titers of the virus. The virus infection was also
accompanied by a very virulent bacterial pneumonia. This appeared to be the result
of a ‘‘cytokine storm,’’ in which acute infection with inﬂuenza virus results in an
unusually strong immune response with hundreds of cytokines being activated and
damaging the lungs.
The history of the attempts to isolate this 1918 virus is fascinating. In 1951,
scientists from the University of Iowa, including a Swedish graduate student,
Johan Hultin, went as far as the Seward Peninsula in Alaska seeking the 1918
strain. He dug up the graves (with permission) at the Brevig Mission, an Inuit
ﬁshing village. These bodies were buried in permafrost, and it was hoped to ﬁnd
some residual virus in the lungs of the ﬂu victims. However, when dug up, it was
found that the tissue and virus were completely degraded and virus could not be
recovered. In 1995, a group at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) in
Rockville, Maryland, headed by Jeffrey Taubenberger, isolated virus sequences
from autopsy specimens maintained at the institute. The army had preserved these
lung specimens in formaldehyde and embedded in parafﬁn. It was exceedingly
difﬁcult to isolate virus material from such specimens, but eventually a virus
sequence was isolated from the lung of a soldier who had died in September 1918
at Fort Jackson, South Carolina; subsequently, another sequence was isolated from
another ﬂu victim that conﬁrmed the sequences. However, the amount of material
was still very limiting. After all those years, Johan Hultin returned to Alaska in
1997 and obtained frozen lung tissue from four graves. From one of these the full
sequence could be obtained [18]. Afterwards, samples stored at the Royal London
Hospital were received and sequenced, conﬁrming the other sequences.
11.9
Can We Avoid Pandemics?
Can we predict another pandemic? Not really. Today we are better prepared for
this type of event; there are new vaccine strains; it is easier to develop vaccines
from cell culture than from eggs, the standard method; and there is a supply of
anti-ﬂu medications. However, the change to producing the virus in cell culture is
a very recent development, and the production of vaccine could be improved using
recombinant DNA techniques and modern molecular biology. The 1918 ﬂu and
subsequent pandemics spread very quickly around the globe, and the same can be
expected of the next pandemic. It is difﬁcult or impossible to predict the conse-
quences and pattern of the next one; worst-case scenarios predict 40,000,000 ill
and about 200,000 deaths.
11.8
Molecular Characteristics of the 1918 Pandemic Virus
205

Most people retain antibodies to the original infection they have experienced.
This, in part, could be the reason for the high death rate among young people in the
1918 pandemic, in that older people had antibodies to a previous exposure to a
virus similar to the H1N1. Today, people born much later have antibodies to other
strains, either H2N2 or H3N2. Attempts are being made to produce a vaccine that
contains all possible combinations of these antigens—something that should be
possible within the next few years. Thus there is a need for a universal vaccine. It
takes a few months to develop a vaccine, and by the time a suitable one has been
developed, it is possible that the epidemic will be over.
Each year, the seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine contains three inﬂuenza viruses—one
inﬂuenza A (H3N2) virus, one seasonal inﬂuenza A (H1N1) virus, and one
inﬂuenza B virus. The inﬂuenza viruses in the seasonal ﬂu vaccine are selected
each year based on surveillance-based forecasts about what viruses are most likely
to cause illness in the coming season. Therefore, each year’s seasonal ﬂu vaccine is
designed to protect against the inﬂuenza viruses expected to cause disease during
the upcoming inﬂuenza season.
Why does virus pandemic always seem to begin in Asia? This is probably
because the type of farming used in rural China involves poultry, ducks or other
animals living in close proximity to humans and to each other, and also due to
crowded markets where there is a chance of spread of the virus. These markets
contain aquatic birds, chickens, and other types of birds, as well as pigs—all
susceptible to the virus in close proximity to one another.
11.10 Molecular Biology of Influenza
Inﬂuenza subverts the host cell to produce more of itself by inhibiting host protein
synthesis. Once bound to the cell receptor, a small vesicle is formed around the
virus. In the acidic environment of the endosomes (small vacuoles ﬁlled with
liquid), the virus changes shape and fuses its envelope with the endosomal
membrane. This is followed by a signal to release the viral nucleocapsid into the
host cytoplasm. From there, the nucleocapsid travels to the host nucleus, where the
virus undergoes primary transcription to produce proteins necessary for replica-
tion. The primary transcription involves what is known as ‘‘cap-snatching.’’
A viral endonuclease, an enzyme that digests nucleic acids internally, cuts the 5’
methylguanosine cap as well as 10–13 nucleotides adjoining it from the host RNA.
Most host mRNAs are capped at the end with 5-methylguanosine, which is the
signal for initiation of transcription. This is then added to the replicated viral RNA
for the transcription of a protein necessary for virus replication (Fig. 11.10).
Once the initial proteins are produced, eight complementary positive-sense
RNA strands are transcribed from the eight negative-sense RNA segments (at least
in inﬂuenza A and B inﬂuenza C has seven segments). From this, cRNA, a neg-
ative-sense RNA, is produced. Various proteins then help this negative-sense RNA
exit the nucleus for the cytoplasm of the host, where it interacts with viral proteins
206
11
Influenza

to be packaged. In the cytoplasm, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins
have undergone various modiﬁcations. The hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and the
two matrix proteins (M2) all travel together to the plasma membrane. There the
proteins meet with the other matrix protein (M1) and begin the budding process.
At least eight RNA segments come to the site (the mechanism is not completely
known), and the virus buds. The neuraminidase ﬁnally destroys the sialic acid
receptors on the membrane, thus allowing the virus to leave the cell. It is the
neuraminidase and the hemagglutinin that give the type speciﬁcity to the virus.
11.11 Drugs Developed Against Influenza
A number of drugs have been developed to inhibit inﬂuenza, although one of the
major problems in treating inﬂuenza is that the illness comes on very quickly and
the drugs are taken after the virus has infected the individual and thus are not
prophylactic (preventative) but decrease the symptoms. These drugs are:
• Rimantadine (Flumadine): orally administered, treats type A, only for adults.
Mechanism unknown, maybe involved in un-coating. Also a related drug,
amantadine. H1N1 strains of inﬂuenza have developed resistance to this class of
drugs.

• Oseltamivir (Tamiﬂu); orally administered, treats type A and type B. Is a
neuraminidase inhibitor. Most recommended drug. Can be used to prevent
infection. It has been proposed that in the event of a pandemic, this drug be
administered to ward off severe symptoms
• Zanamavir (Relenza): inhaled powdered drug, treats type A and type B. A
neuraminidase inhibitor.
These drugs inhibit the neuraminidase of the virus and thus do not affect normal
human cells. Although licensed for use, their effect is limited and may alleviate the
symptoms for a day or so and shorten the normal course of the disease. These
drugs cannot be used to prevent the disease, and do not prevent re-infection with
another strain of inﬂuenza.

Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses
Abstract
Poliovirus is an epidemic virus of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Although there were infections of polio in ancient times, the improvement in
sanitation in the twentieth century led to epidemic outbreaks, particularly
in western Europe and the U.S. Panic often accompanied outbreaks, particularly
in the U.S., with demands for strict quarantine, prohibition of movement of
people, and closing of places of recreation. Public interest in eradication of the
virus led to fund-raising with the ‘‘March of Dimes,’’ whose aim was to
alleviate suffering and develop a vaccine. The fact that President Roosevelt was
a victim of polio helped with the campaign. The treatment of patients with polio
was controversial; Sister Kenny claimed that exercise was important, while
other physicians recommended rest. Patients were often kept in iron lungs for a
long time. In 1955 the USPHS licensed an inactive virus vaccine, the Salk
vaccine, which was used in mass vaccination of children in the U.S. Albert
Sabin and Hilary Koprowski independently developed two attenuated viral
vaccines, which were taken orally and replaced the Salk vaccine in the 1960s.
Poliovirus belongs to the family of viruses known as picornavirus; this includes
foot and mouth disease, which is of great economic importance and outbreaks
of which have plagued the British cattle industry, and rhinoviruses—the
common cold virus.

Introduction
Growing up in Scotland in the 1940s, I was not allowed to go to the local
swimming pool or cinema during the summer because of the threat of poliovirus.
There was always fear of diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, and polio. The
condition caused by polio was known as ‘‘infantile paralysis,’’ since one of the

outcomes (although quite rare, only in about 1 % of the cases) was paralysis of the
lower limbs. In some cases death resulted, particularly among young children. The
virus not only affected the legs but also the lungs, destroying the nerves involved
in breathing.
The poliovirus has probably existed since the beginning of human history and is
now recognized to be associated with raw sewage and fecal contamination. It was
the result of ‘‘cleaning’’ the environment of human waste that resulted in polio
epidemics, and it was no longer conﬁned to young children. There was great panic
in the U.S., where polio epidemics occurred between the 1930s and 1950s. The
ﬁrst major reported epidemic occurred in Sweden in 1887 [1].
Perhaps no epidemic, except for the Black Death in the Middle Ages, and AIDS
these days, has resulted in such major social upheavals as poliomyelitis. Polio
caused panic in most of the major cities of the U.S. and western Europe in the
twentieth century. Though a large percentage of those afﬂicted by the disease
survived, a large number were severely handicapped, resulting in pressure for new
legislation dealing with disabilities and access to public, and later private, facili-
ties. Moreover, the fact that a president of the U.S. (Franklin Roosevelt) had been
stricken with polio had a tremendous impact on a search for its cause and treatment
and the development of novel ways of funding research. The creation of the
National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and ‘‘The March of Dimes’’ involved a
whole population in fundraising and medical research, and gave birth to many
organizations aimed at supporting other speciﬁc diseases.
12.2
Early History of Poliomyelitis
A stele of an Egyptian priest with a withered leg—suggestive of polio—exists from
the XVIII dynasty in Egypt (1580–1350 BCE). It shows a priest named Ruma at the
sanctuary of the goddess Astarte in Memphis supporting himself with a crutch [1]
(Fig. 12.1). The ‘‘foot drop’’ is similar to that found in cases of infantile paralysis,
and this picture indicates that polio possibly existed in ancient times, although the
withered leg could be due to other reasons. Speculation points to polio being a
biblical disease; in II Samuel there is mention of a son of Jonathan, the son of King
Saul, with a lame foot. The passage explains that this happened when the child was
ﬁve years old and fell during the ﬂight from the Philistines. Although mentioned in
the classic by William Osler (1849–1928) in his Principles and Practices of
Medicine as the ﬁrst recorded case of polio, a rereading of the biblical text does not
support this thesis, since the child was dropped and both legs were broken. There
were occasional cases of polio throughout the ages, but epidemics did not take place
until the late nineteenth century. Among those afﬂicted with polio was Sir Walter
Scott (1771–1832), the author of Ivanhoe, and the Bride of Lammermoor.
‘‘I showed every sign of health and strength until I was about eighteen months
old. One night, I have been often told, I showed great reluctance to be caught and
put to bed, and after being chased about the room, was apprehended and consigned
212

to my dormitory with some difﬁculty. It was the last time I was to show much
personal agility. In the morning I was discovered to be affected with the fever
which often accompanies the cutting of large teeth. It held me three days. On the
fourth, when they went to bathe me as usual, they discovered that I had lost the
power in my right leg. My grandfather, an excellent anatomist as well as physician,
the late worthy Alexander Wood, and many others of the most respectable of the
faculty, were consulted. There appeared to be no dislocation or sprain; blisters and
other topical remedies were applied in vain.
When the efforts of regular physicians had been exhausted, without the slightest
success, my anxious parents, during the course of many years, eagerly grasped at
every prospect of cure which was held out by the promise of empirics, or of
ancient ladies and gentlemen who conceived themselves entitled to recommend
various remedies, some of which were of a nature sufﬁciently singular.
The English physician Michael Underwood (1737–1820) in 1789 provided the
ﬁrst clinical description of polio, in his Treatise on Diseases of Children, with a
chapter on ‘‘Debility of the Lower Extremities.’’ In the chapter [2], Underwood
mentions a form of paralysis that usually ‘‘attacks children previously reduced by
fever; seldom those under one, or more than four or ﬁve years old.’’ In references

to the legs, he advocated metal braces similar to those used until fairly recently [1].
One can interpret Underwood’s reference to the time of infection since the one-
year-old is protected by maternal antibodies, but children past that age would pick
up the virus while playing in the unsanitary conditions that existed everywhere at
that time. Since it was predominantly a childhood disease, most adults were
immune and the majority of children were infected without symptoms at a young
age and acquired long-term immunity.
There are occasional mentions of polio in the medical literature prior to
twentieth century. The ﬁrst real clinical description was that of the German
physician Jacob Heine (1800–1879) in 1840. The disease for some time was
known as the Heine-Medin disease, so called after Heine and his Swedish col-
league, Karl Medin (1847–1927), who was one of the ﬁrst to describe the epidemic
nature of polio.
12.3
The Polio Epidemics
At the end of the nineteenth century, the major emphasis in the public health
movement was the eradication of diseases such as typhoid, smallpox, tuberculosis,
and cholera, all thought to be associated—rightly or wrongly—with sanitary
conditions. Prior to the nineteenth century, children were initially protected from
polio by maternal antibodies and exposed to the virus at a very young age, about
one year old, and in most cases acquired immunity. Thus, enhanced hygiene
postponed exposure to the virus until later in life, but with grave consequences.
The ﬁrst ‘‘mini-epidemic’’ of polio was a report by the Swedish physician Nils
August Bergenholtz (1816–1922), of 13 cases near the city of Umea in 1881 [3].
The ﬁrst recorded major epidemic of polio was reported in Stockholm in 1887. The
symptoms were mostly minor, with an outbreak of fever and headache, etc.
Damage to the central nervous system occurred in later stages of the illness, and in
only a few patients. Other major epidemics occurred in Norway and Sweden in
1905 and 1911.
During the 1905 epidemic, the Swedish physician Dr. Ivar Wickman
(1872–1914), a student of Karl Medin, followed the course of the disease in the
countryside, and reported that it was highly contagious and that even those who
experienced only minor symptoms could spread the virus. Such cases were termed
‘‘abortive infections.’’ He reported that patients with an abortive infection were
just as likely to spread the disease as those with a paralytic infection and that the
time between contact and transmission of the disease was only three days.
Wickman visited over 300 homes where victims resided, and although he proposed
the disease as contagious, he could not ﬁnd a link between the various victims,
who lived quite far apart. He was recognized worldwide for his work on polio-
virus, and during the great epidemic of 1911–1913, Wickman’s proposal that this
was a contagious disease was accepted. Swedish scientists suggested that polio
was a disease of the alimentary system caused by an infectious agent that entered
214
12
Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses

through the mouth and exited in the feces (oral-fecal transfer). Although presented
at international meetings, this model was rejected by the Rockefeller Institute’s
Simon Flexner, who insisted that poliovirus entered through the nose, advanced to
the brain and spinal cord, causing paralysis, and exited in the same manner [4].
Wickman performed unique studies, tracking the course of polio epidemics in
small towns, following the spread along railway lines and among school children
living on the same street. Swedish physicians noted that in areas hit hard by the
1905 epidemic, there was no subsequent outbreak in 1911, even when polio
occurred nearby, indicating that immunity could be easily established. Unfortu-
nately, Wickman suddenly committed suicide in 1914 without explanation,
although there were suspicions that he was depressed from not being offered the
position of chief pediatrician at the Karolinska Institute, a position previously held
by Karl Medin. He is now considered one of the most important pioneers in
poliovirus research and in 1958 he was posthumously honored by being inducted
into the Polio Hall of Fame in Warm Springs, Georgia, alongside Heine and
Medin.
In the summer of 1894, paralysis descended on Rutland, a small town in
Vermont. A local physician, Charles Caverly, tracked all 123 cases, noting that 50
remained paralyzed and 18 died. He thought it might have something to do with
playing in the sun, and he also realized that many children were infected with
minor symptoms with no lasting effect [5]. Caverly served as the president of the
Vermont Board of Health from 1891 until 1924, and he continued to analyze polio
outbreaks in the state of Vermont; following an outbreak in Montpelier in 1916, he
advised that a quarantine be established to prevent movement into the town and
that religious gatherings be cancelled.
As the number of cases increased in Montpelier, the city council took measures
to establish a quarantine that restricted the movements of children under 16 years
of age and prohibited them from attending all places of public gatherings such as
theaters, schools, ball games, and churches. However, with more and more cases
diagnosed daily, the local board of health and Montpelier City Council decided to
extend the quarantine by restricting the movement of children beyond their homes
(see Dorman Kent’s diary entry for June 28, 1917 in [6]). In addition to keeping
their children at home, parents were advised to disinfect their children by washing
their noses, throats, and mouths with a saline solution to prevent the spread of the
disease. This recommendation reﬂects the belief at the time that polio was spread
through nasal mucus transmission rather than by oral-fecal routes, which were
eventually shown to be the case [6]. This behavior became typical of the time.
Panic accompanied the outbreaks that occurred in the USA. The ﬁrst major
outbreak in a series occurred in New York City in 1907, with 2,500 cases and 125
deaths. The great U.S. epidemic occurred in 1916, with approximately 27,000
cases and 7,000 deaths. Even though the virus had by this time been isolated, there
were still reports that the disease was spread by moldy ﬂour, gooseberries, poi-
sonous caterpillars, and even infected milk bottles. The City of New York clamped
down with quarantines, and prevented the movement of people into the city during
12.3
The Polio Epidemics
215

the summer months. The names of people with polio in their household were
published daily in the press, and their houses were quarantined (Fig. 12.2).
The police prevented the movement of populations, and many cities refused to
allow people to pass through them. Police were stationed along the Delaware River
to prevent the entry of children into Pennsylvania; in many respects, this was like
martial law. This might have been the ﬁrst time in U.S. history that there was legal
ban on freedom of movement since the rights of the community were placed
before individual freedoms. Homes were quarantined and individuals hospitalized
or often taken away against the wishes of their families.
A 1918 report indicated that quarantine had not worked, animals had not played
any part in spreading the disease, the majority of cases were abortive, and the
disease could be spread by such individuals. In 1931 there was another epidemic,
in which 4,138 patients died, with even more paralyzed. An epidemic hit Los
Angeles in the summer months of 1934, accompanied by a great deal of hysteria
and probably exaggerated numbers, as many of the reported cases were most likely
not polio. The worst outbreaks occurred between 1942 and 1953. In 1952 there
were about 60,000 cases in the U.S. of them, 3,145 persons died and 21,269 were
disabled. This was the worst year of the U.S. epidemic. Although paralysis was
infrequent, polio caused great fear. Children were often separated from their
parents against their wishes and they did not see each other for a week or 10 days;
often the child would return home paralyzed and suffering from trauma. A large
percentage of physicians and nurses also were infected. Due to improvements in
sanitation, the disease afﬂicted both young and old, rich and poor. Outbreaks of the

disease also occurred in the British Isles and European cities. In less developed
countries, the disease occurred mostly among young children, since the adult
population was immune.
One of the puzzles of this epidemic was the random nature of the victims. I
remember being in a group where there was one case of paralytic polio in a young
person of 20. Initially we were unaware of the fact that this was the diagnosis.
Although many of us visited the sick person, sat with him and brought him food,
no one else developed the illness—and this was in the days before the polio
vaccine.
The general consensus in the USA at the time was that polio must be associated
with dirt. Immigrants were blamed for bringing in the disease, since they were
poor and lived in squalid conditions. However, improvements in waste disposal
and sanitation in the early part of the twentieth century probably made the situation
worse. Children living in poverty were most likely immune to the illness, having
been infected asymptomatically in childhood.
12.4
Discovery of the Poliovirus
In 1908 the renowned Austrian physicians Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper
isolated poliovirus from infected human tissue and from the upper respiratory tract
and gut of infected monkeys. Landsteiner had graduated from medical school in
Vienna in 1891 and returned to Vienna in 1908, at a time when Friedrich Lofﬂer
and Paul Frosch had discovered the foot and mouth disease virus (see Chap. 1). In
1908, during an epidemic of polio in Vienna, Landsteiner, working with Popper,
obtained spinal cord material from a nine-year-old boy who had died of the dis-
ease. They injected this material into two ‘‘Old World’’ monkeys, the only ones
available to them; luckily the virus replicated in the animals and developed the
symptoms of polio [7]. They isolated poliovirus from infected tissue and passaged
it through an animal system, providing a model for future studies. This was the
same Karl Landsteiner of blood group fame who was to receive the Nobel Prize for
this work in 1930.
Landsteiner then joined with Constantine Levaditi of the Pasteur Institute, and
reported the successful ﬁltration of polio through a Berkefeld ﬁlter, proving that
polio was indeed a virus. The virus could be isolated from tonsils, the lining of the
throat, from nasal ﬂuid, and from lymphocytes in the gut; Simon Flexner and Paul
Lewis at the Rockefeller Institute in New York conﬁrmed these ﬁndings. The
ability to grow the virus in an animal model (the rhesus monkey) should have
resulted in a vaccine, since Pasteur had demonstrated with rabies virus that it was
possible to passage a virus in animals and obtain an attenuated virus, so it was
expected that the same could be done with poliovirus.
Flexner was director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. He went
one step further than Landsteiner in establishing a monkey model for poliovirus,
claiming that the portal of entrance of the virus in the monkey was through the
12.3
The Polio Epidemics
217

nose. He concluded from his experiments that polio was a disease of the nervous
system, passing directly through nasal nerves to the brain and spinal cord. From
this observation he abandoned the idea of a preventative vaccine, reasoning that
antibodies could not reach the neural system. Flexner’s ideas dominated the polio
ﬁeld through the 1920s and 1930s. He encouraged the head of his virology
department, Peter Olinsky, and his assistant, Albert Sabin, to work on the problem.
His approach was to prevent the spread of polio by nasal sprays, but there was no
indication that this was successful [5].
12.5
Roosevelt and Polio
In 1921 polio devastated the man who was later to become one of America’s
greatest presidents. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was 39 when he was infected with
the virus and became paralyzed from the waist down. He had been Secretary of the
Navy in Woodrow Wilson’s cabinet during World War I and had unsuccessfully
run for Governor of New York State. He was a very energetic man, involved in
many sports and interactions with young people, particularly the Boy Scouts.
During his tenure in the government he had organized physical education for
members of the staff as well as for other cabinet members. He had been educated at
Groton, a private Episcopalian college preparatory boarding school, and then went
on to Harvard and Harvard Law School. He had grown up in very wealthy,
pampered conditions, and was probably never exposed to viruses such as polio.
Roosevelt’s name was well known nationally, being a cousin of former presi-
dent Theodore Roosevelt. He was nominated as vice-presidential candidate to
Governor James Cox of Indiana in an unsuccessful campaign against Warren
Harding. During this period he was the picture of health. After losing the election,
he returned to his law ﬁrm in New York to prepare for the next political battle, the
governorship of the State of New York. He also volunteered to be president of the
Boy Scout Foundation of New York. He visited and stayed at a Boy Scout camp at
Bear Mountain on the Hudson River in July 27, 1921, and from there he sailed a
few days later with a friend to the family’s retreat at Campobello Island off the
coast of Maine. During the ﬁrst few days in Campobello he was very active,
playing with his children and swimming, and again the picture of good health. On
August 10, he suddenly felt too tired to dress for dinner and retired early, not
feeling well. When he awoke in the morning he had a fever and had difﬁculty
getting out of bed, his left leg dragging. As the day wore on, he lost all ability to
move either leg and was in great pain. He may have picked up polio from his stay
with the Boy Scouts, although this was two weeks after his stay there (the normal
incubation period is 3–7 days).
The local physician was called and he diagnosed the condition as a cold, but he
was worried about the situation and looked for some help in the area. He found Dr.
William Williams Keen, who had performed surgery on President Cleveland in
1893. Keen had been the ﬁrst to perform brain surgery in the U.S. However, on
218
12
Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses

examining Roosevelt, he misdiagnosed the illness as a blood clot causing loss of
power in the lower body and he recommended heavy massage, which increased the
pain. After 10 days the family found Dr. Robert Lovette, an orthopedist from
Rhode Island, who conﬁrmed the diagnosis of polio.
For adults, polio was much more severe than in children. It was exceedingly
difﬁcult for Roosevelt to accept being an invalid, and he tried to hide it most of his
life, by rarely showing himself standing (which he could not do without support).
Most pictures show him sitting behind a desk, or in a wheelchair covered with a
blanket since he was very embarrassed by his disability. Without his wheelchair,
he had to drag himself along the ﬂoor or require assistance in moving. Very few
saw the man as an invalid.
Despite this condition, Roosevelt decided to continue his political career. He
enforced on himself a strict regimen of exercise, and found swimming a great help
since in the water he did not feel as encumbered as he did on land (Fig. 12.3).
In 1924, a friend, George Foster Peabody, introduced Roosevelt to a spa he
owned in Western Georgia where the mineral-laden water comes gushing out at
88 Roosevelt felt good bathing in the water, which relieved his pain, and allowed
him to stand without aid. In 1926, Roosevelt bought Warm Springs, then a run-
down thermal springs resort, and turned it into a polio rehabilitation center, for-
mally incorporating it as the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, a nonproﬁt
company eligible for tax-free gifts [5]. This became a major rehabilitation center,
later promoted by the March of Dimes. It was open to paying victims of polio, and
later to all who could get outside support. Eleanor Roosevelt said that if her
husband had not become involved in politics, he would have been manager of this

rehabilitation spa. Although turned down by the American Orthopedic Associa-
tion, initially as a rehabilitation center, it was later approved. To help pay for those
unable to afford treatment, Basil O’Connor, Roosevelt’s former law partner,
established a fund to support such individuals and their treatment at the spa. This
fund developed into the National Foundation for Poliomyelitis, later known as the
National Foundation, and gave rise to the March of Dimes (see below). Roosevelt
visited Warm Springs every year for rehabilitation and built what became known
as ‘‘The Little White House,’’ where he would work and at the same time have
access to the warm pool. Roosevelt died at the Little White House’’ in April of
1945; today it is a Georgia State Park.
From our perspective today, there was one major problem with Warm Springs:
no blacks (African-Americans) were allowed because most of the medical facili-
ties established in the Southern States of the USA banned African-Americans. In
fact, there was a theory, proposed in part by members of the medical establish-
ment, that African-Americans were not susceptible to polio. It is true that there
were fewer African-American patients than white, Caucasian patients, but this
reﬂected early exposure to the virus and state of hygiene in the neglected African-
American community. There were many fewer cases of polio in general in the
southern states than in the northern states, due to poorer sanitation. It was not until
the 1930s Presidential election that the question of segregation in Georgia Warm
Springs arose. Despite discussion the Georgia Warm Springs continued to be
segregated. In 1941, a similar facility for African-American victims of polio was
opened in Tuskegee, Alabama [8]. Today, the March of Dimes is still active and
concentrates its efforts on birth defects, obviously without discrimination. The
Georgia Warm Springs was sold to the state of Georgia for one dollar in 1974.
12.6
The March of Dimes
During this period we saw the establishment of the National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis, and an offshoot. The March of Dimes campaign, which was the
model for subsequent charitable medical organizations. One of the driving forces
behind the campaign to ﬁnd a cure was Franklin D. Roosevelt. A unique aspect of
this epidemic was the use of mass communication at the time—radio—for fund-
raising and support of research.
From the March of Dimes Web site: http://www.marchofdimes.com/mission/
eddie-cantor-and-the-origin-of-the-march-of-dimes.aspx
Comedian Eddie Cantor (1892–1964) holds a very special place in the history
of poliovirus research for it was he who coined the phrase ‘‘March of Dimes’’ used
to identify the Foundation National Foundation. Eddie Cantor was a multi-talented
performer—vaudeville star, singer, actor, comedian, radio and television person-
ality—whose rise to fame began in the New York City theatrical revue, the
Ziegfeld Follies, in 1917. Beloved by the American public and known as ‘‘banjo
eyes’’ for his wide-eyed visage, Eddie Cantor had a deep well of compassion to
220
12
Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses

match his enormous talent, for he embraced a variety of humanitarian causes over
the course of his long career in show business. One of these was the March of
Dimes, and the story of how he created this name has special distinction.
Beginning in 1934, the ﬁght against poliomyelitis (also known as infantile
paralysis, or polio) was commonly associated with the annual Birthday Balls held
each January 30th in honor of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s birthday. These
lively fundraising parties were organized by Basil O’Connor, a Roosevelt advisor
and lawyer. In cities throughout the United States just as the country emerged from
the Great Depression and were unique in their appeal to ordinary citizens to join the
campaign of ﬁnding a solution to this dreaded disease. After FDR issued his proc-
lamation announcing the creation of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
on September 23, 1937, to carry on the battle against polio on a national basis, it was
left to Eddie Cantor and other promoters to organize a fundraising strategy for the
next Birthday Balls in California. On November 22, 1937, Cantor met with
W. S. Van Dyke II and Harry Mazlish of Warner Brothers in the ofﬁce of John
Considine, Jr. in the studios of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to discuss their plans. In the
meeting, Cantor recalled a successful 30-second radio appeal for relief funds after a
catastrophic Mississippi River ﬂood. Applying this idea to the National Foundation,
Cantor said, ‘I am sure that all of the national radio programs originating in Hol-
lywood would devote 30 s to this great cause’ He suggested that the money raised
could be directed to the White House, pending the approval of the President. After
another moment of reﬂection he suggested, ‘We could call it the March of Dimes.’
This idea brought the general approval of everyone in the meeting; it was a play on
the ‘March of Times,’ the local newsreels shown in cinemas.
Eddie Cantor was not the only ‘star’ involved in the March of Dimes. Holly-
wood stars became very involved, including Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, and
many others. This later developed into a pattern where ﬁlm stars and later tele-
vision personalities were used in fund raising for many different charities, and of
course in our times for election campaigns. An advert for the March of dimes is
shown in Fig. 12.4.
The March of Dimes was a huge success, and brought in millions of dollars,
which were used to develop the polio vaccine, ﬁrst announced by Salk in 1955 and
Sabin a few years later. The campaign was enhanced by the use of radio and later
television. Between 1938 and 1962 the NFIP raised $630 million. The NFIP mission
was threefold, to care for polio victims, research and training of medical personnel,
and disseminate general information on the disease. Today the March of Dimes
continues to support research into birth defects and genetic diseases of children.
12.7
Treatment for Polio
One of the symptoms of polio infection was the paralysis of the nerves controlling
breathing and resulting suffocation. Philip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw at

They devised a version of a tank respirator that could artiﬁcially maintain respi-
ration until a person could breathe independently, usually after a week or two. The
machine was powered by an electric motor with two vacuum cleaners; the pump
changed the pressure inside a rectangular, airtight metal box, pulling air in and out
of the lungs. These were large contraptions with ‘‘windows’’ so that nurses could
look in on the patients. Beds were adjusted so that they could slide into the iron
lung. In 1930 an iron lung cost about $1,500—the average price of a home. Money
for iron lungs was collected and distributed by the National Foundation for
Infantile Paralysis (two examples are shown in Fig. 12.5).
The method of treatment of withered limbs, such as the legs and arms, was also
controversial, with Sister Elizabeth Kenny of Australia advocating physiotherapy
as a treatment, in order to restore feeling in the muscles of diseased legs and arms.
Others wanted to maintain the withered limbs in casts or plaster. Sister Kenny,
from a small town in rural Australia, worked as a nurse during World War 1, and
on her return to Australia treated children who had muscle injuries from accidents,
and later treated children with polio. She was not aware of the standard treatment
at the time, and developed her own methodology. Instead of immobilizing affected
limbs in casts or stents, she used hot packs and massage to loosen afﬂicted mus-
cles. She reported some success in getting children to walk who had previously
been paralyzed. She then established clinics in Western Australia, but ended up at

odds with the medical establishment over her methods. She also established
treatment centers all over the U.S. and had her headquarters in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. She was one of the founders of the science of physical therapy, and her
methodology is still quite acceptable today [9, 10].
In the U.S., the response to the polio epidemic was a philanthropic and public
one with little interference from the government. Canada was also hard hit by
outbreaks of polio but here the response differed because in Canada the provincial
governments took over the care of victims of polio and paid for hospitalization and
treatment. In fact, it could be looked at as the beginnings of the Canadian health
insurance system.
12.8
Development of a Polio Vaccine
In 1935, two separate teams were at work developing and testing a polio vaccine.
Both projects came to disastrous ends. At New York University, Maurice Brodie,
MD (1903–1939), a young Canadian researcher, prepared a killed poliovirus
vaccine, testing it on chimpanzees, on himself, and ﬁnally on children. He used
polio grown in monkey spinal cords, and inactivated the virus with formalin. When
injected into monkeys, the animals produced antibodies to the virus—indicating an
active vaccine. Park, the department head, and Brodie self-injected the virus, with
no adverse results. He enrolled and injected about 11,000 individuals (in both
control and vaccine groups) in a vaccine trial. The results were inconclusive, and
the vaccine produced an allergic response in a number of children, possibly due to
the presence of monkey myelin basic protein [5]. Meanwhile, John Kolmer, MD,
Fig. 12.5 a and b Iron lungs (Wikipedia)
12.7
Treatment for Polio
223

of Temple University in Philadelphia, developed an attenuated poliovirus vaccine.
He vaccinated himself, his two sons and 23 other children—with no adverse
effects. He then went on to vaccinate 10,000 other children. The tests proved to be
a disaster. Nine subjects died of polio, and many were paralyzed, became ill, or
suffered allergic reactions to the vaccines (CDC-history of vaccines). These were
tragic cases both for those vaccinated as well as for the researchers. Both trials
were done in haste because of public pressure, and the researchers did not take into
account the possibility of monkey viruses or monkey proteins in their preparations.
Brodie’s career was ﬁnished and he died at the age of 36, possibly a suicide.
Progress on a vaccine was delayed by the ideas of Simon Flexner, director of the
Polio Laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute. The rhesus monkey is not susceptible
to polio in the same way as humans, and the virus does not replicate in the gas-
trointestinal tract of monkeys. Because of passage of the virus through the monkeys,
the strain isolated and grown in most laboratories had been adapted to monkey
neural tissue and was not the same virus that attacked humans. The strain that
emerged from these passages was called the ‘‘MV’’ strain. This mistake was a costly
one in lives and it delayed the development of the ‘‘real’’ vaccine by some 20 years.
Because of these failures, and the continuing toll of the disease, Basil O’Connor
appointed Thomas Rivers, director of the Rockefeller Institute Hospital, to head
the National Foundation Committee on Scientiﬁc Research. Rivers set down a list
of priorities that had to be answered in order to continue research towards a
vaccine. These included basic questions, such as how the virus gets into a person,
how is it spread, and the characterization and life cycle of the virus. Groups of
scientists received grants to investigate these questions. Another question that
needed answering was how many species of polio virus are there?
In 1941 Albert Sabin performed autopsies on polio victims and found that the
virus was plentiful in the digestive tract but not in nasal tissue. It was clear that this
was an enterovirus, entered through the mouth and replicated in the gut. By 1948
there was a major breakthrough, (already discussed in Chap. 3 of this book), when
John Franklin Enders and his colleagues discovered that poliovirus could be grown
in cell culture, in embryonic skin, and in muscle cells. The virus could now be
grown in large amounts in culture. This paved the way for the possible develop-
ment of a vaccine. The true nature of the virus had been discovered and its mode of
transmission, and it was now possible to grow the virus in large quantities.
The National Foundation approached Dr. Jonas Salk, a young researcher at the
University of Pittsburgh with a grant to investigate whether there were two or three
different species of polio affecting man. If there were multiple species, then a
vaccine would be required against all of them. Salk’s laboratory tested clinical
samples from all over the U.S. In 1949 it was reported that there were three serotypes
[11]. Meanwhile, in 1949 Dr. Isabel Morgan showed that formalin could inactivate
the virus and when injected into monkeys protect them from polio [12, 13].
Independently, Lederle, a pharmaceutical company in New York State, in 1945
had hired Dr. Hilary Koprowski, a refugee from Warsaw University’s Medical
School. He did research on the Lansing strain of poliovirus (the most pathogenic
strain) and passaged it through the brains of mice and cotton rats, and after 30 or so
224
12
Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses

passages isolated a weakened virus that he fed to nine chimpanzees. All nine were
protected from polio. He then drank the material himself, as did his colleague,
Thomas Norton. Apparently it tasted like cod liver oil, something that those of us
who were children during World War II remember well [14]. This was the ﬁrst
trial of an oral vaccine.
This vaccine was the ﬁrst tested in children in the U.S. In early 1950 Koprowski
administered the vaccine to children at a home for the ‘‘feeble-minded and epi-
leptic’’ in New York State. Twenty-one children were vaccinated with no ill effect,
and all developed neutralizing antibodies. This was kept secret until a conference
of the National Foundation in 1951. Koprowski went on to produce other atten-
uated strains of virus, taking advantage of growing the virus in cell culture. A
shake-up in the company in 1954 resulted in Koprowski leaving Lederle, by now
American Cyanamid and he became director of the Wistar Institute in
Philadelphia.
Koprowski and Sabin were both working on an attenuated vaccine. It was their
belief, and that of Enders and others in the ‘‘polio establishment,’’ that only an
attenuated vaccine would work. Jonas Salk was a relative newcomer to the group
and was not easily accepted by them. He graduated from NYU in 1939, and
completed his internship at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. While at NYU, he had
come to the attention of Thomas Francis, a professor of Microbiology; this later
proved a useful contact. After completing his internship and not being able to ﬁnd
another position, he applied for a position at the Department of Epidemiology at
the University of Michigan, where Francis was now chairman. Together they
worked on inactivating inﬂuenza virus with formalin to produce a vaccine for the
army. In 1947 he applied for an independent position, and found one at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical School. He brought with him a grant to continue
working on inﬂuenza, but he also received funding from the National Foundation
to perform polio typing. By 1951, with the end of the typing experiments, proving
that only three strains of polio existed in the wild, he received more grants than
anyone else at the medical school.
By 1950 Salk had tested both live attenuated and killed poliovirus in monkeys,
and he was now ready to test his killed vaccine in people. In December 1951 an
expert committee was convened by the Director of the National Foundation to
consider Salk’s request to start treating children with the vaccine. The committee,
among whom were Sabin and Enders, turned the idea down, considering it too
dangerous, and they wanted to wait until Sabin had completed his work on an
attenuated vaccine. However, there was great pressure to do something, so the
administration of the National Foundation agreed to perform vaccination with
Salk’s vaccine in secret, just as Koprowski had done around the same time. The
State of Pennsylvania approved the plan to test the vaccine on children in the
Watson Home for crippled children—most of them crippled by polio—and in a
school for the mentally retarded and feebleminded. Testing began in June 1952,
when 42 children in the Watson Home were given the vaccine with no ill effects,
and with a general rise in antibody titer. This was the most suitable group of
children for a trial since they would all be immune to polio (at least one strain of it)
12.8

225

and would already have antibodies. Salk then tested the vaccine in the home for
retarded children, again with no ill effects. At a meeting of the National Foun-
dation Immunization Committee, Salk presented his data: he had vaccinated 161
children with his vaccine. It caused a commotion with Sabin, Enders and others,
believing that much more research was needed and that it was too premature. 1952
was one of the worst years for polio, and by the year’s end more than 20,000 had
been paralyzed and 3,000 had died [5].
In contrast to the Koprowski trials, Salk leaked his results to a newspaper
correspondent and in February 1953, Time Magazine carried the news. Salk
emphasized that the results were preliminary and that there was the need for a
large trial before declaring the vaccine a complete success. As expected, Sabin,
Enders, and others were shocked by the news. The National Foundation, however,
convened a new committee to design a large-scale trial. There was, as expected,
much discussion on the form of the trial. A large number of children would have to
be vaccinated in order to test the efﬁcacy of the vaccine, since paralysis (or death)
affected only a small percentage of the infected. There was a proposal to perform a
double-blind study, in which half the children would receive a placebo and the
other half the actual vaccine. None of the administrators of the vaccine would
know who was receiving the actual vaccine, and the data would be analyzed after
the trial was ﬁnished, so this would avoid bias in the analysis. Sabin argued that
the Salk vaccine was not ready for testing, and after strenuous arguments, the idea
of the double-blind test was abandoned.
Rather than give up, Basil O’Connor and others on the committee of the National
Foundation asked Thomas Francis, known to be a meticulous scientist, to oversee a
large trial. He reinstated the idea of a double-blind trial, with a placebo given to half
the children. Because the frequency of active infection—as opposed to abortive
infection—was so low, half a million children would have to be vaccinated to make
the trial statistically meaningful. Over 600,000 children between the ages of seven
and eight would receive three injections over an eight-week period. To obtain
enough vaccine, the National Foundation arranged commercial contracts with
Connaught Laboratories of Canada, Parke Davis, and later Eli Lilly and Wyeth.
Some smaller laboratories, such as Cutter, were also involved, with Eli Lilly and
Park Davis suppling most of the vaccines. By the end of June 1954, vaccination of
the children was complete and on April 12, 1955, Francis announced the results of
the trial. Comparing vaccine- and placebo- injected groups, the Salk vaccine was
80–90 % effective. The excitement of that day, and the events following the
announcement, were captured in an excellent book, The End of Plagues [5]. The
vaccine was quickly licensed by the newly created Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare, and Jonas Salk was proclaimed a hero.
On April 24, a six-year-old girl developed the symptoms of polio six days after
receiving the vaccine; she died three days later. Thus began a series of polio cases
that eventually reached 200. They were all traced to one batch of vaccine, prepared
by Cutter. After investigation, it was found that faulty ﬁlters were used, which
allowed clumps of virus, some not inactive, to get through the preparation. Once this
glitch had been found, the Salk vaccine proved safe. The number of annual cases of
226
12
Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses

polio plummeted from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957. In 1961, only 161 cases
were recorded in the U.S. Thus, despite the many misgivings, the vaccine worked.
Sabin continued to work on his vaccine, and clinical trials began in 1954 at
Chillicothe Federal Penitentiary in Ohio. The trial was a success with high anti-
body titer being induced. Despite the Cold War, President Eisenhower had
promised to cooperate with the Russians on defeating polio. In 1956 a Russian
delegation arrived in the U.S. to assess the Salk and Sabin vaccines, and the
Russians chose to use Sabin’s. In 1959, 10 million Russian children were suc-
cessfully vaccinated, proving that the Sabin vaccine strains were safe and effective.
The Russian authorities then proposed the vaccination of every Russian under the
age of 20, and a massive campaign was undertaken to vaccinate 70 million people;
the vaccine worked.
In 1960, Lederle Laboratories revived the Koprowski vaccine, which could be
given in one oral dose. A trial was launched in Florida, with 400,000 receiving the
vaccine. A few cases of polio occurred; whether they were caused by or related to
the vaccine is unknown, but this was the deciding factor in licensing the Sabin
vaccine for use in the U.S. Although the Salk vaccine worked well, and by 1961
the occurrence of polio was considerably decreased, the American Medical
Association demanded clariﬁcation on which vaccine to use. In September 1961
the USPHS licensed the Sabin vaccine for use in the U.S., and by 1979 polio had
been eliminated from the U.S.
The Koprowski vaccine was eventually used in Africa. However, Koprowski
never received the acclaim he deserved, perhaps owing to his work in industry or due
to his larger-than-life personality. The National Foundation did not support his
research (see http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/us/hilary-koprowski-developed-
live-virus-polio-vaccine-dies-at-96.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0).
Today polio is almost non-existent in the U.S. and almost completely eradicated
world-wide, although there are still a few holdouts where complete vaccination has
not occurred, such as India and certain regions of Africa.
The success in developing a polio vaccine was due to the ease of growing the virus
in culture, particularly in non-neural tissue (although this took a long time of trial and
error) and because the virus had no animal reservoir. The development of these
vaccines allowed for mass vaccination. Utilizing the Sabin attenuated vaccine, herd
immunity could be established in populations, since this attenuated virus could rep-
licate and spread in a population without causing any of the symptoms of the disease.
Although it was assumed that by 2010 polio would be wiped out worldwide,
this has not been the case. There have been sporadic outbreaks in India, particu-
larly among undernourished children, who do not seem to respond to the vaccine,
and in parts of Africa where there has been resistance to vaccination. However,
this year it appears that polio is close to being eradicated in Nigeria, where a few
cases have been reported. Other sources of polio are Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The World Health Organization and the Indian government, in the hope that the
virus has ﬁnally been eradicated or close to eradication, have carried out a massive
campaign against polio. Recently, polio workers were murdered in Pakistan, and
resistance to evacuation has increased in Nigeria due to Islamic Fundamentalists

who see a ‘‘Western plot.’’ Within the last few weeks of writing this chapter, there
have been outbreaks of polio in Syria, due to the upheavals caused by the civil war;
ﬁghters may have brought the virus from Pakistan (Table 12.1).

Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses

12.9
Picornaviruses
Picornaviruses have played an important role in the history of virology (see
Chap. 1). One of the ﬁrst diseases identiﬁed as viral was Foot and Mouth Disease
virus of cattle by Friedrich Loefﬂer in 1897. In more recent times, picornaviruses
have also been used as models for studying virus replication and virus structure,
due to the ease in growing such viruses in culture and the high yields obtained.
Poliovirus was among the ﬁrst animal viruses to be shown to undergo
self-assembly in the test tube and the ﬁrst viruses produced from RNA in vitro
[15, 16].
As the name suggests, these are small (‘‘pico’’), single-stranded RNA viruses.
This family of virus contains 12 different genera: enterovirus, which includes polio
and rhinovirus, the common cold virus; apthovirus, which includes foot and mouth
disease virus of cattle; and hepatovirus, which includes hepatitis A. A major reason
for lack of immunity to the common cold is that there are 100 or so unique
antigenic strains (serotypes), strains that are constantly arising as a result of
mutations in the RNA.
These viruses are small icosahedron structures (see Chap. 2), typically with four
different coat polypeptides wrapped around single-stranded RNA (Fig. 12.6). This
single-stranded RNA is termed ‘‘+polarity’’ since the RNA immediately acts a
messenger RNA for the synthesis of enzymes used in viral replication. Thus viral
replication and translation of the mRNA into viral proteins necessary for repli-
cation, and viral coat proteins, occur simultaneously. Picornaviruses have very
limited information content, coding for only ﬁve or six proteins. When the virus
attaches to the cell receptor, the virus is surrounded by the cell membrane to form
a vesicle that is taken into the cell cytoplasm, and the pH of the vesicle changes,
resulting in un-coating of the virus (Fig. 12.7). The viral RNA is translated into a
long polyprotein that is then cleaved into individual proteins that will eventually
form the four viral coat proteins and enzymes necessary for viral replication and
processing of proteins. At the same time, the enzyme responsible for viral repli-
cation (replicase), is synthesized from the input strand of RNA and results in the
copying of the RNA into a complementary RNA, which in turn is copied back into
the + strand viral RNA. Part or all of these + and - strand RNAs may form
double-stranded RNA structures through complementary binding. This dou-
ble-stranded RNA plays a role in activating the immune and interferon response
that occurs in vivo by binding to toll-like receptors. The protein coats accumulate
in one part of the cell and the nucleic acid in another. By a mechanism still not
completely understood, the assembly of the virus occurs either in unique structures
in the cell known as Golgi bodies, or on internal membrane structures (endo-
plasmic reticulum), in which the viral proteins are wrapped around the folded
RNA or empty capsids are formed into which the RNA is packaged, and hundreds
12.9
Picornaviruses
229

of thousands of viral particles are released from the cell. In the case of most
picornaviruses, the cells are lysed (destroyed) by the large amounts of virus
released. The structure of the virus and mechanism of viral replication are illus-
trated in Figs. 12.6 and 12.7.

Poliovirus and Other Picornaviruses

12.10 Foot and Mouth Disease Virus
Although FMDV is not a human virus, it has had a major impact on the economies
of many western European countries, particularly that of the U.K. This virus also
belongs to the picornavirus family (apthovirus). It causes high fever, lesions in the
mouth and on the legs (hoofs), and lameness in many domestic animals including
cattle, pigs, goats and deer. It has low mortality but can affect milk production over
a long period of time. However, mortality in young animals is high. The virus can
be spread by contact between animals, is found in animal excretions, and can even
be transmitted by the wind and carried in clothing. Many countries live with the
disease and vaccinate their herds of cattle, while other countries have found it
more economically efﬁcient not to vaccinate the cattle, and attempt to cull them if
necessary in order to be free of the disease. This allows for greater export of meat
products; the U.S., for example, has such a policy. The U.K. has tried this policy
but has had many outbreaks of FMDV, so rather than vaccinate against the disease,
they have followed a policy of mass slaughter of infected herds, and nearby herds.
Cattle and people have been strictly ‘‘quarantined’’ during periods of outbreaks.
The mass slaughter of cattle has taken a heavy toll on British agriculture. Vac-
cination is banned in the EU in an attempt to eliminate the disease by culling. To
me as a virologist, this seems short-sighted, since the cost of mass slaughter is
prohibitive and has not been successful in eliminating the disease in the long run.
The arguments against vaccination are that it would be difﬁcult to identify which
animals have had FMDV from those vaccinated. However, new vaccines that use
recombinant adenovirus-FMDV combinations are being developed. These vac-
cines would only express some of the FMDV proteins and not others, thus
allowing for differentiation between true infection and vaccinated animals. Taiwan
and some countries of western Europe have adopted vaccination rather than
wholesale slaughter, or a combination of both. This approach has also been sup-
ported by top-notch scientists working at Pirbright and Plum Island, the two major
centers of FMDV research. The virus is endemic in parts of Asia, the Middle East
and South America; it does undergo mutation at a high rate, making it difﬁcult to
develop a long-lasting vaccine. Luckily, most meat-producing countries have been
FMDV-free for a considerable time, with the last major outbreak in the U.S. in
1927.
The last major foot and mouth epidemic in the United Kingdom occurred in
2001, with a smaller outbreak in 2007. The total costs arising from the 2001
outbreak have been put at no less than £9 billion, with at least £3 billion in direct
costs to the public sector and about £5 billion in costs to tourism and the rural
economy. Out of the total costs incurred during the outbreak, compensation to
farmers for the slaughter of their animals and welfare reasons were placed at £1.34
billion. The cause of this outbreak may have been pigswill that was not completely
boiled and processed according to law; it also contained contaminated meat.
During this outbreak, over ten million sheep and cattle were killed. Tourist trade in
the Lake District, a major tourist area, was closed off. (For a description of the
12.10
Foot and Mouth Disease Virus
231

conditions in the U.K., and a critique of the handling of the outbreaks, see. http://
www.numberwatch.co.uk/lest_we_forget.htm).
I visited the U.K. in 2001 spending my vacation in the south of the country, not
the hardest-hit area, although large segments of Dorset were off-limits. Many parts
of Britain, including parkland, were closed to the public. One had to walk through
troughs of disinfectant while hiking in the country. Not only was this a great cost
to the farmers, it also cost the hotels and other business catering to tourists dearly.
The picture is not a pleasant one, with hundreds of head of cattle being slaughtered
and then burned and the smoke and odor spreading throughout the countryside.

Hepatitis
Abstract
There are many viruses that cause hepatitis. In this chapter we discuss three
of them: hepatitis A (jaundice), hepatitis B (serum hepatitis), and hepatitis
C. Hepatitis A is an acute infection, whereas hepatitis B and C are blood-borne
diseases and cause chronic infections and eventually cirrhosis of the liver and
liver cancer. Outbreaks of hepatitis A were once very common in most of the
world, since it was spread by unsanitary conditions Hepatitis A disrupted military
campaigns throughout the ages. A vaccine is now available, and hepatitis A has
almost disappeared from the developed world. A recombinant vaccine has also
been developed against hepatitis B, resulting in a decline in cases. A vaccine is
not yet available for hepatitis C, although there is active research in this area.
Until recently Hepatitis C was routinely treated with a combination of interferon
and ribavirin, which had severe side effects and low cure rates. This treatment is
being replaced by nucleotides/nucleosides analogues that inhibit viral protein
processing and replication enzymes. The large numbers of hepatitis B cases in the
world are due to sexual transmission and mother-to-child transfer. The sharing of
needles when using recreational drugs, blood transfusions, and unsanitary tattoo
parlors—all these spread hepatitis C. All three viruses infect millions of people
worldwide.
13.1
What Is Hepatitis?
The term ‘‘hepatitis’’ refers to an inﬂammation of the liver usually accompanied by
increases in liver-speciﬁc enzymes; it is also known as ‘‘jaundice.’’ Alcohol use,
toxins, speciﬁc prescription drugs, or a virus can cause this condition. The
symptoms of hepatitis include yellowing of the eyes and skin due to an increase in
bilirubin (a breakdown product of heme in the blood or from the bile duct),

clay-colored feces, fatigue, vomiting, and nausea. The yellowing of the eyes and
skin are the most obvious symptoms. Three major viruses known as hepatitis A, B,
and C, which reﬂect the order in which they were discovered, cause hepatitis. The
above-mentioned symptoms are common to all three viral infections. In the last
few years, there were about 1,300 cases of hepatitis A each year in the U.S., in
contrast to the hundreds of thousands reported before the introduction of a vaccine
(see Fig. 13.1). All children at age 1, and adults when they travel to countries with
a high occurrence of the disease, are currently vaccinated. Hepatitis A infections
result from contaminated food and unsanitary conditions and is most common in
countries around the Mediterranean and the Far East. In the U.S. in the past,
outbreaks have been associated with contaminated meat, vegetables and seafood.
13.2
History of Jaundice
Jaundice has a long history. Hippocrates mentions it in his work Epidemics, and
the Babylonian Talmud of the ﬁfth century A.D. discusses ‘‘yerakon’’ (greenish),
an allusion in the Bible to a greenish pallor of people, or yellowing of plants (a
controversial translation of the Hebrew). In the Talmud, yerakon is interpreted as a
disease similar to modern-day jaundice. Pope Zacharias, who is credited with
recommending quarantine for the disease, recognized it as a communicable disease
in the eighth century [1]. It reached epidemic proportions with the increased
populations of European cities in the seventeenth–nineteenth centuries, and was
particularly rampant during military campaigns, where there was overcrowding of
troops in unsanitary conditions. From the seventeenth century onwards, jaundice
among soldiers increasingly became a hazard of military life and was reported

from many theaters of war—in the Netherlands in the War of the Austrian Suc-
cession (1740–1748), in Egypt during Napoleon’s brief incursion there (1798), and
in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War (1870) [1].
There were more than 40,000 cases among 2,000,000 soldiers on the Union side
in the American Civil War (1861–1865), 6,000 cases among almost half a million
British and Dominion soldiers in the Boer War in South Africa (1899–1902), and
huge numbers of Japanese sailors in the war against Russia (1904–1905). In the
Middle East campaign of World War I, it affected up to 25 % of some units.
During World War II, over 5,000,000 soldiers and civilians on the German side,
and more than 150,000 U.S. army soldiers suffered from hepatitis [2]. In the battle
of El Alamein in the Libyan desert, there was an outbreak of hepatitis among
Australian and German troops at the frontline; this was possibly due to the large
numbers of dead bodies and feces in the ﬁeld of action. During the Italian cam-
paign, American troops suffered greatly from jaundice at a rate of 37 cases per
1,000 soldiers. Of about 16,000 cases, each one spent an average of six weeks in
hospital. A delay in D-day by one month may have resulted from 22,000 cases
reported before June 1944 [3]. Thus, this disease had a profound effect on military
history, as we have also seen for smallpox and inﬂuenza. Most of this was due to
hepatitis A.
13.3
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A is a self-limiting acute infection, which may last from a few weeks to a
few months. The virus is a picornavirus, from the same family as polio and other
enteroviruses and is spread by oral-fecal transmission. Hepatitis A appears
cyclically in the U.S. with peaks every 15 or so years. Since the introduction of the
vaccine in 1996, the number of cases has decreased considerably (Fig. 13.1) and it
is no longer considered a hazard in the U.S. or Western Europe. Hepatitis A
infections still occur frequently in Africa, South America and parts of Asia
(Fig. 13.2). Hepatitis A vaccine was introduced incrementally in 1996, ﬁrst for
children dwelling in communities with the highest rates of disease, and expanded
in 1999 to children living in states/communities with consistently elevated rates of
infection
(http://www.immunizationinfo.org/vaccines/hepatitis).
The
level
of
hepatitis A infection is now the same in most areas of the U.S. There are a number
of different vaccines available, both attenuated virus and inactive (dead) virus.
A new vaccine containing hepatitis A and hepatitis B antigens was introduced in
the U.S. in 2001 for persons age 18 or older.
An outbreak of hepatitis A involving 601 patients and three fatalities occurred
in November 2003, associated with a restaurant in Pennsylvania; [4] the cause of
the infection was salsa that contained green onions grown in northern Mexico.
Another outbreak of hepatitis A occurred in the U.S. in the spring-summer of 2013,
making 168 people sick; it was tracked down to a frozen berry mixture that
contained pomegranate seeds imported from Turkey. A similar eruption occurred
13.2
History of Jaundice
235

in 2012 in British Columbia, and also in Europe, from pomegranate seeds imported
from Egypt; none of those who became ill had been vaccinated.
An unusual feature of the virus has only recently been discovered. Although
hepatitis A is a picornavirus, a non-enveloped virus, some particles isolated from
the blood of infected individuals have a membranous envelope around them, [5]
which may be a mechanism whereby the virus avoids neutralization by antibodies.
13.4
Hepatitis B
The detection of the other hepatitis viruses, now known as hepatitis B and hepatitis
C, called for a time non-A, non-B, is a fascinating story. Hepatitis B virus, at one
time known as ‘‘serum hepatitis,’’ was found by accident although viral causes of
liver disease other than hepatitis A was suspected for some time.
Dr. Baruch Blumberg travelled throughout the world in the 1950s collecting
blood samples in order to analyze serum proteins, particularly those from hemo-
philiacs, receiving blood from many different sources. His purpose was to examine
whether such blood contained antibodies to ‘‘foreign’’ antigens that originated from
the transfused blood. He discovered a unique antigen, termed the ‘‘Australia anti-
gen‘‘in the serum of an Australian aborigine that reacted with an antibody found in
leukemia patients and in the blood of inmates of institutions such as prisons and old
age homes. It was not present in the normal serum of adults in the U.S. Blumberg

Hepatitis

proposed that this antigen was connected with either the onset or presence of an
agent responsible for leukemia. This antigen was also present in a relatively high
percentage of Taiwanese [6] and later found in serum of individuals in mental
institutions, e.g., Down’s syndrome patients, and also occasionally in persons
diagnosed with hepatitis or hemophilia. A lab technician working in the Blumberg
lab with Australia antigen, serum converted—that is, her blood now contained
antibodies to the Australia antigen and she developed mild symptoms of hepatitis.
Another lab associate whose job it was to inject the antigen into rabbits also sero-
converted. The antigen was later identiﬁed in some patients who underwent blood
transfusions, and also in a group of patients with symptoms of hepatitis but not those
with other liver diseases such as alcohol induced cirrhosis. Blumberg and colleagues
[7] initially proposed that this factor was a genetic autosomal inherited factor, and
family studies revealed that the antigen could be transmitted from mother to child.
These data, and the two accidental cases described above, indicated that the
antigen was an infectious agent and not a genetic condition [8]. It was hypothe-
sized that the Australia antigen was linked to a virus related to hepatitis. Electron
micrographs indicated that the antigen had characteristics of a virus-like particle,
about the size of a picornavirus (Fig. 13.3). This antigen, initially termed ‘‘Aus-
tralia antigen’’ was later called ‘‘hepatitis B surface antigen’’ (HBsAg). As shown
in Fig. 13.4, it is present during the acute phase of the disease.
Baruch Blumberg, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, made a point of the
fact that his research on antigen polymorphisms accidently led to the discovery of
the virus. By 1966 Blumberg and his colleagues were convinced that Australia
antigen was associated with serum hepatitis, that it might be a virus, and that it was
transmitted during blood transfusions. The paper claiming this was initially
rejected, since many different viruses had been proposed as the cause of serum
hepatitis. However, the research results were conﬁrmed by a group of Japanese
researchers [9] and others [10], and the results were immediately translated into
practical use. Since serum hepatitis was very common after blood transfusion
(about 18 %), blood was tested for the Australia antigen, and, if present, discarded.
The exclusion of such blood led to a decrease in the number of new cases of
hepatitis after blood transfusion, and within a few years this had become a routine
test. Despite this, there were still many cases of hepatitis after surgery, indicating
the possible presence of another virus.
In parallel work on the transmission of the serum antigens, the same group
initiated research to visualize the antigens using electron microscopy. A number of
different-size particles could be found in antigen-positive serum, representing
different stages of the virus development. These included particles about 20 nm in
diameter, which were aggregated by anti-Australia antigen antiserum. There were
also elongated-like particles of the same diameter. Subsequently Dane, Cameron
and Briggs identiﬁed a larger particle, about 42 nm in diameter, with an electron
dense core of about 27 nm [11]. This was called a ‘‘Dane particle’’ and it repre-
sents the whole virus particle. Both the 20 nm and 42 nm particles contain Aus-
tralia antigen on their surfaces; this is now termed ‘‘hepatitis B surface antigen’’
(HBsAg). The surface antigen can be removed from Dane particles by the action of
13.4
Hepatitis B

detergents to reveal the core, which produces its own antigen, hepatitis B core
antigen (HBcAg). All of these antigens can be found in the blood of hepatitis B
patients at different times during infection. HBsAg and HBcAg can be found in the
liver of infected patients (see Fig. 13.4).
Hepatitis B virus has been extensively studied and characterized [12–14]
(Fig. 13.5). The virus contains double-stranded circular DNA with a single-
stranded DNA region. The full-length strand is 3.2 kb and the single-stranded
region 1.7 kb in length. The virus contains a reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that
converts RNA to DNA, which is unusual for a DNA virus. This virus, and other
related viruses found in other animals such as the woodchuck, Peking duck and
ground squirrel, were called hepadnaviruses. They form a separate family in viral

following transfection with DNA (personal communication). A schematic of the
virus is presented in Fig. 13.5, which illustrates the partial double-stranded DNA.

13.5
Hepatitis B Therapy and Vaccine
Hepatitis B was until recently treated with interferon-alpha, with a sustained
response rate of approximately 30 %. A decrease in viral antigens (HBsAg or
HBeAg) is measured as an indicator of response after six months of interferon
therapy. Interferon therapy is expensive and can have serious side effects,
including ﬂu-like symptoms, nausea, depression, and fatigue. However, those
patients who do respond, appear to clear the virus and do not progress to liver
cancer [15].
A series of newer drugs are now available for the treatment of hepatitis B.
These include Lamivudine (20,30-dideoxy-30-thiacytidine), an analog of cytidine
that inhibits the reverse transcriptase of hepatitis B (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Lamivudine). It is phosphorylated to an active metabolite that competes for
incorporation into viral DNA and is also a potent inhibitor of HIV reverse trans-
criptase. Another drug, Hepsera (adefovir), is also a reverse transcriptase inhibitor
and has the advantage of Lamivudine, in that viral resistance takes longer to
develop. The FDA rejected Hepsera for treatment of HIV due to kidney toxicity at
the level indicated. Lower levels inhibit hepatitis B.
A summary of medications currently in use for treatment of hepatitis B is
presented in Table 13.1.
The hepatitis B vaccine was introduced in 1982, and is 99 % effective in
preventing infection. It is the ﬁrst vaccine to prevent a speciﬁc type of cancer, and
is one of the ﬁrst recombinant vaccines produced in yeast. The vaccine contains
the viral surface antigen cloned into yeast DNA and thus the vaccine does not
contain virus. Full immunity requires three rounds of vaccination, the ﬁrst two
administered a month apart, and the third six months later.
According to current estimates, there are some 800,000 to 1.4 million indi-
viduals with hepatitis B in the U.S. Hepatitis B is no longer considered a problem
in either the U.S. or western Europe (see map in Fig. 13.6), and this number pales
in contrast to the rest of the world, where there are an estimated 350 million
infected.
In contrast to most viral infections, the younger a person is when exposed to the
virus, the more his likelihood of being chronically infected. Approximately 90 %
of infected infants will develop chronic infection. The majority of new cases in the
U.S. (and the world) occur in children born with the infection. The risk of chronic
infection decreases as the child gets older. Approximately 25–50 % of children
infected between the ages of 1 and 5 will develop chronic hepatitis, and the risk
drops to 6–10 % if the child is over 5 years of age (http://www.who.int/
mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/). Worldwide, most people with chronic hepatitis
B were infected at birth or during early childhood. Hepatitis B is currently pre-
dominantly spread by sexual transmission. Other modes of spread include intra-
venous drug injection (sharing of needles), hemodialysis, and accidents among
health care workers. The virus is 50–100 times more infectious than HIV and can
be transmitted in semen and vaginal ﬂuids as well as blood. The virus is more
240

robust than HIV and can exist outside the body for as long as seven days. The
conditions for infection are similar to those for HIV, and the frequency increases
with the number of sexual partners, whether hetero- or homosexual.

Hepatitis B’s occurrence is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia,
including China (Fig. 13.6). Most people in these regions become infected with the
hepatitis B virus during childhood and between 5 and 10 % of the adult population
is infected. High rates of infections are also found in the Amazon and the southern
parts of Eastern and Central Europe. In the Middle East and the Indian subcon-
tinent, an estimated 2–5 % of the general population is chronically infected. Death
from liver disease occurs in 15–25 % of chronically infected individuals (http://
www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/).
The major consequences of HBV infection are loss of work and the psycho-
logical damage to the individual when he or she becomes aware that he or she is a
carrier; there is also the danger of transmitting the infection to sexual partners and
children. There has also been a stigma attached to those who are carriers of the
virus, similar to that found in cases of AIDS: loss of jobs, fear of loss of insurance
and fear of general discrimination.
For those who reach end-stage cirrhosis of the liver, transplant is the only
alternative. This is a very expensive procedure; it is estimated that a liver trans-
plant can cost as much as $577,000 in the U.S. (http://www.transplantliving.org/).
As described above for hepatitis A, there have been outbreaks of hepatitis B in
the military, often of unknown cause. One of the worst cases was an outbreak of
hepatitis following vaccination against yellow fever in a group of American ser-
vicemen in WW II; 50,000 cases of jaundice were observed and 62 deaths
reported. It is suspected that as many as 300,000 men were infected with hepatitis
B from the serum used to manufacture the yellow fever vaccine [3]. Hepatitis B
increased among military personal with the increase of drug abuse among soldiers
during and after the Vietnam War. Drug abuse has been a serious problem in the
army since the 1960s. Since hepatitis B is sexually transmitted, there was also a
high frequency among army personnel posted to the Far East, where hepatitis B is
endemic in the local population. Hepatitis B vaccine is now routinely given to all
military personnel.
The rates of chronic infection vary greatly in different parts of the world, with
about 10–25 % of long-term carriers developing liver cancer. About 1 million
people die of this disease annually. The mechanism of oncogenesis is unknown,
although the immune system probably constantly attacks hepatocytes (liver cells)
infected with the virus, causing extensive liver damage due to inﬂammation, as
well as the production of cytokines. In particular, CD8 cytotoxic T-cells attack
liver cells and the resulting cytokines cause damage to the liver. Viral DNA can be
found in the chromosomes of liver cells, but it is not known whether it activates a
speciﬁc oncogene. Since it takes a long time to develop cancer, there may be many
steps along the oncogenic pathway that ﬁnally lead to tumor formation.

The Discovery of Hepatitis C
Despite the discovery of hepatitis A and hepatitis B, a large population still had the
symptoms of hepatitis—that is, jaundice-like symptoms and elevated liver
enzymes—but with no trace of either of these two viruses. Such patients were
classiﬁed as non-A, non-B hepatitis infected, and the virus could not be identiﬁed
directly in the serum or liver of such individuals. A similar situation with similar
symptoms existed in chimpanzees. A group of scientists at the Chiron Corporation
between 1982 and 1988 devised a novel approach to determine whether patients
with non-A, non-B were infected with another virus [16–19]. The approach was
based on purely recombinant-molecular biology, without knowing whether or not a
virus existed, and certainly not knowing anything about the presumptive virus.
Total complementary DNA (cDNA) from the plasma of chimpanzees suspected of
having a high titer of virus was cloned into bacteriophage lambda, kg11, which
expresses cDNA-encoded polypeptides at a high level. The phage library was then
screened with serum from a non-A, non-B patient to detect possible viral epitopes
that might react with the patients’ antibodies. On screening millions of phage with
serum from the infected individual, one complementary clone (5–11) was detected.
The DNA from this clone did not hybridize to DNA isolated from either human or
chimpanzee uninfected tissue. Single-stranded RNA, of between 5,000–10,000
nucleotides isolated from the liver of infected chimpanzees, hybridized to this
clone. The RNA was further puriﬁed and sequenced, and contained sequences
coding for a long polypeptide typical of a virus. The non-A non-B patients were
infected with a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the ﬂavivirus family, and it
was found that the majority of hepatitis cases not identiﬁed as hepatitis A or B
were infected with what was to be called ‘‘hepatitis C’’.
13.7
Risk Factors for Hepatitis C; Testing
Hepatitis C may occur as an acute infection, or, more likely, develop into a chronic
infection. In most cases, the disease can go unrecognized for years since symptoms
develop slowly, with an elevation of liver enzymes, general fatigue and nausea,
and, in relatively rare cases, it may develop into hepatocellular carcinoma (liver
cancer). Hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
It is important to test for the virus if there is any suspicion of infection due to past
behavior, such as sharing of needles, intravenous injection of drugs, or even tat-
tooing. Figure 13.7 illustrates the risk factors for hepatitis C and Fig. 13.8 the
outcome of the infection. Note about 1 % will develop liver cancer.
According to the World Health Organization, there are 170 million people
infected worldwide with chronic hepatitis C, of whom approximately 350,000 die
each year. The CDC estimates that there are 3.5 million cases in the U.S., with
about 16,000 new cases per year and an equal number of deaths. It is the leading
cause of cirrhosis of the liver. (Note in Fig. 13.9 the extremely high numbers of
infected individuals in Egypt, Pakistan, Romania and Italy).
13.6
The Discovery of Hepatitis C
243

There is no strong evidence of sexual transmission of HCV, unlike the case of
hepatitis B, although it may be sexually transmitted along with HIV. It can be
transmitted from mother to child, but the rate of such transmission is low, about
4 %. Until 1992 blood was not screened for HCV, thus blood transfusions or blood
products infected many people accidentally before that date.
Initial testing for the presence of antibodies in the blood, indicates whether a
person had been exposed to the virus. A second test the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) measures the number of copies of viral RNA in the blood. During chronic
infection, this may be as high as 109 particles per ml of blood. A third test will look
for the strain of hepatitis C, since that will help to predict treatment response.
Types 1a and 1b are the most common in the U.S., and the most difﬁcult to treat
with interferon.
The prevalence of HCV infection among prison inmates is substantially higher
than that in the general U.S. population. Among prison inmates, about 12–35 % are
chronically infected, compared to 1–1.5 % in the overall U.S. population. Since
HCV infection is primarily associated with a history of intravenous drug use, the
CDC recommends that correctional facilities personnel ask inmates about their risk
factors for HCV infection during their entry medical evaluations. Inmates reporting
risk factors should be tested for HCV infection and those who test positive for it
should receive further medical evaluation to determine if they have chronic infec-
tion and/or liver disease (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/Settings/corrections.htm).

Hepatitis

While working as a volunteer in a medical facility in Indiana, most of those patients I
met having HCV had recently been released from prison. The proportion of pris-
oners with hepatitis B is also high, and prisoners now receive the vaccine.
Large numbers of veterans of the Vietnam War and, more recently, the Iraq and
Afghanistan conﬂicts, return with hepatitis C due to the increase in drug addiction
and tattooing among military personnel. Approximately 8–9 % of Veterans Affairs
medical center patients are positive for HCV antibodies, and 1 in 10 veterans
returning from Vietnam are HCV positive.
13.8
VIII Vaccine Development
Since this is an RNA virus, it undergoes mutation at a very high rate because of an
error-prone replicating enzyme. This has resulted in at least six genotypes of the
virus, the most common in the USA being antigen type 1a and 1b, and within each
genotype there develops a large number of quasi-species. The viral mutants that
accumulate avoid being neutralized by antibodies or T-cells, making it extremely
difﬁcult to develop a vaccine against the virus.
However, some new studies indicate that a vaccine is on the way. A phase 1 trial
has used recombinant human adenoviruses Ad6 and a chimpanzee Ad3 containing
the non-structural genes of HCV. These constructs elicited an HCV T-cell immune
response against the virus, including the induction of interferon-gamma and other
interleukins. This response has been sustained for one year with a boosting of the
vector viruses [20]. Similar studies are progressing in Korea with a DNA vaccine
containing many of the HCV structural genes. This is also an ongoing phase 1
clinical trial. Inovio’s SynCon DNA vaccine, INO-8000, carries the genes to
produce the antigens NS3/4A, NS4B, and NS5A of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, the
most difﬁcult-to-treat genotypes (Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). These are all non-
structural genes of the virus that code for proteases necessary for processing viral
polyprotein (the ﬁrst translational product of the virus) and the replicase. Since these
are not viral coat proteins, it is unclear whether neutralizing antibody will form.

13.9
Treatment
Until recently, the treatment for HCV was a regimen of interferon (usually of the
alpha type) plus ribavirin, an anti-viral, However, the response rate depends on the
antigenic type of the virus, the race of the patients, and the response to interferon
[21]. The sustained viral response rate, i.e., complete clearing of the virus among
Caucasians and Oriental patients with this regimen, is usually slightly under 50 %,
and among African Americans under 30 % [22]. These drugs are difﬁcult to tol-
erate, and treatment continues for 48 weeks. Interferon/ribavirin treatment is very
expensive, (about $1,000 per course of treatment) and interferon is not readily
available in many Third World countries. New drugs, based on inhibitors of viral
replication or speciﬁc viral enzymes, are now appearing on the market. Two new
therapeutic agents, telaprevir and boceprevir, have recently been licensed in some
countries, including the U.S. The Food and Drug Administration has approved
newer drugs including semaprevir and danoprevir, all protease inhibitors. Sof-
osbuvir, an inhibitor of the viral replicase, was tested in Europe, and inhibits the
virus without the addition of interferon. Conclusions from the clinical trial showed
that of the 40 patients who were in the randomized group and who received
sofosbuvir plus ribavirin there was a sustained viral response, measured as six
months without HCV RNA in the blood. However, these were not HCV type 1
patients. Further studies have shown that a combination of protease inhibitors and
replicase inhibitors can ‘‘cure’’ HCV without the use of interferon [23]. It is a

lack of information and reporting from this area

widely held opinion among hepatologists that interferon treatment eventually will
be discontinued.
One of the major difﬁculties in the development of anti-virals was the speciﬁcity
of the antiviral agent. Could one target the virus without hurting the host cell? With
the development of small molecules that can target speciﬁc viral enzymes, or RNA
virus replicase, this speciﬁc difﬁculty has been overcome. However, the new drugs
are very expensive; Gilead, the makers of sofosbuvir, plans to charge 1,000 per pill.
The medication has to be taken daily for 12 weeks, at a total cost of $84,000. It is true
that this regimen will cure the patient, and may cost less than liver transplant and
accompanying hospitalization, but it still seems excessive.
During my scientiﬁc career, I devoted a large part of my time to examining the
response to interferon/ribavirin treatment in HCV patients. I was a principal
investigator in a large clinical trial examining whether there were racial differences
in the level of response to interferon treatment. We also investigated the differ-
ential response at the genome level to interferon/ribavirin treatment between
responders and non-responders. The biochemical and genetic response to the
interferon treatment was analyzed using DNA-microarrays, a technique that
measures messenger RNA induction and, assumedly, proteins following drug
administration. Major differences could not be detected at the level of mRNA to
explain racial differences or lack of response. Shortly after the completion of this
study, a genetic polymorphism was discovered that might explain racial differ-
ences [24, 25]. This genetic polymorphism is within a few nucleotides of the IL28b
gene, encoding interferon-k3, a class of interferon not previously known. This
polymorphism enhanced the rate of response to treatment twofold, and was more
common among Caucasians that Africans, thus in part explaining the difference in
racial response rates.
No vaccine currently exists for HCV. The newer medications are very expen-
sive, and will be so for many years to come. The population diagnosed with HCV
will increase as more young people are tested and if the use of recreational drugs
and tattooing increases. This is a societal disease in which changes in behavior can
decrease the incidence of HCV. Most patients realize that their disease was a result
of risky behavior. Unlike the case of HIV/AIDS, there is little done by way of
education to prevent the spread of HCV.

Herpesvirus
Abstract
The herpes family of viruses is associated with a large number of infectious
diseases, including some types of cancer, such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, and Kaposi
sarcoma and with sexually transmitted diseases such as genital blisters. (HSV-2),
and chickenpox. The virus can exist in an active phase or latent phase, and can
manifest itself in different forms and pathological situations. Chickenpox can
reappear many years later as shingles, in particular when the immune system is
compromised. Epstein Barr-virus infection can lead to various cancers depending
on environmental and genetic factors, and in the lytic form as mononucleosis.
Burkitt’s lymphoma is conﬁned to areas of Africa with high malaria prevalence
and is characterized at the genetic level by a gene translocation. HSV-8 infection
results in Kaposi sarcoma and is found in individuals suffering from AIDS,
although now recognized as a cancer in non-AIDS populations in Africa. There
has been a dramatic increase in genital herpes during the last few years.
14.1
Burkitt’s Lymphoma
One way (and perhaps the only way) to immortalize immune cells is to infect them
with a herpes virus known as Epstein-Barr virus, so-called after two of the sci-
entists, Antony Epstein and Yvonne Barr, who isolated it from a tumor derived
from an African child with an unusual lymphoma, known as Burkitt’s lymphoma.
This is a tumor of the lymphatic system, particularly of B-cells, discovered by a
surgeon, Dennis Burkitt, while working in Equatorial Africa in 1958. The cancer
manifests itself in Africa mostly with deformation of the jawbones (Fig. 14.1). As
Dennis Burkitt tells it [1], in 1957 while working as a surgeon in Kampala,
Uganda, Dr. Hugh Trowell, who was in charge of the pediatrics ward at Mulago
Hospital, called him for a consultation on a child who had a massive swelling on

both sides of his upper and lower jaws. A biopsy suggested a type of granuloma, a
tumor mass containing macrophages, but no conclusions were reached. While
visiting another hospital a few weeks later, he noticed another child sitting outside
with similar features. He immediately took the mother and child back to Kampala.
On clinical examination, he detected a mass in the abdomen. How could a growth
(if that was what it was) in the jaw region be linked to a tumor in the abdomen? A
short time later, a number of children with this condition had been recognized, and
in most cases there were tumors in the abdomen or other organs as well as in the
jaw region. This did not seem to arise from an infection but was some unusual type
of cancer. Burkitt then examined the records of other children admitted to the
hospital over the last few years and found that many had similar symptoms. By
looking at histological slides from these children, Burkitt and his colleagues came
to the conclusion that this was some type of lymphoma, a cancer where cells of the
immune system, either B- or T-cells, divide faster than normal, or live longer than
normal, thus accumulating as a mass. Whether this was a novel phenomenon or not
was investigated by examining records kept at the nearby Mengo Mission Hos-
pital, the oldest hospital in East Africa. There were descriptions by Sir Albert Cook
(1870–1951), a missionary doctor at the turn of the nineteenth century, of the same
tumors of the jaw among children.

swelling which had been treated with antibiotics. The tumor was ulcerated and draining (courtesy

Herpesvirus

Sir Albert Cook, who had founded the Mengo Missions Hospital in 1897, con-
tributed greatly to the training of medical personnel in East Africa. He was out-
standing among medical missionaries for his efforts to train Africans to become
skilled medical workers. He and his wife opened a school for midwives at Mengo,
Uganda. Cook began training African medical assistants at Mulago during World
War I, and in the 1920s encouraged the opening of a medical college that initially
trained Africans to the level deﬁned by the colonial government as ‘‘Asian sub-
assistant surgeon.’’ The school grew to become a full-ﬂedged medical school in his
lifetime (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ruskin_Cook). Further investigation
by Burkitt indicated that the tumors only occurred in speciﬁc areas of Uganda, and
only in speciﬁc areas of Africa. These cancers were not found in North Africa above
the Sahara or South Africa. They appeared in a belt 10 degrees on either side of the
Equator, and along the South-Eastern east coast of the African continent (Fig. 14.2).

Burkitt’s Lymphoma
251

Dr. Burkitt and two colleagues embarked on a long trip of 10,000 miles across
Africa, visiting 60 hospitals in 10 countries, looking for other cases of what was by
now called ‘‘Burkitt’s lymphoma.’’ To summarize the results of this ‘‘safari,’’ the
tumor could not be detected in areas above 5,000 feet, thus it did not occur on high
ground. One thousand miles south of the Equator, the cut-off was 3,000 feet. Two
thousand miles south of the Equator the tumor was only found near the coast, and in
other areas it was found only in low-lying ground, near rivers and lakes. The tumors
did not occur anywhere where the temperature was below 15 C and only where the
annual rainfall was more than 15 in. per year. For the tumor to develop, the tem-
perature had to be above 60 F and rainfall more than 20 in. These data all suggested
an insect vector, possibly a mosquito. A similar tumor was found in other parts of the
world with similar climates, in particular in Papua, New Guinea.
Dr. Burkitt gave a lecture on his ﬁndings at Middlesex Hospital in London in
1961. A young experimental pathologist, Dr. Tony Epstein, was in the audience,
and asked after the lecture whether he could obtain some biopsied material. It was
in this material that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was discovered. The ﬁrst
hypothesis was that an insect vector-transmitted virus caused the tumor. However,
it was soon discovered that the virus is ubiquitous, and that it is found in almost all
humans, an observation discussed below. The EBV as it was now called, belonged
to the herpes viruses genus. Although it was later called herpes-4, the name EBV
has stuck. The geographical area where the lymphoma occurred was also an area
where there was a high frequency of malaria, so the question arose as to whether
there might be a link to this disease. The tumor appeared in areas of intense
malarial infection, and in areas where mosquitoes had been controlled, it was less
prevalent, so there was a correlation between malaria intensity and tumor occur-
rence. Among children who had sickle-cell anemia, which was protective against
malaria, the lymphoma occurred less frequently.
An intense outbreak of malaria is known to be immune-depressive over time.
Could immune depression activate EBV in such a way as to cause the lymphoma?
This hypothesis was supported by the fact that EBV existed in a ‘‘latent’’ state in
most individuals, and yet was the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis in
individuals not exposed to the virus early in life [2]. This was discovered by Werner
and Gertrude Henle of Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia when a lab technician
working in their lab with Epstein-Barr virus became sick with mononucleosis.
Infectious mononucleosis results in an abnormal increase in lymphoid cells. The
Henles also showed that B-lymphocytes, when infected with EBV, became
immortal in culture. This was an important observation and is used to this day to
create human cell lines.
14.2
Epstein–Barr Virus and c-myc Translocation
There is another twist to the EBV and Burkitt’s lymphoma story. Burkitt’s lym-
phomas contain chromosomal translocations that result in c-myc up regulation. The
myc gene is one of the best characterized oncogenes—that is, genes causing cancer
252
14
Herpesvirus

in humans. This gene product is a regulatory protein that controls a large number of
transcription factors and thus enhances cell replication. The mutant form is found in
many cancers, including cervical, breast, and colon cancer. The most common
chromosomal translocation, t(8;14), places a portion of the c-myc oncogene adjacent
to an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (a gene important in making antibodies, and
many other functions in the cell). Less common translocations involve the c-myc
oncogene and the kappa or lambda immunoglobulin light chain genes t(2;8) and
t(8;22), respectively. These translocations result in high constitutive expression of c-
myc. Abnormal expression of c-myc in EBV-immortalized B-cell lines results in
highly transformed cells that form tumors when injected into immune-deﬁcient
mice. Transgenic mice that express a mutated human c-myc that is derived from a
Burkitt’s lymphoma and is fused to the Igk locus, develop tumors that have histo-
logic and phenotypic features of Burkitt’s lymphomas.
EBV-associated endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma is thought to develop in steps.
First, EBV infection may expand the pool of differentiating and proliferating B-
cells; second, chronic high-level malaria infection may cause T-cell suppression
and B-cell proliferation. Third, enhanced proliferation of differentiating B-cells
may favor the chance occurrence of a reciprocal c-myc (t[8;14] or t[8;22]) trans-
location, placing c-myc partially under the control of immunoglobulin-related
transcriptional enhancers, with development of a monoclonal (derived from a
single cell) tumor [3] (Fig. 14.3). Thus, Burkitt’s lymphoma is an example of an
‘‘environmental’’ cancer that results from interaction of temperature, insects
(mosquito), virus, and perhaps genetic propensity for a gene translocation.
Burkitt’s lymphoma is no longer thought of as an ‘‘African disease,’’ since there
have been cases identiﬁed in the U.S. and in Brazil. The rate of Burkitt’s in the U.S. is
about 0.4 per 100,000—a very rare cancer. Recent evidence supports the concept
that not only is the myc gene mutated in Burkitt’s lymphoma, but that many other
genes, important in B-cell biology and cell cycle regulation, are mutated.
14.3
Naso-Pharyngial Carcinoma and Other Tumors
Another cancer associated with EBV is naso-pharyngial carcinoma, which occurs
predominantly in Southern China. The rate is about 20 cases per 100,000 popu-
lation, although it may occur in other countries at a much lower rate. In the U.S.,
Chinese-Americans are the main victims. It has been associated with diet, and
perhaps high salt intake, and vitamin C deﬁciency at a young age also may be a
contributing factor. Finally, a study of HLA haplotypes, genes involved in the
rejection process of the immune system, revealed a genetically distinct subpopu-
lation in southern China, with an increased frequency of haplotype A-2/B-Sin-2,
which may account for the higher disease incidence in the area. EBV has been
shown more recently to be associated also with B-cell lymphomas such as
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and other lympho-proliferative disorders. EBV-initiated
tumors also occur in AIDS patients during immunosuppression. Burkitt’s lym-
phoma responds to treatment with many chemotherapeutic agents.

Epstein-Barr Virus and c-myc Translocation
253

14.4
Epstein–Barr Virus and Mononucleosis
It turns out that EBV, as it is now called, is one of the most common viruses in
man and almost everyone in the world carries it. Most human cells in culture are
also EBV-positive. Infants become susceptible to it as soon as maternal antibodies
disappear. When infection with EBV occurs among adolescents or young adults
who have not been exposed to the virus, mononucleosis occurs about 50 % of the
time. The virus is carried in saliva of infected individuals, and in some cases in
people who have no symptoms but are EBV-positive. The symptoms of mono-
nucleosis are swollen lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, and fever. EBV
remains dormant after the illness in a few cells for the rest of that person’s life; as
such, it is in the latent stage. There is no treatment for mononucleosis.
Epstein-Barr virus might also be associated with multiple sclerosis. There is
circumstantial or correlative evidence that MS occurs 2–3 times more following
mononucleosis than in the rest of the EBV-positive population, and that MS is very
rare in EB-negative individuals, although as pointed out, such individuals must be
very rare. Additional evidence supporting a role for EBV in MS pathogenesis
includes the observations of elevated antibodies to EBV antigens (especially EBV
nuclear antigen-1) prior to the onset of MS [4].

Herpesvirus

14.5
The E–B Virus
Epstein-Barr virus belongs to the gammaherpes virus family. It is a large virus and
may code for as many as 85 genes. The genome consists of linear double-stranded
DNA (Fig. 14.4).
The virus has both a lytic cycle in which replication takes place in the nucleus
of the host cell, and a latent stage where it exists as an episome, an independent
genetic entity, and replicates with host DNA. Like most herpes viruses, the tran-
scription of the viral message is temporal, with different areas of the genome being
transcribed at different times during infection. There are early genes, intermediate
early genes and late genes expression. Transcription of immediate early genes
promotes translation of early genes and protects the virus against innate host
immunity, including interferon. Transcription of early viral mRNA is by host
polymerase II, encoding proteins involved in replication of the viral DNA. DNA
replication is by what is called the ‘‘circular model,’’ similar to phage DNA
replication, and transcription of late messages also uses host enzymes. The virus is
assembled in the nucleus and buds through the inner layers of the nuclear mem-
brane, which has been modiﬁed by the insertion of herpes glycoproteins, and ﬁnal
release at the plasma membrane. This virus is one of the largest human viruses and
it contains genetic material that mimics many host genes that act as ‘‘decoys’’ and
inhibit the immune system.

Kaposi’s Sarcoma
The virus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma is similar in structure and mode of rep-
lication to that described above for EBV. It is now known as human herpesvirus-8
(HHV8).
In 1872, Moritz Kaposi (born October 23, 1837, in Kaposvár, Hungary, died
March 6, 1902, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary), a Hungarian dermatologist and
professor at Vienna University, described lesions that occurred on the feet or hands
of six elderly men. These were brown-red or blue-red nodules, cancerous, and
became known as Kaposi’s sarcoma (note that the name of the tumor is derived
from the town in which Kaposi was born). He was born Moritz Cohen but changed
his name either to avoid anti-Semitism, or because there were too many Cohens on
the faculty of Medicine in Vienna. This was a rare cancer usually found in elderly
people of Mediterranean descent, until it appeared among young homosexual men
at the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. It is now one of the most common cancers
of our time, the fourth most common cause of cancer by an infectious agent. It was
the observation of a higher-than-usual incidence of Kaposi’s sarcoma that led to
the ﬁrst diagnosis of an immunodeﬁciency among young homosexual men in 1982.
This was an unusual occurrence. Since it was present among gay men who were
HIV-positive but not among others who had blood-borne diseases, such as
hemophiliacs, it was suspected that there must be an infectious agent involved
(Fig. 14.5).
The virus was ﬁrst recognized by comparing the DNA from individuals who
had KS and those who did not, and a DNA resembling a gamma herpes virus was
recognized in 1994. As stated above, this was called HHV-8. A series of bio-
chemical tests, comparing the presence of antibodies to the virus, viral DNA, and
the viruses’ presence in tumor cells, left no doubt that this was the causative agent.
The major antigen appears to be a protein related to viral latency. The frequency is
high among the HIV-positive homosexual population: 25–35 %. It is also high
among children in sub-Saharan Africa, which may result from the high frequency
of infection among pregnant women. In one study, approximately 40 % of preg-
nant women in Zambia had anti-latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA)
antibodies, including all the mothers of children with KS [5]. A role for sexual
transmission has been convincingly demonstrated in a longitudinal study of men in
San Francisco followed over a 10-year period. Among exclusively heterosexual
men, no Kaposi’s sarcoma sero-positivity was detected; however, among homo-
sexual or bisexual men, the incidence of sero-conversion was linearly related to the
number of male sexual-intercourse contacts. Men who had had more than 250
sexual partners in the preceding 2 years had a sero-positivity rate of 65 % [5]
(Fig. 14.5).
The basis of the oncogenic affect of KS is still unknown. Preliminary data
indicates an affect, possibly by a viral gene on T-cell cycle regulation.

Herpes Simplex
I have discussed the ‘‘newer’’ herpes viruses ﬁrst, since they are rather unique, and
have a fascinating history. Human herpes viruses are divided into three families.
‘‘Alpha’’ herpes viruses include herpes simplex 1, and 2, and varicella-zoster
(chicken pox-shingles); ‘‘beta’’ herpes viruses include herpes 6 and 7; and
‘‘gamma’’ herpes viruses are those discussed above (Epstein-Barr virus and Ka-
posi’s sarcoma, HHV8).
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) and 2 (HSV2) are very common in the human
population and we know that HSV-1 and 2 have been around in the human pop-
ulation for a long time. The symptoms we associate with herpes simplex 1—cold
sores on the lips or in the mouth—were described as far back as Hippocrates
(460–377 BC) in Greece. He used the term ‘‘herpes,’’ which in Greek means
‘‘creeping’’ to describe a number of different conditions, including what we
believe today is oral herpes caused by HSV1. It is said that the emperor of Rome,

Kaposi’s Sarcoma
257

Tiberius (42 BC–37 AD), banned kissing at one time because of an epidemic of
herpes. The ﬁrst written description of what we now call herpes appears in the
work of Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BC–50 AD) who in 30 AD published six
volumes of a work, De Medicina, in which there is a vague description of the
infection. The term herpes labialis, to describe oral herpes, was coined by the
Roman physician, Herodotus, in about 100 AD. Galen (130–201 AD) described
the fact that the sores always occurred at the same site, which we now recognize
would be the site of the original infection (this history adapted from http://www.
livingsphere.com/) (Fig. 14.6).
Herpes is possibly mentioned in Shakespeare’s ‘‘Romeo and Juliet,’’ when he
wrote that there are blisters ‘‘o’er ladies’ lips.’’ In the eighteenth century it was so
common among prostitutes that it was called ‘‘a vocational disease of women.’’
Today HSV-2 is the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the U.S. The
major mode of HSV-2 transmission is by sexual intercourse or oral sex. The virus
can also be transmitted by touching lesions and then touching other locations in the
body, in particular the eyes. The use of condoms during sex can decrease the
frequency and chances of getting herpes. HSV-2 is a lifelong and incurable
infection that can cause recurrent and painful genital sores and can make those
infected with the virus two to three times more likely to acquire HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS. It results in painful blisters on the penis and genital areas and is ten
times more common than HSV-1. At least 50 million persons in the United States
have a genital HSV infection, and an estimated 766,000 new cases of symptom-
atic, ﬁrst-episode genital HSV-2 infections occur each year. About one in six
people in the U.S. between the ages of 14 and 49 have genital herpes, more women
than men, since it is spread more easily by men than by women. In many cases it is
asymptomatic, but when symptoms do occur, they typically appear as one or more
blisters on or around the genitals, rectum or mouth. The blisters break and leave
painful sores that may take 2–4 weeks to heal. Outbreaks of the disease occur
sporadically, more at the beginning of the infection and less as time goes on. The
virus stays in the body indeﬁnitely, and between outbreaks it is said to be in a
latent state. It can be activated by stress and hormonal changes.

Herpesvirus

Pregnant women should be very careful, since the virus can be transmitted to
the unborn baby, resulting in death of the embryo, or transmission to the child.
Eighty percent of babies born with herpes die at birth or shortly thereafter, and
survivors are often brain-damaged. There has been a large increase in HSV-2
infections in the last few years, as shown in Fig. 14.7.
There is no cure for HSV-2. Symptoms can be alleviated with anti-viral drugs
such as acyclovir. This compound can be used to treat both HSV-1 and HSV-2
infections as well as shingles, which results from another herpes virus (varicella-
zoster or chicken pox). It alleviates pain and lengthens the time between outbreaks.
A National Institute of Health-supported clinical trial showed that once-daily
suppressive therapy using valacyclovir signiﬁcantly reduces the risk of transmit-
ting genital herpes to an uninfected partner. Valacyclovir is a pro-drug, that is, it
converts to acyclovir in the body and is more efﬁcient than acyclovir adminis-
tration. This was the ﬁrst time an antiviral medication had been shown to reduce
the risk of transmission of a sexually transmitted disease. Topical microbicides,
preparations containing microbe-killing compounds, are also in various stages of
development and testing. These include gels, creams, or lotions that a woman can
insert into her vagina prior to sexual intercourse.
14.8
Worldwide Prevalence of HSV-2
The estimated total number of people around the world aged 15–49 who were
living with HSV-2 in 2003 was 536 million (Table 14.1). More women than men
were infected, with an estimated 315 million infected women compared to 221
million infected men. The number infected increased with age, most markedly in
the younger people, until it peaked in the 35–39 age group, after which it declined
slightly. The number infected per age group is a combination of the size of the
population in the group multiplied by the prevalence of infection and, as the pool
of susceptible individuals is used up with increasing age, the rate of increase in

prevalence slows. In the model, prevalence itself does not decline with age, but
because there were fewer older people than younger people in total, the actual
number with current infections slightly decreased. This is shown in Table 14.1.
The regional incidence of HSV-2 is shown in Tables 14.2 and 14.3, one for
females and the other for males.
14.9
Chicken Pox: Varicella–Zoster
Before the advent of a chicken pox vaccine, about 4,000,000 people would get
chicken pox each year in the U.S.; about 10,600 of them would be hospitalized and
100–150 would die. Chicken pox is a very contagious disease causing a blister-like
rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chicken pox can be serious, especially in babies,
and in adults with weakened immune systems. The virus spreads by coughing or
sneezing, or by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chicken
pox blisters. (An example of the rash is shown in Fig. 14.8). The classic symptoms
of chicken pox are a rash that turns into itchy, ﬂuid-ﬁlled blisters that eventually
form scabs. The rash may ﬁrst show up on the face, chest, and back, then spread to
the rest of the body, including inside the mouth, eyelids, and genital area. It usually
takes about 1 week for all the blisters to become scabs. Giovanni Fillipo Ingrassia
(1510–1580) was the ﬁrst to describe chicken pox as a separate disease in the
1500s in Italy. Ingrassia was a Sicilian physician and anatomist, and professor at
the University of Naples, and was the ﬁrst to describe various infections. In the
1600s, an English physician named Richard Morton (1637–1698) gave the name
chicken pox to what he thought was a milder form of smallpox. It is believed that
in the 1700s, William Heberden (1710–1801) (another English physician), was the
ﬁrst physician to prove that chicken pox was actually different from smallpox. He
wrote extensively on this disease in 1776, in Medical Transactions of the Royal
Society (Fig. 14.8).

Herpesvirus

Herpes zoster (shingles) has been recognized since ancient times and was
described in the early medical literature. Clinical observations of the relationship
between varicella and herpes zoster were made in 1888 by Von Bokay, when
susceptible children acquired varicella (chicken pox) after contact with shingles.
Varicella virus (VZV) was isolated from the vesicular ﬂuid of both chicken pox
and zoster lesions in cell culture by Thomas Huckle Weller in 1954.
Subsequent laboratory studies of the virus led to the development of a live
attenuated varicella vaccine, the Oka strain, in Japan in 1974, by Michiaki
Takahashi [7]. The original virus was isolated from a three-year-old, otherwise
healthy Japanese boy with varicella. To prepare the seed lot, the virus was pas-
saged 11 times at 34 C in human embryonic ﬁbroblasts, 12 times at 37 C in
guinea pig ﬁbroblasts, and 5 times in human diploid ﬁbroblasts (WI-38 and MRC-
5 cells) at 37 C [7]. Additional passages were carried out by the manufacturers to
prepare the vaccine to be marketed. Because VZV is so strongly cell-associated,
the ﬁnal product had to be sonicated and clariﬁed by centrifugation to produce live
cell-free virus. The vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in healthy and

263

immunocompromised children, and in healthy adults; a booster injection of the
vaccine is required 5 years later.
The vaccine has been licensed in the U.S. since 1995. When the virus was ﬁrst
introduced in Japan, there was controversy surrounding its use. It was tested on
uninfected children and immunocompromised children, since chicken pox by itself
was lethal in many cases in children suffering from leukemia or other cancers. In
Japan, the strategy used was ﬁrst to vaccinate healthy children and then to grad-
ually try to immunize safely immunocompromised children, progressing from the
mildly to the severely immunocompromised. This possibly protective approach
was taken because at that time, many young children were surviving cancer, only
to die of varicella. Similar studies were carried out in the U.S. over a long period,
to ascertain that immunocompromised individuals were not in danger from the
vaccine. This vaccine is considered very safe [8].
The VZV pathogen may lie dormant in the spinal nerve roots (dorsal root
ganglia) through a chicken pox-infected individual’s life, only manifesting its
presence through outbreaks as shingles (herpes zoster). Many factors are respon-
sible for initiating a spontaneous outbreak, such as age, stress, and immunocom-
promised conditions caused by certain cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma,
and human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV). Individuals who receive immunosup-
pressive drugs, such as steroids and drugs given after organ transplantation, often
break out with shingles. It is a painful infection, which may include a blistering
rash and severe burning, tingling, or extreme sensitivity to the skin and may last
about a month. Blisters on the face can cause problems with vision and hearing,
while the spread of the disease to the body’s internal organs can cause serious
damage, including encephalitis (inﬂammation of the brain). Approximately one in
three Americans develops shingles. Although the person with shingles can transmit
the virus to others, it is in the form of chicken pox, and not shingles and it is less
infectious that an initial outbreak of chicken pox. A vaccine for shingles is
available in the U.S. for persons over the age of 60. The vaccine was approved by
the FDA in 2006 and appears to be 50 % effective and safe. The shingles vaccine
contains a live attenuated virus and is marketed by Merck as Zostvax. The zoster
vaccine is, essentially, a larger-than-normal dose of the chicken pox vaccine
(Varivax, Varilrix).
14.10 Viral Latency
One of the unusual characteristics of the herpes virus family is their ability to ‘‘lie
low’’ for long periods of time. The virus migrates from its original site in epithelial
cells along nerve axons to nerve cells and remains there for long periods. During
that period, speciﬁc genes associated with latency may be active, suppressing viral
replication. A variety of factors, such as stress, hormonal changes, or immuno-
suppression associated with cancer treatment, all can trigger the virus. In the case
of HSV-1 and HSV-2 there can be blisters at the original site of infection, but in
264
14
Herpesvirus

the case of varicella-zoster, shingles may erupt in a section of the body where the
virus is in hiding (latent). The herpes viruses remain partially or completely hidden
from the immune system during latency, since they encode a variety of gene
products—some of which are homologous to those of the host—that have the
potential to evade the host immune responses. Co-evolution over millennia has
resulted in an interaction between host and pathogen leading to the successful
establishment of a lifelong latent infection with typically minimal impact upon the
host, and subsequent maintenance and control of latently infected cells by the host
immune system. Latency works to the beneﬁt of the virus, since it allows for
reappearance and spread of virus throughout the life of the host. It is a form of
evolutionary adaptation.

HIV and AIDS
Abstract
The ﬁrst cases of AIDS were reported in 1981 with the occurrence of
Pneumocystis carinii in a cohort of young homosexual men in the U.S. This
‘‘new’’ disease affected the immune system, destroying CD4 T-cells. The disease
spread rapidly, initially among ‘‘gay’’ men, but later into the heterosexual
community. At the same time, a ‘‘novel’’ cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS),
appeared in infected individuals; it was later found to be associated with a herpes
virus. By 1982 it was obvious that AIDS was associated with an infectious agent,
which was sexually transmitted or spread by intravenous drug use. The blood
supply was contaminated since hemophiliacs became infected with the virus.
Within 3 years of the initial outbreak, a virus was isolated. Initially called
HTLV-3 by Robert Gallo (NIH), it was shown to be the same virus as LAV that
was isolated by Montagnier at the Pasteur Institute a few months earlier. Because
of a controversy as to who had isolated the virus ﬁrst, an international committee
decided to name the virus human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV). Within a short
time, HIV had spread all over the world, and by 1995 the number of infected
people reached 30–40 million, at the peak of the epidemic. The virus actually
crossed into the human population in the 1950s or earlier, and had crossed
species from a chimpanzee. The disease began in Central Africa and the Congo
and spread via Haiti to the U.S. and other countries. Today there is a regimen of
drugs that controls the progression of the disease, but does not cure the patient,
and attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. There have been
many scandals related to tainted blood, discrimination against HIV-positive
individuals, and dubious government policies.

15.1
The Beginnings of a Pandemic
In 1981 the world was surprised to learn about the arrival of a completely new
disease that has by now affected tens of millions of people worldwide. This disease
can be called the ‘‘plague’’ of the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries. It is known
as AIDS—Acquired Immune Deﬁciency Syndrome—because the virus that causes
the disease (HIV-1, human immunodeﬁciency virus-1) predominantly attacks the
CD4 helper cells of the immune system and thus inhibits the immune system from
functioning normally.
In 1981 a number of young men were treated at UCLA Hospital with a diag-
nosis of cytomegalovirus infection (normally not pathogenic in healthy individu-
als) including symptoms of diarrhea, and oral and anal thrush, indicating a collapse
of the immune system. By May 1981 the number of such patients at UCLA
Hospital had increased to ﬁve and the ﬁrst died in March 1981. All were young
homosexual men, and all suffered from pneumonia brought on by a fungus,
Pneumocystis carinii (until 1988 classiﬁed as a protozoa) that is a normal com-
ponent of the ﬂora of the human lung, and only becomes pathogenic under con-
ditions of suppressed immunity (he fungus is now known as Pneumocystis
jirovecii). All the infected individuals clustered in one speciﬁc area of the coun-
try—Los Angeles—and all were young gay men. This type of pneumonia is
usually cured with a single treatment of antibiotics, but in these cases it persisted
even after continuous treatment. To quote from the Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report of June 5, 1981: ‘‘In the period October 1980–May 1981, 5 young
men, all active homosexuals, were treated for biopsy-conﬁrmed P. carinii pneu-
monia at three different hospitals in Los Angeles, California. Two of the patients
died. All ﬁve patients had laboratory-conﬁrmed previous or current cytomegalo-
virus (CMV) infection and candida mucosal infection.’’
A year before, a number of cases of an unusual form of immune deﬁciency was
observed in New York City. No one initially recognized the relationship to similar
events in California. In March 1980, a young gay man (‘‘N’’) had an illness that
left his doctors perplexed; he had weight loss, spiking fevers and severe fatigue.
An infectious agent was suspected when one of his friends was diagnosed with
similar symptoms. N collapsed, and a brain scan showed cerebral lesions con-
taining Toxoplasma gondii, which is normally benign. He died in January 1981.
Beginning in 1980, and even earlier, a series of severe cases of Pneumocystis
carnii was noted in New York City, and this led to an increase in the demand for a
particular drug, pentamidine, used to treat antibiotic-resistant cases of Pneumo-
cystis. In April 1981, Sandra Ford at the Centers for Disease Control brought the
attention of her supervisor to the increase in orders for this drug [1].
At the same time, a rare type of cancer, Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) usually found
only in elderly patients of Mediterranean ancestry, was reported in other clusters of
gay men [2]. Initially it was suggested that there was some relationship to cyto-
megalovirus, a herpes virus associated with the defect in the immune system. The
CDC formed a task force to look into the occurrence of these and other
268
15
HIV and AIDS

opportunistic infections, as diseases such as PCP and KS became known. It was
initially thought that this was solely a disease of the ‘‘gay’’ community, and was
termed as such: GRID, gay-related immunodeﬁciency [3]. Its mode of spread and
its cause were unknown. By late 1981, the disease was also identiﬁed in drug
addicts, likely spread through needle-sharing, but it was still considered pre-
dominantly a disease of the gay population. By the end of 1981 there had been a
cumulative total of 270 reported cases, of whom 121 had died [4]. By July of 1982,
it was clear that the disease was caused by an infectious agent, since it occurred
among a group of individuals in various states who may have had contact with
individuals in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, and there seemed to be
no doubt that the disease was sexually transmitted.
During 1982, a number of hemophiliacs were reported to have the symptoms of
what was now called AIDS, resulting in the fear (warranted at the time) that the
blood supply might be contaminated with this infectious agent. Hemophilia is a
genetic disease in which factors that control blood clotting are missing. This
requires the hemophiliac to have blood transfusions or injections of the missing
factor after an injury of any type to stop the bleeding. The factors used by
hemophiliacs (factors VIII or IX) were isolated from pools of blood that were
bought commercially. These hemophiliacs were not ‘‘gay,’’ and in many cases
were children. Thus, not only was the disease sexually transmitted, but the
infectious agent was also in the blood supply [5]. By the end of 1983, 21 hemo-
philiac AIDS patients had been identiﬁed in the U.S. and 8 in Europe. There was
no doubt that the blood supply was contaminated, a fact not easily accepted by the
medical profession nor by suppliers of blood. In 1980 a medical team at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, had administered six units of whole blood, a unit
of packed red cells, and four units of fresh frozen plasma to a 53-year-old man
during open-heart surgery. Twenty-nine months later the patient had AIDS. He
was neither homosexual nor a drug addict, nor did he belong to any group sus-
pected of having AIDS. In 1983, the CDC reported 39 cases where the only factor
related to AIDS was a blood transfusion.
Another group identiﬁed as carrying the disease were immigrants from Haiti,
leading to discrimination against Haitians in the U.S. for a time [6, 7]; none of the
Haitians was homosexual. Recent studies have indicated that the virus spread from
Africa to Haiti, and was probably introduced into the U.S. from Haiti many years
before the ﬁrst cases were identiﬁed in either country. Later, Haiti would be
recognized as one of the countries with the highest percentage of AIDS in the
population, running second only to sub-Saharan Africa [1].
The disease is usually initiated by a short period of ﬂu-like illness, after which
there may be a period of normal health for months or years. Fever, diarrhea, thrush
on the tongue, and the beginning of what has been called ‘‘opportunistic infec-
tions’’ begin anywhere from a few weeks after the initial infection (the one
accompanied by ﬂu-like symptoms) to anywhere up to 10 years. Opportunistic
infections result from what might be termed ‘‘normal ﬂora’’ that our immune
system keeps in check. As we will discuss later, HIV destroys CD4 helper T-cells,
thus impairing antibody production and the function of CD8 killer cells. When the
15.1
The Beginnings of a Pandemic
269

CD4 cells fall below 200/ll of blood, opportunistic infections occur and death
usually results.
The ﬁrst U.S. Congressional hearing on AIDS was in April of 1982, at which
time the CDC announced that tens of thousands might be affected by the disease.
Congress allocated some funds ($2 million) to explore the causes of the illness—
not very much compared to large sums for other illnesses, such as Legionnaire’s
disease. President Reagan did not mention the word ‘‘AIDS’’ until 1987.
There was much speculation as to the origins of the infectious agent, whether it
was a ‘‘new’’ disease of man, whether it was a disease that had jumped species, or
an old disease that had been reactivated. As usually happens in the panic sur-
rounding a plague, attempts were made in the media, as well as by demagogues, to
blame the disease on ‘‘foreign’’ sources, such as Haiti, or in Africa on Europeans or
‘‘colonialists.’’ There were also others with conspiracy theories blaming the CIA,
‘‘mad’’ scientists, and the deliberate contamination of the blood supply. By the end
of 1982 it was obvious that this was an infectious disease, not limited to the U.S.
(cases were also reported in France and the U.K.), and not conﬁned to gay men. It
occurred in people receiving blood transfusions, and in one case vertical trans-
mission (mother to child). Later, it was shown that large numbers of children were
HIV-positive from infected mothers, particularly in African countries.
By 1983 cases of AIDS-like diseases were identiﬁed in Zaire, the Congo,
Belgium, Canada, Brazil and many European countries. The disease in most of
these cases was transmitted not homosexually, but heterosexually. In 1985 another
AIDS-like disease was diagnosed (not as severe as AIDS in Europe and the
Americas) in a West African prostitute. It was called HIV-2 and was caused by a
different infectious agent. HIV-2 has probably been around for some time in the
human population but was not diagnosed as a separate illness because of general
poor health due to malnutrition, in parts of Africa, and the disease was recognized
in 1981 among refugees seeking medical care in Portugal and France. The virus
was isolated in 1985 and shown to be different from HIV-1. According to the
director of the Public Health services in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa, this is an
old disease with a new name. For centuries people in the area died of diarrhea and
tuberculosis. The disease is spread heterosexually and by blood transfusions.
Infection evolves more slowly than with HIV-1, with longer survival and greater
incidence of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. There is no cross-protection by both
viruses, and simultaneous infection with both viruses can occur. According to a
1985 survey of prostitutes in Dakar, most were infected with HIV-2. The ﬁrst
conﬁrmed case of HIV-2 in the U.S. was reported in 1987 in a West African
woman with symptoms similar to AIDS. By 2003 the number of cases of HIV-2 in
the U.S. had reached 94, the majority of them among people of African origin and
66 of them born in West Africa. This virus was probably derived from a related
virus, SIVsm (simian immunodeﬁciency virus) infecting sooty mangabeys (a type
of primate) in the early part of the twentieth century. This virus never reaches the
viral load detected in HIV1 and does not attack the immune system to the same
extent as HIV [8].

15.2
Isolation of the Virus
The story of the discovery and identiﬁcation of the causative agent of AIDS is one
of rivalry between two groups of scientists, each claiming priority and a certain
amount of misinformation and arrogance on the part of both groups. During the
early stages of the epidemic, scientists in the U.S. and Europe endeavored to
isolate the infectious agent. It was not known whether this was a viral, bacterial, or
fungal infection, or even due to an environmental contaminant—or due to a
speciﬁc lifestyle, as claimed by some. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer
Institute in Washington D.C. had previously identiﬁed a human tumor virus
causing symptoms of leukemia. He called this virus HTLV-1, since it was asso-
ciated with human T-cell leukemia. This was followed by the isolation of HTLV-2,
not directly associated with any human disease. These isolates were from blood
lymphocytes cultured in a novel interleukin, IL-2 (cell producing growth factor)
and could be characterized using a newly developed assay by the Gallo lab for the
presence of the reverse transcriptase enzyme, unique to retroviruses and the
hepatitis B virus. These observations were of immense importance in medical
virology. Gallo and his colleagues were considered the world experts on retrovi-
ruses, and so Gallo threw himself and his group into the effort to ﬁnd the causative
agent of AIDS. Assuming it was related to HTLV.
By September of 1982, Jacques Leibowitch, a physician working in Paris, had
been convinced that the virus causing AIDS was a retrovirus that speciﬁcally
infected CD4 T-cells and was transmitted by blood. He suggested that it might be
similar to HTLV-1, or at least a retrovirus. He discussed this with Gallo and with
the Pasteur Institute group, headed by Luc Montagnier and François Barr-Sinnousi.
Rather than looking for the virus in blood, the Pasteur group decided to look for
the virus in the lymph node removed from the neck of a 33-year-old patient (RUB)
who had early symptoms of immunodeﬁciency. Cells were grown in culture, in the
presence of anti-interferon antibodies, in order to neutralize any interferon that
might inhibit viral growth. After 15 days in culture, reverse transcriptase was
detected and associated with viral particles, having the same density as a retro-
virus. The virus grew slowly, and the culture seemed to die out, until fresh blood
was added to it; the fresh blood stimulated growth of the virus. It was initially
thought to be like HTLV-1, but this new virus killed T-cells in culture, whereas
HTLV-1 promoted T-cell growth. The virus appeared to be a retrovirus, but not
identical to HTLV-1, as initially claimed by the Gallo group and was later called
‘‘lymph-adenopathy-associated virus’’ (LAV) by the Pasteur Institute group. These
results indicated to the French group that this virus was different from HTLV.
Montagnier informed Gallo of his discovery, and Gallo sent antibodies capable of
recognizing HTLV-1, but they did not react with the isolated virus. Gallo found it
difﬁcult to accept the results, since he was convinced that the ‘‘new’’ virus must be
related to HTLV [1]. A paper announcing the isolation of a new virus appeared in
Science on May 20, 1983, in the same issue that Gallo and Max Essex of Harvard
separately announced that HTLV-1 was implicated in AIDS. In an editorial in the
15.2
Isolation of the Virus
271

‘‘News and Views’’ section on this subject, the paper by Montagnier’s group is
discussed brieﬂy after a review of ﬁve papers reporting that HTLV-1 is associated
with AIDS. It describes the French virus as being slightly different from HTLV-1
[9]. In the paper itself, the French authors claimed that the new virus contained
proteins not usually found in HTLV-1, and the electron micrograph of the virus
was not identical to HTLV-1. However, at this stage no one was willing to claim
that he or she had identiﬁed the causative agent of AIDS.
The group at the Pasteur Institute continued to isolate viruses from multiple
cases of AIDS from patients of various ethnic and social classes, and in all cases
the virus was the same as their primary isolate, LAV—not even related to the
HTLV family. Despite presentations at Cold Spring Harbor, Gallo and the NCI
establishment rejected the idea that LAV could be the causative agent of AIDS,
and stuck with HTLV-1 as the causative agent, later calling it HTLV-3.
In early 1984 the Pasteur group began to compare the LAV with HTLV-1 and
conﬁrmed the differences previously noted, as well as other differences. In
December 1983, a paper appeared showing an electron micrograph of a virus
isolated from a young homosexual male with AIDS. This virus also differed in
many respects from HTLV-1, and these antibodies could not be detected in AIDS
patients [10, 11]. As it turned out, this newly discovered virus was the one that
would ﬁnally be identiﬁed with AIDS, and it predated the discovery of the
‘‘correct’’ virus by Gallo and his group.
On April 24, 1984, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services announced at a press conference that Robert Gallo and his colleagues had
isolated a new virus, HTLV-3, had proved that it was the cause of AIDS, and that
they were developing a test for diagnosis. The virus was described in detail in a
series of papers in Science in the May 4, 1984, edition [12–15]. There is no doubt
that these papers contributed greatly to the knowledge of the AIDS virus, even if
the name, and thus the classiﬁcation of the virus, were wrong. However, there are
doubts as to whether the data presented in these papers accurate [16].
Before he isolated HTLV-3, Gallo had twice received samples of LAV, the ﬁrst
on July 17, 1983, the second on September 22. This virus sample was to be used
for comparative purposes, and an agreement had been signed that the virus would
not be used for any commercial purpose without permission from the French
group. Were LAV and HTLV-3 the same virus or similar viruses, and how could
one explain the discrepancy in the earlier papers between the two groups?
Serology tests, cloning, and sequencing eliminated any doubt that the viruses were
the same. Gallo refused to acknowledge that this was possible and claimed that he
could not successfully produce the French virus in culture. In fact, one of his
associates did grow the virus, and knew that Gallo misrepresented the data when
he submitted his papers.
This led to an international controversy as to who had ﬁrst discovered the virus
causing what would later be called AIDS. It was not only a matter of prestige, but
also of ﬁnances, since the discoverer’s institute could patent tests to identify the
virus, bringing considerable proﬁt to the patent owner and institute. Although the
French group was the ﬁrst to apply for a patent, the U.S. patent ofﬁce gave priority
272
15
HIV and AIDS

to Gallo’s claim, resulting in a law suit later brought by the Pasteur Institute,
claiming priority. Eventually an agreement was reached between the NIH and
Pasteur Institute on the division of funds generated through the patents for HIV. In
1986 the International Committee for Viral Nomenclature decided that the new
virus should be called HIV rather than LAV (Montagnier’s nomenclature) or
HTLV-3 (Gallo’s nomenclature). Montagnier and his colleague François Barre-
Sinoussi received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of HIV-1, but Gallo, who did
much of the research, was not awarded the prize. The monograph ‘‘Science Fic-
tions’’ by Crewdson [16] implies a ‘‘conspiracy’’ by Gallo and colleagues at the
NCI to demean and ignore the French group, and to claim priority both for national
prestige as well as ﬁnancial gain.
It is now apparent that the Gallo isolate was the LAV sent to him by Mon-
tagnier. When the original isolates of HTLV-3 and LAV were compared at the
nucleic acid level, the two viruses were 98 % identical. Since each isolate of what
is now called HIV differs, there was no way that these could be separate isolates
from different patients. The virus mutates at such a high rate that even isolates
from the same person after a few months will differ from the original isolate. Gallo
claimed a mix-up in his lab with the different virus strains. In fact, the electron
micrograph published in the May 4th issue of Science describing the isolation of a
new virus was actually a picture of the French isolate of LAV. This virus was
grown in the Gallo lab by a visiting scientist, and the new virus he claimed to have
isolated was really the one he received from France. There appeared to be a
manipulation of facts, dates and actual data concerning the isolation of virus from
differing AIDS patients. The scandal has been described in more detail in a series
of articles in the Chicago Tribune and in John Crewdson’s book [16].
15.3
Social Implications of AIDS
By 1983, the societal ramiﬁcations of the disease were being felt; there was fear,
particularly in the U.S.—not that different from the fear that had occurred with
previous plagues such as yellow fever and polio. There was talk of quarantine, or
even isolation and segregation of AIDS patients. Actual quarantine facilities
(sanatoriums) for infected patients, particularly Cuban soldiers returning from
Angola, were set up. However, after ten years these were closed, but patients
wanting to live in them could continue to do so. Cuba today has a very low
incidence of AIDS, which might be related to its early quarantine step, although
from a civil rights perspective this seemed cruel and certainly infringed on the right
of movement and association. The U.S. and many other countries demanded HIV
testing for immigrants or people traveling to these countries, and those who tested
HIV-positive were denied entry. This, in fact, led to a boycott of AIDS-related
conventions in the U.S. and the law was only rescinded (in 2011).
15.2
Isolation of the Virus
273

In the U.S., patients with AIDS were shunned in their communities: some lost
jobs, others lost housing, and children with AIDS were even expelled from school.
One source of AIDS among the gay community was the bathhouses. Promiscuity
was the norm, men had random sex with other men and only after a struggle,
particularly in San Francisco, were the bathhouses closed in 1984. During the next
few years many conspiracy theories were proposed to explain the AIDS epidemic:
that AIDS was a CIA plot; that it was targeting the African-American community;
and that it was a contaminant of the polio vaccine used in Africa in the late 1950s.
These unwarranted speculations remained as long as the source of AIDS remained
a puzzle. The CDC attempted to calm the public explaining that the virus could
only be transmitted by exposure to blood products, by sharing needles while taking
drugs, or through accidents where blood was exchanged. It was a condition pri-
marily spread through sexual intercourse, and not by sharing cups, hugging,
kissing, or casual contact. Despite these assurances from the CDC, the general
attitude in the country and in the press was one of fear and panic and, as described
below, there were people who did not believe that AIDS was caused by the HIV
virus; indeed, there are probably people who even now who do not accept it.
Infection with HIV resulted in a horrible disease, especially in the early years of
the epidemic, when the only treatments were antibiotics or anti-fungal agents to
inhibit opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections. The disease state was termed
AIDS since one could be HIV-positive without progressing to full-blown AIDS.
The ﬁlm (and play) ‘‘Angels in America’’ by Tony Kushner (2003) presents a
realistic depiction of the suffering of AIDS victims in the early years.
15.4
Why Were Homosexual Males More Likely
to be Infected?
At the beginning of the epidemic, in 1982, HIV/AIDS was known as ‘‘GRID’’—
gay-related immunodeﬁciency disease. The ﬁrst cluster of what we now call
opportunistic infections occurred in gay men. The sub-culture of ‘‘gay’’ men was a
very promiscuous one; oral or anal sex was performed with many different partners
at ‘‘bath-houses’’ or during casual meetings in parks or bars. This resulted in the
rapid spread of the virus throughout the gay community. In the days before AIDS,
sex between men was performed without any protection, since condoms were only
used during heterosexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy. The cause of the
epidemic among gay men was initially thought to be due to the use of ‘‘pop-
pers’’—vials of alkyl nitrites used as an aphrodisiac and to enhance sexual plea-
sure. Poppers accompanied the use of drugs in the 1970s at discos and parties, but
this idea was invalidated when AIDS was discovered in ‘‘straight’’ Haitian men.
One reason for the higher frequency of HIV in gay men was that anal sex was the
preferential mode of sexual behavior. Anal sex may damage the thin lining of the
rectum, allowing the virus to invade the body and enter the systemic circulation.
274
15
HIV and AIDS

HIV can be found in the blood, semen, and pre-seminal ﬂuid in persons infected
with the virus. In general, the person receiving the semen is at greater risk of
getting HIV than the inserter. However, a person who inserts his penis into an
infected partner is also at risk since HIV can enter through the urethra or small
cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis, so it is possible for either sex partner to
become infected with HIV during anal sex. (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/
transmission.htm)
A study in 2010 found that the risk of HIV transmission is 20 times greater with
anal intercourse than with vaginal intercourse [17] http://www.sciencedaily.com/
releases/2010/05/100525094900.htm. In a large study among homosexual men in
1987, there was a very high correlation between those who practiced receptive anal
sex with more than one partner and seroconversion to HIV positive (seroconversion
implies the presence of antibodies to HIV) than those who were not receptive [18].
In a study in San Francisco in 1987, [19, 20] among homosexual/bisexual men
reporting no male sexual partners in the 2 years before inclusion in the study,
seropositivity was 17.6 %. For those reporting more than 50 partners, seroposi-
tivity was 70.8 %. Thus, both anal intercourse and promiscuity played a large part
in the initial epidemic. Similar results were reported later in other studies from
many countries. The number of sexual partners that individual gay men had was in
some cases startling; there are even quotes in the literature of 250 partners per
year! (Whether or not this is true is difﬁcult to say, as it could simply be boasting
about sexual prowess.)
To quote the French physician Jean Paul Escande: ‘‘AIDS is not a divine
lightning bolt, but its advent shows that when a community profoundly changes its
lifestyle, a certain number of diseases will crop up without fail; the excess of
sexual liberalization among homosexuals is probably responsible for the biological
modiﬁcation that fostered the rise of AIDS … AIDS mushroomed not because they
transgressed certain sexual taboos, but rather certain rules for living which, until
then, had concurred to maintain a relative biological equilibrium.’’ [1].
15.5
AIDS in the USA in the 1980s
AIDS cases continued to be reported throughout the early 1980s, both in the U.S.
and other countries. Two unique cases in 1985 brought interest in the AIDS
pandemic to the wider American public through media exposure. What AIDS was
and how it could be transmitted was unknown. What was known were its terrible
effects. As usual in these conditions, the opinion of ignorant people, an opinion
based essentially on senseless fear, becomes common and for a while even
dominant. Popular opinion was reﬂected in the social stigma that was extended to
the victims of the disease, irrespective of the causes of the infections.
Some cases are illustrative and should be remembered; among them is the case of
Ryan White, a 13-year-old hemophiliac, who was diagnosed with AIDS after sur-
gery for partial lung removal (Fig. 15.1). He had been receiving factor VIII for
15.4
Why Were Homosexual Males More Likely to be Infected?
275

treatment of his hemophilia and after it was found that he had contracted AIDS, he
was banned from school in Kokomo, Indiana. He suffered from insults and indig-
nities from his classmates and their parents. Ryan died of AIDS at age 18 in 1990. A
similar case occurred in 1986 after Florida’s Desoto County School Board refused to
allow three HIV-positive brothers—Ricky, Robert, and Randy Ray—to attend
school. A federal judge ordered the board to reinstate the three hemophiliacs, who
had contracted HIV through transfusion of contaminated blood products. Outraged
town residents refused to allow their children to attend school, and someone set ﬁre
to the Ray family’s house on August 28, totally destroying it. This blind bias, so
typical of ignorance, was also exempliﬁed by the action taken by the U.S. Senate,
which passed—96 to 2—the Helm’s amendment banning federal assistance to
groups that promoted AIDS educational material. An opinion piece by the Mayor of
New York attacked the amendment as senseless and callous in a New York Times
opinion
piece
(http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/07/opinion/senator-helms-s-
callousness-toward-aids-victims.html).
Another important media event, which increased awareness of how widespread
the disease had become, was the October 1985 death from AIDS of Rock Hudson,
the popular ﬁlm star, and symbol of the ‘‘macho’’ male. Three months following
Fig. 15.1 Ryan White, 1985
276
15
HIV and AIDS

his death, Randy Shilts published And the Band Played On, which presented an
early history of the disease, particularly as seen in San Francisco, and the political
struggles to close down the bath-houses, a major source of infection in the gay
community. This book was later made into a ﬁlm, which I would urge anyone
interested in this early history of the epidemic to see. Randy Shilts himself died of
AIDS in 1994 at the age of 42. Despite statements from the CDC that the disease
was only spread by sexual relations or contact with blood, people were ﬁred from
their jobs because of the fear that they might transmit the virus through social
contact, sharing the same cup, or being in the same room.
By the end of 1985, 15,400 individuals were diagnosed with AIDS, 12,500
deaths from AIDS were recorded, and the number of HIV-positive people was
much greater. By the end of 1985, it became obvious that the epicenter of the
epidemic was no longer the U.S. but Africa, where the disease had spread very
rapidly because of sexual promiscuity, poverty, general ill health, and malnutri-
tion. Patterns of transmission could be tracked by following truck routes and truck
stops where the presence of sex workers (prostitutes) in both West and East Africa
spread the disease. This was no longer a ‘‘gay’’ disease, but a heterosexually
transmitted one. In February of 1987 the World Health Organization launched
‘‘The Global Program on AIDS’’ to raise awareness; formulate evidence-based
policies; provide technical and ﬁnancial support to countries; initiate relevant
social, behavioral, and biomedical research; promote participation by non-gov-
ernmental organizations; and champion the rights of those living with HIV.
In 1987 there was a turning point in the attitude of the U.S. government and
other governments regarding the AIDS epidemic. By this time, the seriousness of
the pandemic had been realized. A number of action groups had been formed,
including AIDS coalition to Unleash Power (Act-Up) in the U.S. Their aim was to
educate the public about the epidemic, inﬂuence medical research, and change
political and social policy by pressuring the government and the NIH for more
funding to study the disease. However, the social stigma of being a victim of HIV
still existed despite an educational campaign by the CDC and other agencies.
By 1989 there were 117,508 reported cases of AIDS and 89,343 deaths (http://
www.amfar.org/thirty-years-of-hiv/aids-snapshots-of-an-epidemic/).
15.6
Test for AIDS and Blood Supply
A number of pharmaceutical companies developed a test for HIV in 1985. This
test, based on a method called ‘‘enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay’’ (ELISA),
detects antibodies in the blood of infected individuals, who are termed ‘‘sero-
positive.’’ A backup test using Western Blot technology1 (antibody-antigen
1 The story behind the nomenclature ‘‘Western blot’’ is amusing. The ﬁrst type of ‘‘blot’’ that was
used to compare DNA with other DNA samples following separation of DNA on a gel and the
identiﬁcation of spots was called ‘‘Southern blotting’’ after the creator of the technique, Ed
Southern. This was followed by the development of a similar method to detect RNA samples on a
15.5
AIDS in the USA in the 1980s
277

reaction on strips of paper following electrophoresis—a method that separates
proteins and detected by a second antibody linked to a detector [dye]) was used as
a backup. These tests were initially used to examine the safety of the blood supply.
The licensing of the ELISA test was controversial, and a patent for testing for HIV
(at that time called either LAV or HTLV-3) was ﬁled ﬁrst by the Pasteur Institute
with the U.S. patent ofﬁce, but was overlooked, and a second patent ﬁled by NCI
on behalf of Bob Gallo was approved. This second method was neither as efﬁcient
nor as reproducible as the Pasteur method, but with pressure from the NCI was the
one adopted. This resulted in many HIV-positive samples testing as negative and
the use of contaminated blood in transfusions in hospitals. It took 2–3 years and
threats of lawsuits between the NCI and the Pasteur Institute before the Pasteur
ELISA was licensed in the U.S. [16] and became the choice of the American Red
Cross. Both patents were granted and both tests used in the U.S. Each test uses
different antigens and may give different results [21].
The false-positive results caused much personal anguish, since many who
believed themselves ‘‘clean’’ appeared to have acquired the virus, and required
retesting. Some individuals did not retest and assumed they had AIDS, although
they didn’t. All positive tests have to be redone and conﬁrmed by the Western blot.
There is a period of approximately 2 weeks during which one can be infected but
viral antibodies are not present in the blood, and thus one is sero-negative. The test
should be redone at a later time if there is any suspicion of infection. Ethically, if
one tests positive twice, one should stop having sexual relations or at least notify
the sexual partner(s) of possible infection. Psychologically, it is difﬁcult to live
with the threat of AIDS, particularly during a period when no treatment is avail-
able. Also, in the U.S., Canada, Belgium, Italy and Germany, spreading the virus
was often considered a criminal act and could lead to ‘‘isolation’’ in jail. The
literature of this period contains many articles about the denying of the civil rights
of HIV-positive individuals.
The tests, which became more reliable with time due to better puriﬁcation of
viral antigens, measured how many people were carriers of HIV and the extent of
HIV-positive individuals in the population. In 1985 the French blood centers
announced a rate of 1 per 1,000 of seropositivity, which was the same level as
found in the French army. Similar results were found when the U.S. army tested
applicants for military service; this was 100–1,000 times higher than those
apparently suffering from AIDS.
Currently there are nine tests that can detect HIV antibodies, antigens (viral
proteins) and viral nucleic acids. Recently, simple tests have been developed using
urine, or saliva, and can be performed at home at very low cost. However, these
are less reliable than the traditional Western blot. In the U.S., HIV testing is
readily available at local hospitals and clinics for a nominal charge.
(Footnote 1 continued)
blot after electrophoresis and was called the ‘‘Northern Blot.’’ This type of nomenclature was
continued when protein blots were established, and called ‘‘Western blots.’’ We now even have
‘‘South-western’’ and ‘‘Far-western’’ blots, which are variations on the Western blot.

HIV and AIDS

15.7
Why Test?
To prevent an epidemic, it is necessary to know who are the carriers of the disease,
and where these individuals live. Identifying who is positive for HIV may deter
individuals from spreading the disease. Many people (probably the great majority)
do not consider themselves candidates for HIV, and deny that there is such a
possibility. This is particularly true among young people, since risky behavior is
not considered by them to be risky. By the end of 2013, it is estimated that there
will be 30 million people in the world with HIV. Of these, half will have been
infected before the age of 25 and only about 15 % will know that they are HIV-
positive. Since the symptoms of the disease are now treatable, particularly with
drugs accessible worldwide, testing is crucial in preventing the spread. This
assumes that individuals positive for HIV will either cease sexual activity or
inform their partner(s) that they are infected, take precautions, and enter into a
course of treatment. Determining one’s HIV status is the ﬁrst step in treating the
disease, but unfortunately, large segments of the population shun testing. In the
U.S. there are as many as 40,000 new cases of HIV per year. Figure 15.2 illustrates
this point, where as many as 50 % of people of sexually active age are not tested
for HIV.

Test for AIDS and Blood Supply
279

There is also a ﬂip side to testing, in that poorly trained individuals may handle
the testing and analysis, leading to serious consequences. There have been cases
[8] in which individuals have assumed that they had AIDS and were treated for
AIDS with drugs that made them very sick—only to be discovered later that
testing was not performed, and that they were ‘‘clean.’’ These people suffered both
psychologically and physically. In some cases it was the result of a diagnosis
without the test; in others, the ﬁrst test was positive, and the person was not re-
tested. Unfortunately there are still some countries, such as Russia and other
countries of Eastern Europe, where testing is not routine. Many countries now
demand HIV testing before visas are given, particularly for students spending time
abroad.
Therapeutic drugs are available in most of the world, although the costs can be
prohibitive and they only alleviate the symptoms of the disease and don’t cure it.
Many governments subsidize the costs, or produce ‘‘generic’’ copies of the drugs at
a lower cost. Programs have been established by the UN, WHO and the U.S.
government to supply anti-retroviral drugs. Most of those unknowingly infected
and not being tested are in Africa, Southeast Asia and the former USSR, where
treatment may not be available because of cost.
15.8
Anti-retroviral Therapy
Although the epidemic began in 1981, the ﬁrst drug to inhibit HIV replication was
not identiﬁed until 1987 and received FDA approval that same year. For the ﬁrst
years of the epidemic, there was no reasonable medication. Opportunistic infec-
tions were treated with antibiotics and fungicides, as well as interferon, which
inhibited the growth of KS [22]. We now know that KS is caused by herpes virus-
8, [23] so that the interferon may directly inhibit this virus. However, interferon
did not have a consistent inhibitory effect on HIV replication. Since HIV is a
retrovirus, the obvious pharmaceutical target was an enzyme unique to retrovi-
ruses, the reverse transcriptase. Massive screening of oligonucleotides known to
affect either DNA or RNA synthesis took place at drug companies. Most of these
compounds had been developed as potential anti-cancer agents. In 1986 a drug that
appeared to inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase was rediscovered—this was
zidovudine or azidothymidine (AZT), ﬁrst synthesized in 1964 by Gertrude Elion2
2 Gertrude Elion received the Nobel Prize for her work in 1988. She was responsible for the
development of many anti-cancer agents affecting nucleic acid metabolism. She was also one of
the only scientists to receive the Nobel Prize who did not have a Ph.D. Elion graduated from
Hunter College in New York City with a BS degree, but could not obtain admission to a graduate
program, either because she was a woman or because she was Jewish. She later received an MS
from New York University. George Hitchings at Burroughs Wellcome, a large pharmaceutical
company in drug design, eventually employed her to develop drugs against cancer, and she shared
the Nobel Prize with him. I knew her personally from participation in meetings on purine
metabolism. She was a very unassuming woman whose husband died of a bacterial infection in
1941, in the days before antibiotics.
280

at Burroughs Wellcome as an anti-cancer agent, which at that time proved inef-
fective and was placed in storage. However, when screened on retroviruses, it
proved to be an inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, slowing down virus replication.
This drug became the standard treatment for individuals with AIDS; it also became
the prototype small molecule developed against HIV and other viruses. AZT
reduced the amount of circulating virus in the blood and lymph nodes and pre-
vented the collapse and decrease in CD4 lymphocytes, the target cells of the virus.
It could be used until either the virus mutated and became resistant, or until the
side effects were too severe. Initially it was used only after the effects of full-blown
AIDS occurred, but is now recommended early in the infection. Since those early
days, other inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase have been proven effective, but it
took another 3 years for the next inhibitor to reach the clinic.
Over the next few years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs resulted
in the successful introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) into
clinical practice for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still a need for
new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV-1 and, unfor-
tunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug
resistance. Because of the mechanism of HIV replication, it is nearly impossible to
‘‘cure’’ HIV because the virus brings in its own enzyme the reverse transcriptase
and is integrated into the chromosome of the host cell. This enzyme is error prone,
resulting in mutations that escape the immune system. It is possible that an enzyme
(Tre-recombinase) could be developed that removes the virus (or segments of it)
from the human chromosome, and such an enzyme is undergoing testing in cells
and in mice, but it will take years of research before it can be used in humans; the
difﬁculty will be in targeting it to all infected cells. Initial data show that it is
effective in cultured cells, but this is a long way from clinical development.
The current aim of antiretroviral therapy is not to cure the disease but to extend
the life of the patient, prevent opportunistic infections and maintain a decent
quality of life. The objective is to suppress HIV replication to undetectable levels,
i.e., less than 50 copies per ml of blood as measured by PCR. This requires the
infected person to take an expensive regimen of drugs (HAART), which may have
many side effects. The CDC has issued guidelines for the use of HIV medication:
anti-retroviral medication should be administered to pregnant women who are
positive for HIV to reduce the risk to the child and transmission of the virus in
milk.
Treating people with HIV with anti-retroviral drugs lowers the amount of virus
in their body and can dramatically reduce their risk of transmitting HIV to others,
underscoring the importance of HIV testing and access to medical care and
treatment. In fact, a landmark clinical trial in 2011 indicated that people with HIV
who began taking anti-HIV medications early (before their immune systems were
signiﬁcantly weakened) experienced a 96 % reduction in their risk of transmitting
HIV to their sexual partners [24].
The most surprising recommendation of the CDC is the use of pre-exposure
prophylaxis—taking anti-retroviral drugs before sexual activity in high-risk groups
to prevent the infection. The drug tenofovir (Viread), produced by Gilead Biotech,
15.8
Anti-retroviral Therapy
281

is an anti-reverse transcriptase drug that when administered to drug addicts in
Thailand reduced infection by 49 % in an at-risk student population compared to a
placebo. The principal investigator of the study wrote in the Lancet, ‘‘We now
know that pre-exposure prophylaxis can be a potentially vital option for HIV
prevention in people at very high risk for infection, whether through sexual
transmission or injecting drug use’’ [25]. Similar studies with other anti-retroviral
drugs have given similar results.
Anti-retroviral drugs target different segments of the virus, either directly
inhibiting viral proteins or targeting essential viral enzymes such as proteases,
integrase (the enzyme involved in recombination between the viral DNA and the
host chromosome) or blocking attachment and uptake of the virus. These various
targets are shown in Fig. 15.3 and Table 15.1. A description of each class can be
found in more detail at the reference below the table.
15.9
Vaccine Development
It has been extremely difﬁcult to develop a preventative vaccine against HIV-1. A
great deal of effort and research have gone into vaccine development, and various
approaches, including using inactivated virus and the cloning of viral segments

282
15
HIV and AIDS

into other viral vectors, have been attempted but without much success. This stems
from the two major hurdles: the ability of HIV to integrate into the chromosome
and be maintained in the chromosome as DNA and not as a free virus particle, as is
the case with most other viruses, and the fact that HIV, like other RNA viruses,
mutates at a very high rate. Thus within one individual, multiple ‘‘strains’’ or
‘‘quasi-species’’ of viruses may develop, so that viral escape from antibodies
induced by the vaccine will occur very quickly. It is true that vaccines have been
developed against yellow fever and polio—both RNA viruses—but these viruses
replicate in the cytoplasm, do not integrate into the host chromosome, and enter
the bloodstream, where they can be neutralized by antibodies. During the natural
infection with HIV, antibodies are produced (the basis of the AIDS test), yet they
are not sufﬁcient to eliminate the virus, since the virus is ‘‘hiding’’ in immune cells
in lymph nodes.
Despite these problems, in 2010 there were 30 clinical trials in progress, using
40 different vaccines, on four continents, and involving 24 countries—yet none of
these trials was successful at producing a neutralizing antibody. Neutralizing
antibodies are essential to eliminate virus from the blood and lymph nodes. They
are mostly of the classical preventative ‘‘vaccine’’ type. Other groups are working
on a prophylactic vaccine, which would be given to individuals already infected
with HIV, and stimulate the immune system (innate) against the virus. One of the
largest trials was of a recombinant adenovirus containing the internal genes of
HIV, but in trial this vaccine not only did not work to protect against HIV, it also
appeared to increase the frequency of HIV infection. Other vaccine constructs
have not enhanced antibody production enough to destroy the virus. A new
approach may be necessary for ‘‘vaccine’’ production in which the emphasis is on
activation of the innate immune system so that it recognizes infected cells more

efﬁciently [26]. This is difﬁcult, since many immune cells producing cytokines are
themselves targets of the virus.
Another problem with vaccine administration is the inability to differentiate the
person carrying an infectious virus from the non-carrier who now produces anti-
body to the virus as a result of the vaccine itself. Thus by receiving the vaccine, the
individual will seroconvert—that is mimic the infection—without being infected.
Unless infected cells can be eliminated, antibody production by itself will not be
sufﬁcient to prevent infections. A novel vaccine was recently tested in rhesus
macaques infected with a virulent strain of SIV; the monkeys responded to a
vaccine in which SIV genes were expressed in a cytomegalovirus vector. It took
some time for the vaccine to have an effect, but no virus was detectable in any of
the organs of the cured monkeys [27]. Cytomegalovirus is common in humans, and
most humans have antibodies to the virus, thus inhibiting it as a vaccine. Incor-
porating HIV protein sequences into other herpes virus needs to be attempted. It
appears that the presence of the cytomegalovirus caused a strong killer T-cell
reaction, and the replication-competent SIV persisted for months in the monkeys
before disappearing. The authors conclude that ‘‘These data provide compelling
evidence for progressive clearance of a pathogenic lentiviral infection, and suggest
that some lentiviral reservoirs may be susceptible to the continuous effector
memory T-cell-mediated immune surveillance elicited and maintained by cyto-
megalovirus vectors.’’
15.10 The Scandals of Contaminated Blood
As mentioned above, it was difﬁcult to convince the American Red Cross and
companies such as Bayer, Baxter, and others that contaminated blood might be a
source of HIV, particularly in the preparation of factor VIII and IX used in treating
hemophiliacs. In the U.S. about 10,000 hemophiliacs became HIV positive as a
result of contaminated or untested blood products. In Canada, the Canadian Red
Cross delayed implementation of blood treatment (heating) to destroy HIV and
hepatitis B, resulting in contaminated blood, used to prepare factors for hemophil-
iacs. However, in many other countries, contaminated blood was used for blood
transfusions and not only in the preparation offactor VIII. In some cases, companies
producing these factors for hemophiliacs continued to sell contaminated products in
Asia, to avoid dumping the products on hand, as late as 1985. Such products were
unacceptable in the U.S. and the factors were produced by an alternate method,
and there were strict controls on who could sell whole blood. (See follow-up article

HIV and AIDS

15.11 Romania
Physicians in many countries, particularly Eastern Europe, believe that fresh
transfusions of blood can alleviate many symptoms of illnesses, not necessarily
related to blood diseases themselves. Not only was contaminated blood used in
most cases, but needles or other instruments were not sterilized between uses. The
most glaring instance of this (or the most published) was the situation of orphans in
institutions in Romania, which came to light after the fall of Ceausescu and the
communist government. There was a complete lack of hygiene in these institu-
tions, with thousands of children infected with HIV and hepatitis B. These HIV
children, known as ‘‘Ceausescu’s abandoned children,’’ were discovered 20 years
ago and many still live in orphanages under dire conditions. Most of them were not
HIV-positive from maternal transmission but as a result of the lack of care and the
use of contaminated needles for injection. These babies or children received blood
as a nutrient with one needle used in a ward of a few hundred children.
Before 1989, birth control and abortions were illegal in Romania for any
woman who had fewer than ﬁve children, and this led to the abandonment of many
children in state institutions under the most appalling conditions. By 1985, many
of these children had HIV, but the government refused to recognize that such a
disease could exist in Romania, and physicians were too afraid to discuss it [30].
Under the communist regime, one was living in a perfect society where homo-
sexuality and prostitution did not exist. By mid-2002, after the fall of Ceausescu,
12,559 cases of HIV were registered in Romania (9,936 of them in children), of
which 2,699 had already died. Most were infected with a clade (group) known as
type F, which was unique to that area of the world. Many of these orphans have
reached adulthood, and still suffer from the disease or other conditions. The
Romanian government has instituted treatment centers, and was one of the ﬁrst
countries in Eastern Europe—after the collapse of communism—to grapple with
this problem. However, there are still economic difﬁculties in housing and treat-
ment of the survivors of this epidemic. Romania is now often held up as a model
on how to deal with the AIDS epidemic, and treatment with anti-retrovirus drugs is
free. However, there is still a sizeable part of the population that is unaware that
they are carriers of the disease [30–32].
15.12 Contaminated Blood in China and Other
Asian Countries
Even though HIV was discovered and characterized as a sexually and blood-
transmitted disease by the mid-1980s, many countries still continued to use con-
taminated blood in hospitals, thereby increasing the number of victims,
15.11

285

particularly among children. In the Henan province in China, farmers sold their
blood for $5.00 per 400cc, with some of them giving blood as much as 50 times.
The blood was pooled and the serum separated; red blood cells from the pool were
then transfused back into the sellers; this was thought to prevent blood loss. Thus
any contaminated blood, even from one individual, would then reach many. The
conditions of collection and transfusion were unsatisfactory. Around 80 % of the
inhabitants of Donghu are today HIV-positive, among the highest in the world,
[33] and many already have the symptoms of AIDS. However, similar methods are
still being used in other provinces in China. The tragedy, in such cases, is not only
the spread of AIDS to the total population, but also to newborn children from
infected mothers. The Chinese government has tried to suppress this information,
and there has been little done in terms of treatment outside of the large cities [34,
35]. Part of the problem was the proﬁt motive, in which government ofﬁcials ran
the blood-collecting stations and sold the serum to pharmaceutical companies for
the production of serum by-products. Until 1994, there was no screening of blood
supplies for HIV in China.
A similar incident occurred in Kazakhstan in the summer of 2006; [36, 37] One
hundred and eighteen children became HIV-positive as a result of blood transfu-
sions ordered by health workers. By 2007, ten of them had died, and the doctors
were charged with malpractice. Patients had paid $20 for blood collection; the
physicians received $10 and the local blood bank the remaining $10. One child
was given as many as 25 unnecessary blood transfusions. On July 2007, 17 of the
21 health care workers were given jail sentences of a few months to 8 years. The
disease has spread throughout the country, and it is estimated that there are any-
where from 6,000 to 30,000 carriers of the disease. As in other countries of Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, the government has passed legislation to
protect victims of the disease and ensure human rights and laws against
discrimination.
Nonetheless, despite a decrease in new cases of HIV in the U.S., Western
Europe and Africa, the incidence of HIV/AIDS is increasing in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia. The latest statistics show that 1.5 million people in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia are living with HIV, 3.5 times the number for 2001 (410,000) and
more than 10 times than in 1991. In these countries, there is a lack of anti-
retroviral drugs, and most of the disease occurs in marginalized populations such
as drug addicts, and men who have sex with men, sex workers, prisoners and
migrants. Tuberculosis and end-stage liver disease caused by viral hepatitis C
infection are among the leading causes of death among people living with HIV/
AIDS, particularly those who are also addicted to drugs. At 170,000 new HIV
infections, the region trailed only sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast
Asia in terms of new HIV infections in 2011. But the numbers in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia are on an upward trend, unlike those in sub-Saharan Africa and
South and Southeast Asia, which appear to be stabilizing and declining.

HIV and AIDS

15.13 Origin of HIV
Where did HIV come from? When did it ﬁrst enter the human population? Is it a
‘‘new’’ virus or an old virus that has resurfaced?
Although there was an extensive search for HIV-1 among primates immediately
after the discovery of the virus, a nearly identical virus was not discovered until
1999 [38]. A large number of similar retroviruses have been discovered in different
species of primates and in other mammals, such as cats. Such viruses cause
immunodeﬁciency in these animals and have been termed SIV (simian for mon-
key), and FeIV (cat immunodeﬁciency). However, a virus nearly identical to HIV-
1 was discovered in preserved tissue of a sub-species of chimpanzee, pan trog-
lodytes troglodytes that are native to Gabon, Cameroon, and Equatorial Africa in
Central West Africa. This virus itself appeared to be a hybrid between two dif-
ferent strains of SIV, SIVcpz and SIVgor. Chimpanzees and gorillas are the only
non-human primates to carry a virus closely related to HIV. Phylogenic analysis
has indicated that the chimpanzees were infected the virus SIVgor from gorillas,
and that a recombinant virus between the two SIVs jumped species into humans to
form HIV subgroups infecting humans. It is thought that this SIV jumped species
at least four separate times. The species have been hunted for a long time and used
as meat, so it was very easy for the virus to be transmitted in blood to humans
through handling or eating poorly cooked meat.
HIV-2 is related to an SIV that occurs in the sooty mangabey, a species of
monkey, and is thought to have been transmitted to humans in the 1960s in
Guinea-Bissau in Western Africa.
Following are the earliest known instances of HIV infection:
A plasma sample taken in 1959 from an adult male who died in the Congo was
shown to be HIV positive [39]. A lymph node sample taken in 1960 from an adult
female, also from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was HIV positive [40].
Both isolates were of a different subtype. These examples indicated heterogeneity
in the virus, indicating that it may have been present in Kinshasa for a considerable
time.
Robert Rayford was an American teenager admitted to Barnes Hospital in St
Louis, Missouri, who died a few years later from a ‘‘mysterious’’ disease in 1969.
At the time of his death, samples of tissue were frozen. When AIDS appeared in
the 1980s, samples from these tissues were tested for the presence of HIV by
Western blots, and HIV proteins were detected. Rayford was suspected of being a
male prostitute. He did not travel abroad, indicating that HIV was already present
in the U.S. as early as the 1960s. Many other cases were probably incorrectly
diagnosed and were due to HIV.
HIV-positive samples from a Norwegian sailor who died around 1976. He
contracted the disease in Africa. Arvid Noe (his name) began working as a sailor in
1961 at age 15. He is known to have visited Africa at least twice, to have worked
as a truck driver in Europe, and is assumed to have frequented prostitutes in the
15.13
Origin of HIV
287

Cameroons. Beginning in 1966, Noe suffered from joint pain, lymphedema, and
lung infections. His condition stabilized with treatment until 1975, when Noe’s
symptoms worsened, and he developed motor control difﬁculties, dementia, and
died. His wife developed similar symptoms; she and their nine-year-old daughter
both died in 1977. About 10 years after their death, doctors in Norway examined
tissue samples of all three and found that they were positive for HIV1; the type of
HIV was similar to that found in the Cameroons. Noe may have transmitted the
virus to prostitutes in Africa and Europe.
Grete Rask was a Danish surgeon who travelled to Zaire in 1972. She was
probably exposed to blood from Congolese patients. Returning to Denmark in
1976, she was ill and her symptoms bafﬂed her colleagues. She died in 1977 and in
1984 her tissue was examined for HIV and found to be positive.
Workers returning from the Congo to Haiti probably brought HIV to the
Western Hemisphere. The ﬁrst reported case was in 1966, but of course at that
time the symptoms were not recognized as AIDS. A 1998 analysis of the plasma
sample from 1959 suggested that HIV-1 was introduced into humans around the
1940s or early 1950s. The virus has evolved since then into 11 different subtypes
(clades). Scientists believe that 1959 is near the branch point where the B and D
subtypes branched off. The B subtype is the dominant one in the U.S; using
sequence and statistical analysis, it is hypothesized that HIV had existed in the
U.S. for 12 years before the epidemic was recognized [40]. There appears to be no
doubt that the virus originated in the Congo in the 1940s or 1950s or even earlier,
was then transmitted to Haiti, possibly in a single case, and then transmitted to the
U.S. in the 1960s with a group of Haitian immigrants. From there it eventually
made its way into the general population.
15.14 AIDS in 2013
There is no doubt that the AIDs epidemic is under control in most parts of the
world, and that there is an increase in the number of people living with AIDS,
mostly due to the success of the HAART treatment. Although expensive, this
treatment is now available in most countries, although there are a few exceptions,
either for economic or political (ideological) reasons. The number of new cases is
still high, and there has been an unfortunate tendency, particularly among young
adults, to think of AIDS as just another chronic disease that can be kept under
control. Most of the new infections arise from intravenous drug use and not using
condoms during sexual activity. Large sums of money and time have been spent on
educational activities, and this has inﬂuenced large segments of the population
towards safe sex, in particular in Africa; circumcision (discussed below) is also a
factor. Statistically, there has been an obvious decline in both the number of deaths
and new cases since the peak of the epidemic, which was around 1997–2000.
These statistics in a countrywide fashion can be found at http://apps.who.int/gho/
data/node.main.620?lang=en. The decline in each of the categories, new cases,
288
15
HIV and AIDS

deaths, etc., are presented below, before a discussion of individual countries and
continents.
In 2012 there were 35 million people living with HIV worldwide (this is not the
same as living with AIDS).
Since the start of the epidemic, there have been about 75 million people
infected with HIV.
New HIV infections have fallen by 33 % since 2001. Worldwide, 2.3 million
people became newly infected with HIV in 2012, down from 3.4 million in 2001.
New HIV infections among adults and adolescents decreased by 50 % or more
in 26 countries between 2001 and 2012.
New HIV infections among children have declined by 52 % since 2001.
Worldwide, 260,000 children became newly infected with HIV in 2012, down
from 550,000 in 2001 (Figs. 15.4, 15.5).
15.15 AIDS in Africa
The population of the African continent is approximately one billion. When one
considers this population, one has to take into consideration the fact that the con-
tinent is made up of various ethnic groups, and various countries, each with its own
Fig. 15.4 Total number of people dying from AIDS. Note decrease due to anti-retroviral therapy

culture. The sexual mores of many of the African countries and tribes are different
from those of Western Europe and should not be judged in the same way. Polygamy
is common, and in many countries of Africa, sex outside the home, or outside the
family, is frequent. Rituals for boys to achieve ‘‘manhood’’ may involve sex or
mutilation, and similar practices may occur in young girls. In some countries, male
circumcision is practiced and that could lead to a lower incidence of AIDS; in other
countries it is resisted. Circumcision is associated with different tribes and ethnic-
ities. It is estimated that in 2011 there were 22.9 million adults and children living
with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, around 1.2 million people died there from
AIDS, and 1.9 million people became infected with HIV. Since the beginning of the
epidemic, 14.8 million children have lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS (see
more at: http://www.avert.org/hiv-and-aids-africa.htm#sthash.g6q92aat.dpuf).
In Somalia and Senegal, the HIV prevalence is under 1 % of the adult popu-
lation, whereas in Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, around 10–15 % of adults are
infected with HIV. Southern Africa is the worst impacted by AIDS; in South
Africa, the HIV prevalence is 17.8 % and in three other Southern African coun-
tries, the national adult HIV incidence rate now exceeds 20 %. These countries are
Botswana (24.8 %), Lesotho (23.6 %) and Swaziland (25.9 %).

HIV and AIDS

Western Africa has been less affected by HIV and AIDS than Southern Africa,
but some countries are experiencing rising HIV prevalence rates. In Cameroon,
HIV occurrence is now estimated at 5.3 % and in Gabon it stands at 5.2 %. In
Nigeria, HIV incidence is low (3.6 %), compared to the rest of Africa. However,
because of its large population (it is the most populous country in sub-Saharan
Africa), this means that around 3.3 million people are living with HIV. Adult HIV
prevalence in East Africa exceeds 5 % in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.
Overall, rates of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa appear to have
peaked in the late 1990s, and HIV prevalence seems to have declined slightly,
although it remains at an extremely high level of 5 % among adults.
In 2012, the number of new infections with HIV was in decline due to education
and the availability of condoms, and the decline from previous years is quite
startling. There was also a decline in the number of AIDS cases in children due to
increased availability of anti-retroviral drugs at time of delivery.
The consequences of the AIDS epidemic have been quite disastrous in some
countries, such as South Africa. It has left vast numbers of orphans that have to be
cared for by the State. Education, agriculture and industrial development have all
been disrupted. Each community faces the challenge of treating HIV, using scarce
resources for health facilities, and dependency on foreign aid. Large strides have
been made in the distribution of anti-retrovirus drugs and in testing for HIV. The
large number of cases of HIV in South Africa is due to either ignoring the early
stages of the epidemic (a disease affecting only a marginalized segment of soci-
ety—homosexuals and prostitutes) or due to bad government policy, which relied
on AIDS deniers as advisors, and pseudo-science [41]. In 1995 the decision was
made by the government (Ministry of Health) to launch a musical based on a
popular ﬁlm, ‘‘Saraﬁna,’’ with an anti-AIDS message. This was to be called
‘‘Saraﬁna II,’’ at a cost of over $1.5 million. The message of the play was not clear,
and AIDS advocacy groups were not consulted. The money had come from the
European Union and led to a scandal investigated by the public prosecutor. This
led to a cancellation of the program and worsening relations between AIDS
groups, NGOs and the government.
The second major scandal that involved politics and corruption was the attempt
to develop an ‘‘African’’ medication for AIDS. This was the development of
Virodene in 1997, which turned out to be an industrial solvent (similar to anti-
freeze) that had been tested for the treatment of cancer and had been shown to be
useless and toxic. A group at the University of Pretoria administered it to a group
of AIDS patients without permission of the equivalent of the local human subject
committee. The owners of the company developing Virodene complained to the
government that various AIDS action organizations were blocking the develop-
ment of this drug and harming their patent. The Medicine Controls Council
(equivalent to the U.S. FDA) rejected the drug, but pressure was put on various
authorities to accept it, and it raised hopes in the AIDS population. It was also
rumored that Thabo Mbeke, head of the African National Council, was ﬁnancially
15.15
AIDS in Africa
291

involved in the development of this drug and held up the use of other anti-
retrovirus treatments. In 1999, Mbeke became president and the policy towards
AIDS and treatment worsened. Members of the Medicine Control Council who
opposed him were replaced.
In 1998, then-Health Minister Dlamini Zuma refused to allow the use of AZT
for the treatment of HIV, in particular in pregnant women, on the excuse that it
was too costly to test for HIV and too costly to subsidize formula for lactating
mothers. since carriers of HIV should not breastfeed their babies. Despite the
appointment of a new minister of health, the policy of denial continued. Peter
Duesberg, a professor at the University of California Berkeley and the best-known
denialist in the U.S., was appointed an advisor. His appointment is blamed for the
refusal of the South African government to treat patients with anti-retroviral drugs
with the resulting millions of deaths. The conﬂict between the president and the
scientiﬁc community continued with a number of public letters and statements.
Mbeki inferred that scientists who stuck to the established view that HIV causes
AIDS were suppressing freedom of speech or were servants of the pharmaceutical
industry. Three South African scientists offered a rebuke in Nature, writing that
‘‘As long as Mr. Mbeki is being advised by people with no credibility, we as South
African scientists feel dangerously marginalized in the search for solutions to HIV/
AIDS.’’
The inﬂuence of Mbeki’s skepticism about the causes of AIDS continued until
his party asked to step down as president in 2008. Things changed for the better in
2009 with the appointment of Jacob Zuma as president. He has encouraged the use
of accepted medications and the rate of new HIV incidence has fallen.
The percentage of people with HIV/AIDS in South Africa is about 17.3 %. In
Kwa-Zulu Natal province, the percentage is as high as 40 % of 15–49 year olds,
an astounding number. The number of orphans in Africa, not only in South
Africa, is also astounding (see Table 15.2); the age of orphans, however, is fairly

consistent across the countries. Surveys suggest that overall, about 15 % of
orphans are 0–4 years old, 35 % are 5–9 years old, and 50 % are 10–14 years
old.
15.16 Male Circumcision and AIDS
There have been numerous reports, both scientiﬁc studies and observations, that
male circumcision offers a signiﬁcant protective effect against the spread of AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases [42]. Studies done in sub-Saharan Africa
indicated that a majority of men were willing to be circumcised. A randomized,
controlled trial of male circumcision in 2005 to examine the effect on HIV inci-
dence in Orange Farm, South Africa, was stopped prematurely due to an observed
high protective effect of circumcision. There was a 63 % decrease in heterosexual
transmission of HIV compared to that of uncircumcised men. This was a large
study, with 3,273 men participating. Similar studies in Kenya and Uganda have
given similar results. Uncircumcised men were twice as likely to contract AIDS as
a result of heterosexual transfer as circumcised men. Studies of rates of HIV have
shown a direct correlation between male circumcision and HIV prevalence in
African countries. In general, about 70 % of African men are circumcised, and
countries or tribes in which circumcision was not practiced show a signiﬁcantly
higher rate of HIV. The foreskin, which is removed from the penis during cir-
cumcision, is very rich in Langerhans cells, a dendritic cell that easily takes up
HIV and can thus transport the virus to other sites in the body. The foreskin is also
easily damaged (cuts, abrasions) during intercourse. Thus, removing the foreskin
removes cells of the immune system that are targets of the virus.
15.17 AIDS in the USA in 2013
By 2012, about 650,000 people had died of AIDS in the U.S., about 68 % of them
under the age of 45. The peak of deaths from AIDS in the U.S. was reached in
1994, 15 years after the disease was ﬁrst identiﬁed. The numbers of deaths have
decreased since then and have leveled out to around 20,000 per year. AIDS was the
sixth leading cause of death among 22–45-year-olds, down from number 1 in 1994
and 1995, due to the introduction of a regimen of anti-HIV drugs known as
HAART in 1995. This development was a major innovation in the treatment of
HIV/AIDS. Many physicians talk about ‘‘the days before HAART and the days
after HAART.’’ Immediately after putting a patient on the HAART regimen, the
CD4 count increases and within a short time reaches normal levels.
It is estimated that as of 2013 there are about 1.1 million individuals with HIV/
AIDS in North America. Although there has been a decrease or leveling off of the
incidence of the disease, there has been an increase in recent years among people
in the 16–25 age group because of the increase in the use of recreational drugs and
15.15
AIDS in Africa
293

an increase in sexual activity without precautions. This is a result of the acceptance
of AIDs as just another chronic disease, like diabetes or asthma. The number of
new infections has been about 50,000 per year, and has remained constant for the
last few years. New cases have decreased among women, but increased among gay
and bisexual men. Although the number of people being tested has increased, a
sizeable proportion of the population has not been tested, including people who are
newly diagnosed with AIDS (about 32 % diagnosed late had not been previously
tested). Most cases of AIDS occur in the major cities, although there are pockets in
the southern states; the hardest hit are California, Florida, and Texas, with African
Americans and Latinos having the highest rates of new infections. In 2010 the
rates of infection in African Americans was about eight times higher than in
whites, and in Latinos about three times higher. Teens and young adults continue
to be at risk, with those under 35 accounting for 56 % of new HIV infections in
2010 (those aged 13–24 accounted for 26 % and those aged 25–34 accounted for
31 %). Most young people are infected sexually. While estimates show that gay
men comprise only about 3–4 % of the U.S. population, this group accounts for
most new HIV infections (63 % in 2010, with an additional 3 % occurring in gay
people with a history of intravenous drug use). Between 2008 and 2010, annual
new HIV infections increased 12 % among homosexual men (Fig. 15.6).
The cost of the epidemic is enormous. In 2012 the federal funding to combat
AIDS was $27.7 billion—53 % of it was for care, 10 % for research, 3 % for
prevention, and 21 % for international assistance. (More information on all of
these topics can be found at http://kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/the-hivaids-epidemic-
in-the-united-states/.)
15.18 AIDS in Asia
From 2005 to 2009 there have been striking increases in the number of people with
HIV in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. In Asia, there are now about 5
million people with HIV/AIDS. As a percentage of the population, this is much
lower than in sub-Saharan Africa or the U.S. In many Asian countries, the sex trade
is ﬂourishing; men pay for sex and then transmit the disease back to their wives.
However, in Eastern Europe, most of the infections are related to intravenous drug
use. In India we are just beginning to see the epidemic appear, with about 2 million
people infected out of a total population of 1 billion. The virus is found predomi-
nantly in rural areas, where information on treatment and prevention is scarce, and
no medication is available. There are currently (2011) an estimated 780,000 people
living with HIV in China, including about 154,000 AIDS patients, and in 2011
around 28,000 people died from AIDS. This may be an underestimate, since for
many years the Chinese authorities denied the existence of AIDS in the country.
These numbers must be considered in the context of China’s extremely large
population, which is estimated at around 1.3 billion. Although China’s HIV epi-
demic remains one of low prevalence overall (0.058 %), there are pockets of high
294
15
HIV and AIDS

infection among speciﬁc sub-populations, such as farmers in outlying provinces,
and the danger of the epidemic spreading further into the general population per-
sists. This became particularly evident in 2009 when China reported that AIDS had
become the country’s leading cause of death from infectious diseases for the ﬁrst
time ever, surpassing both tuberculosis and rabies. Since the mid-1990s, the Chi-
nese government has begun to clean up the blood supply; it has succeeded to some
extent, although there are still pockets of blood-collecting stations where conditions
are still unhygienic. The Chinese government has initiated programs of treatment
and education of the public, although most Chinese are unaware of what causes the
disease, and do not know how to prevent it. In a recent poll, reported in a Web site
run by the journal Science, 1 in 6 had never heard of HIV or AIDS. Of those who
did, 48 % thought it could be transmitted by mosquitoes and were unaware of
sexual transmission [43, 44] (numbers from WHO).
Nevertheless, a study of over 6,000 residents in 2008 found that lack of
knowledge and stigma remain a problem. It found that 48 % of respondents
thought they could become infected from mosquito bites; 18 % believed they

could become infected from a sneezing or coughing person with HIV; 32 % of
interviewees thought people with HIV and AIDS deserved their condition because
of their drug use or sexual behavior; 48 % would not eat with someone who had
HIV; and 30 % thought children with HIV should not attend the same schools as
uninfected children (from http://www.avert.org/hiv-aids-china.htm).
15.19 Aids in Russia and the Former Soviet Union
Russia may now has the largest HIV epidemic in Europe. For some time it was
ignored or denied, since homosexuality is severely frowned upon in Russian soci-
ety. In fact, in 2013 the Russian parliament passed laws outlawing ‘‘homosexual’’
propaganda. ‘‘Gays’’ are often beaten up in the streets and discriminated against. It
is very difﬁcult to get accurate information on the numbers of HIV-positive indi-
viduals or the extent of AIDS, and statistics from Russian government sources
underestimate the number of people with AIDS. According to the UNAIDS, it is
estimated that in 2011 there were from 780,000 to 1.3 million people living with
AIDS in Russia and approximately 38,000–78,000 deaths. The major route of
transmission in Russia and the other former Soviet republics is by intravenous drug
use and prostitution; most of the cases in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic countries
are due to needle exchange. Drug use is a big problem in Russia, and an estimated
5–8 % of men under 30 have injected drugs. It was not until 2006 that the Russian
government formed a National Advisory Council on AIDS. Of the new infections,
about 44 % are in women. In total, about 1.6 % of the population of the Ukraine and
1.1 % of the population of Russia are infected, which is the highest percentage
outside of Africa.
New infections in Eastern Europe and Central Asia have risen 22 % since 2005
and show no sign of slowing, according to the World Health Organization’s Euro-
pean Action Plan for HIV/AIDS 2012–2015. As in ‘‘AIDs in Africa,’’ the control of
this disease rests to large extent on the attitudes of the people and the government
toward sexual behavior, and changes instituted in this behavior. As was initially true
in the U.S., it was assumed that HIV infection was not a general phenomenon, but
occurred in a small segment of the population (in the U.S. in ‘‘gays’’), and in Russia
of today, it occurs mostly among drug addicts and people at the fringes of society.
Thus the Russian government has not seen the necessity of investing large sums of
money on treatment or education. In fact, Russia and many of the other former
Soviet Republics, incarcerate drug addicts for possession of small amounts of drugs,
and such people are considered the ‘‘dregs’’ of society who should be ignored rather
than treated. The disease also spreads among the sexual partners of drug addicts, and
thus there is a high percentage of women with AIDS. So far, AIDS has not spread
into the ‘‘general’’ population (as it did in Africa), and is thus not identiﬁed as a
major problem. Most treatment centers and funding are derived from non-govern-
ment medical organizations (NGOs), many of which are frowned upon by the
Russian and other governments as interfering in internal affairs.

15.20 The Public Relations Campaign Against AIDS
After the recognition of AIDS as an infectious disease, a vigorous campaign was
launched to prevent the spread of the disease. This has included exhortations for
complete abstinence of sexual activity to safe sex using condoms. It has taken the
form of advertisements on public billboards, reports on radio and television, and
even in parts of Africa, of acting troupes simulating the putting on of condoms and
singing, ‘‘Just say no’’. In large part, this campaign has been successful. In some
countries where AIDS had reached epidemic proportions, such as Uganda, the
campaign has had an effect; part of its success arises from the open discussion of
this previously ‘‘taboo’’ subject by leaders, and by testing for the presence of HIV
in the population. In many parts of Africa, the use of condoms has not been
accepted, and therefore testing and education have become the prime focus. One
also has to target these messages to the most sexually active sector of the popu-
lation—the young (teens and young adults), sex workers, and also truck drivers
and workers who move from one location to another. In parts of Africa the slogan
has been ‘‘ABCD’’: Abstain, Be faithful, Condomize, Disclose. This and other
slogans are printed on T-shirts for distribution so that the population is aware of
AIDS at all times. A very good presentation of methods for educating a population
is discussed in http://www.etu.org.za/toolbox/docs/aids/prevention.html, produced
by an organization in South Africa, where AIDS was ignored for too long and not
accepted as an infectious disease.
Although AIDS can be considered a ‘‘plague’’—just like inﬂuenza or even the
black death—because of the long latent period may take 10 years or more, it has
not had the same impact as those other infections in which the onset of disease and
death occurred within a few days of each other. One did not see thousands of
corpses on the streets of New York, Philadelphia, or London as in other plagues;
even in sub-Saharan Africa, one does not see masses of bodies, since death is a
slow, painful process and provisions can be made for the impending demise of the
infected individual. After the initial shock and panic from the initial outbreak of
AIDS in the U.S., there appears to be a readjustment to the disease, and an
acceptance that many people will die at a young age, or that in some societies there
will be large numbers of orphans. A vigorous anti-HIV campaign, through alter-
ations in sexual behavior, has had limited success in many countries, but the extent
of the AIDS epidemic has not hit home in many other places, where it is denied or
ignored (e.g., Russia and China). At least in the U.S. by 2012 it appears that the
disease is accepted as a chronic condition that can be kept at bay with large
numbers of drugs, so AIDS is no longer considered to be a life-threatening disease.
This has resulted in the lowering of the guard against the disease and an increase in
the number of infected individuals in the last few years.

15.21 Conspiracy Theories and AIDS Denial
Although the evidence that HIV is the causative agent of AIDS is generally
accepted, particularly in light of sequencing data and discovery of HIV sequences
in samples from pre-epidemic and the tracking of the virus from its beginning,
there are still those who are skeptical of these reports and have come up with other
theories. There are also many ‘‘conspiracy theories’’ about how HIV evolved, as a
result of human activities to deliberately cause an infection or by accident. These
are presented below.
15.21.1
Oral Polio Vaccine Theory
According to this theory, HIV was introduced as a contaminant in the oral polio
vaccine developed by Hilary Koprowski and administered in the Congo. Ko-
prowski was in competition with Sabin and Salk for development of the ﬁrst polio
vaccine in the 1950s; in fact, his vaccine was the ﬁrst to be given to children in the
U.S., and then administered to populations in Africa. The virus used in these
vaccines was produced in chimpanzee cells. This theory is presented in a well-
documented book, The River, by Hooper [45] a BBC correspondent. However, the
examination of cell lines dating back to this time period, and also to the vaccine
itself, could not conﬁrm any of these accusations. Moreover, studies of the
chimpanzees of this area of the Congo show that the chimpanzees are endemically
infected with SIVcpz, which is vastly different from HIV, ruling them out as a
source of the virus. Recent calculations using DNA sequences indicate that HIV
was ﬁrst transmitted to man about 30 years before the oral polio vaccine trials and
it went unrecognized as a unique disease.
15.21.2
Virus Developed by Humans for Political Purposes
In an interview with Time Magazine (2004), the Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Wangari Maathai alleged that AIDS was a biological weapon manufactured by
white people to wipe out the black race. This statement in itself is absurd, since the
ﬁrst victims of the disease in the U.S. were predominantly Caucasian males.
Maathai, who is Kenyan, received the Nobel Prize for her contribution to sus-
tainable development, democracy and peace. In 2004 she made her accusation
against Caucasian scientists or claimed that the virus resulted from a botched
experiment, and she did not believe that it originated from primates. However, she
did retract her statement in 2006, issuing the following statement: ‘‘I have warned
people against false beliefs and misinformation such as attributing this disease to a
curse from God or believing that sleeping with a virgin cures the infection. These
298
15
HIV and AIDS

prevalent beliefs in my region have led to an upsurge in rape and violence against
children. It is within this context, also complicated by the cultural and religious
perspective, that I often speak. I have therefore been shocked by the ongoing
debate generated by what I am purported to have said. It is therefore critical for me
to state that I neither say nor believe that the virus was developed by white people
or white powers in order to destroy the African people. Such views are wicked and
destructive.’’
A number of similar theories involving the U.S. government have been pro-
posed at various times. Jakob Segal, a former biology professor at Humboldt
University in East Germany, proposed that HIV was manufactured by Robert
Gallo at Fort Detrick, by splicing together two viruses—Visna (a retrovirus—
lentivirus), and HTLV-1 (a human leukemia virus). According to this theory, the
virus was tested on prisoners who volunteered for these experiments in exchange
for early release. He claimed that HIV was predominantly a Visna virus. However,
RNA analysis of HIV has shown little or no relationship to the above two viruses.
It is thought that Segal might have been a Soviet agent distributing false infor-
mation, but there is quite a bit of correspondence on the Internet on this theory.
(For anyone interested, see http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Urgent_Action/AIDS_
Contract.html)
Others have come up with similar claims. Dr. Alan Cantwell says that HIV is a
genetically modiﬁed organism developed by U.S. scientists, and it was introduced
into the human population through hepatitis B experiments performed on gay and
bisexual men between 1978 and 1981. He presented his theory in a book titled
Queer Blood, in which he claims that this was a plot to eliminate gay people from
the U.S. Many other conspiracy theories have been proposed, in particular one by
Dr. Leonard Horowitz that is based on ﬂimsy evidence. Many of these conspiracy
theories can be found on the Internet, although none is supported by scientiﬁc
evidence.
15.21.3
AIDS Denial
Perhaps the most controversial opinion about the relationship between HIV and
AIDs has come from an eminent virologist, Peter Duesberg, who refuses to accept
the linkage between the virus and the condition we call AIDS. In his opinion, HIV
is a harmless ‘‘passenger’’ virus, and the number of cases of AIDS has been grossly
exaggerated, particularly in Africa. To summarize: Duesberg claims that AIDS is
the result of indulgence in drugs, both as stimulants and for sexual arousal. He
states that there is no linkage between the presence of the virus and AIDS. Millions
in Africa will test positive for HIV but not have symptoms of AIDS. Most of the
symptoms we do see are part of the normal disease state of the African population.
As far as Europe and the Americas are concerned, most AIDS cases are due to
15.21
Conspiracy Theories and AIDS Denial

recreational drugs. The epidemic does not follow the normal paths of an epidemic,
i.e., a bell-shaped curve as the virus spreads, and then a petering out as the
population becomes resistant. In fact, the rate of cases of AIDS over the last few
years has been constant. The HIV-AIDS hypothesis offers no explanation for why
less than 1 % of HIV antibody-positive people develop AIDS and why the mean
latency between infection and disease is ﬁve years, whereas antiviral immunity is
established in a few weeks. One might expect the destruction of T-cells imme-
diately if the virus is going to replicate in such cells. A latent period for patho-
genicity that exceeds the latent period for immunity is unambiguous evidence of a
co-factor or another causative agent altogether. Finally, the hypothesis cannot
support a claim that the virus is even necessary for AIDS, in view of the fact that it
is barely present and consistently latent, even in persons with the disease. Since the
transmission of AIDS depends on frequent contacts involving the exchange of
cells, the case for a viral cause remains open. Moreover, Duesberg claims that HIV
does not meet Koch’s ﬁrst postulate, that it has not been possible to identify free
virus in all cases of AIDS [46, 47]. Almost all of these statements have now been
contradicted as methodologies have improved. In fact, there is an answer to most
of Duesberg’s arguments; the strongest is that individuals contaminated acciden-
tally in handling AIDs patients all test positive for HIV and most have succumbed
to the illness. Likewise, there was a direct correlation between AIDS and HIV in
blood products received by hemophiliacs. Moreover, the virus can be detected in
most or all AIDS patients and replicates in lymph nodes even if not found in the
blood stream. In support of Duesberg’s theories, Lawrence Broxmeyer and Alan
Cantwell claim that there is an association between acid-fast tuberculosis myco-
bacterium infection and AIDS. There is a high correlation between the incidence
of AIDS and tuberculosis in Third World countries, which might be the missing
co-factor preventing the curing of AIDS. Most of these ideas have been discred-
ited, but studies performed on hemophiliacs who are infected with HIV and those
who are not, show a high correlation between AIDS and AIDS-related opportu-
nistic infections. The belief in Duesberg’s theory has led to the deaths of HIV-
positive individuals who refused retrovirus therapy and to high rates of AIDS
deaths in South Africa, whose president, Thabo Mbeki, accepted Duesberg’s ideas.
President Mbeki and his health minister believed that HIV does not cause AIDS,
and that there is no such disease. Thus there was a belief that nothing needs to be
done. In 2003 the South African health minister advocated a diet of beetroot,
garlic, lemon juice and olive oil as protection against AIDS. In 2008 both Mbeki
and his health minister were forced to resign, and replaced by people who did
believe that HIV and AIDS were connected and should be treated with anti-
retroviral drugs. A group from Harvard has estimated that 365,000 people might
have been saved from premature death if they had been provided with medication,
particularly pregnant women. As a result of this denial, South Africa has one of the
highest incidences of HIV.
In a recent paper, Duesberg and his colleagues have challenged the statistics
used in the above-mentioned Harvard study, and claim that there has not been any
drop in the population growth of South Africa or other African countries, which
300
15
HIV and AIDS

would have been predicted if the disease had behaved as proposed by epidemi-
ologists [48]. However, Duesberg’s arguments do not take into account the unique
nature of HIV-1, the lengthy latent period before symptoms occur, and do not
discuss the case of hemophiliacs and others who advance to AIDS as a result of
accidental infection with HIV. In all fairness, I copy the abstract of Duesberg’s last
paper on the subject:
‘‘Since the discoveries of a putative AIDS virus in 1984 and of millions of
asymptomatic carriers in subsequent years, no general AIDS epidemic has
occurred by 2011. In 2008, however, it has been proposed that between 2000 and
2005 the new AIDS virus, now called HIV, had killed 1.8 million South Africans
at a steady rate of 300,000 per year and that anti-HIV drugs could have saved
330,000 of those. Here we investigate these claims in view of the paradoxes that
HIV would cause a general epidemic in Africa but not in other continents, and a
steady rather than a classical bell-shaped epidemic like all other new pathogenic
viruses. Surprisingly, we found that South Africa attributed only about 10,000
deaths per year to HIV between 2000 and 2005 and that the South African pop-
ulation had increased by 3 million between 2000 and 2005 at a steady rate of
500,000 per year. This gain was part of a monotonic growth trajectory spanning
from 29 million in 1980 to 49 million in 2008. During the same time Uganda
increased from 12 to 31 million, and Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole doubled from
400 to 800 million, despite high prevalence of HIV. We deduce from this
demographic evidence that HIV is not a new killer virus. Based on a review of the
known toxicities of antiretroviral drugs, we like to draw the attention of scientists,
who work in basic and clinical medical ﬁelds, including embryologists, to the need
of rethinking the risk-and-beneﬁt balance of antiretroviral drugs for pregnant
women, newborn babies and all others who carry antibodies against HIV’’.
It is true that the epidemic did not reach the number predicted by epidemiol-
ogists in the 1980s, at the outset of the disease. But this could be down to change in
sexual behavior, and the introduction of new medications that have allowed HIV
survivors to live longer, and testing which has possibly prevented the spread.
Admittedly there are unanswered questions, such as is our evidence of the origins
of the virus correct, and how much does certain life styles decrease life expectancy
and lead to other diseases.
15.22 The Virus
HIV belongs to the genus of viruses known as lentiviruses (Fig. 15.7) within the
genus of retroviruses. Examples of lentiviruses are:
Simian immunodeﬁciency virus—SIV
Feline immunodeﬁciency virus—FIV
Equine infectious anemia virus—EIAV
Visna/Maedi virus of sheep
Caprine (goat) encephalitis leukemia virus
15.21
Conspiracy Theories and AIDS Denial
301

The major characteristic of these viruses is the long period of latency before
infection in the animal is manifested.
HIV is taken up by the cell by the binding of the viral surface gp120/gp41 protein
to the CD4 protein (receptor) on the cell surface. This causes a conformational
change of the viral proteins, bringing it close to CCR5 or CXCR4 (chemokine
receptors) on the CD4 cells and thus allowing for fusion with cell membrane and
consequent uptake into the cell. Individuals with mutants in this chemokine receptor
gene are partially or fully resistant to HIV infection. Drugs have been developed to
interfere with virus uptake by binding to CCR5 or CXCR4.
15.23 Pathogenesis
After viral infection occurs, the infected individual may have ﬂu-like symptoms
within a few days for a short time. The cells infected are predominantly CD4-
helper lymphocytes or other cells with the CD4 receptor. Antibodies to the virus
are formed anywhere between 3 and 12 weeks after the initial infection. This is the
window period in which an individual does not know whether he/she is infected
and would test negative, using ELISA or Western blot. Eventually the virus will
destroy the CD4 lymphocytes, leading to immunodeﬁciency if treatment is not

initiated. However, the latent period may be very long (10 years) or very short
(6–8 weeks). As discussed previously testing for HIV measures the presence of
antibodies in the blood, or for viral nucleic acid.
Figures 15.8 and 15.9 represent the course of the infection over time. There is
a decrease in CD4 cells with the resulting onset of opportunistic infections and
death of the infected individual. Later in infection, with the drastic decrease in
CD4 cells, CD8 cells will also collapse. Below 200 CD4 cells per ml is con-
sidered AIDS and is usually accompanied by opportunistic infections. A large
number of different opportunistic infections may occur. Initially there are no real
symptoms, or minor ﬂu-like symptoms. This is accompanied by seroconversion

to antibody positive. Much later, there are changes in oral and skin conditions
with various diseases such as thrush and KS, and a generalized infection of the
lymph nodes may be obvious. The progression to AIDS can take as long as
10 years or more.

Phage Therapy and the Future
Abstract
Who really discovered bacteriophage? Ernest Hankin, a British scientist
working in India in the nineteenth century, claimed that the lack of bacterial
contamination in the Ganges River was due to the presence of anti-bacterial
substance. The idea of using phage to counteract bacterial infections was
promoted by Felix d’Herelle. In the 1930s there were large, successful clinical
trials in the U.S. using phage to counteract carbuncles and other infections. The
pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly advertised the sale of bacteriophage to
counteract various bacterial infections, mistakenly including herpes. Phage
therapy was accepted in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union from 1930 until
the 1950s, with phage being used to treat dysentery among soldiers in World
War II. There was a decline in its use with the collapse of the Soviet Union, but
phage therapy is actively being investigated as a treatment to prevent food
spoilage, and as a veterinary medicine, and the time is ripe to begin phage
therapy clinical trials in the West. There is renewed interest in phage therapy
because of the high risk of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.
16.1
Early Days of Phage Therapy
Were Frederick Twort and Felix d’Herelle really the ﬁrst to discover bacterio-
phage? There are reports from earlier sources indicating a similar discovery, but
without the isolation of the phage themselves. Ernest Hankin, a British microbi-
ologist, reported in 1896 that there was some anti-bacterial activity (anti-cholera)
in the waters of the Jamuna and Ganges Rivers in India. This substance was
ﬁlterable and heat-inactivated. His description of the conditions in the Ganges and
Jamuna make for interesting reading, with his descriptions of these rivers as being

cleaner than European or British rivers, despite the fact that people bathe in them,
throw corpses into them and defecate nearby [1].
‘‘Crossing the Ganga or the Jamuna that ﬂows through big Indian cities, when
one sees thousands of inhabitants washing themselves, their cattle and their clothes
in the dirty cloudy waters and one thinks of the half-burnt corpses that often have
their ﬁnal journey in the river, one could be excused for thinking that these waters
should be quite dangerous for consumption and that the worship of these sacred
rivers by the Hindus proves their ignorance of all idea of health and cleanliness.
The European authorities seem to think so, and as regards the spreading of
Cholera, they would like to consider that the Ganga is the main cause for trans-
mitting the disease in its country of origin, and the foster father of the microbe’’.
‘‘However, a simple microscopic examination of the waters of these two rivers
reveals a noticeable difference compared to the equally cloudy waters of European
rivers. The latter are found to have an abundance of plant and animal matter, a lot
of germs and living animal and plant forms. Water from the Ganga and Jamuna, on
the other hand, does not contain any trace of organic matter, unless it has been
collected from near a bathing ghat downstream from the city. The silt brought by
the river is almost exclusively formed of sand or mica. Bacteriological examina-
tion shows that microbes are much more scarce than those found in the major
rivers of Europe.’’
Most of the water ﬂowing into these rivers comes from the melting of snow
from the Himalayas. The corpses are in many cases burnt, and large turtles or
vultures eat those not burnt, very quickly. There is an increase in cholera bacteria
in the vicinity of the corpses, but it appears to clear quite quickly. Hankin rigor-
ously tested his ‘‘anti-bacterial’’ material, derived from the water of the river and
reported in the Annals of the Pasteur Institute that it had potent anti-bacterial
activity, however he could not identify it [1, 2]. We now assume that in fact he was
dealing with bacteriophage. Hankin went on to also propose the use of potassium
permanganate as a general antiseptic against bacteria in India, adding it to wells.
He showed that it had deﬁnite anti-cholera activity. While in India a few years ago
I was instructed only to eat ‘‘purple’’ salad. This is salad treated with permanga-
nate, primarily served in restaurants and prevents diarrhea in the non-immune
visitor. Thus although Hankin’s paper was written in 1898, the practice continues
until this day. The observations of Hankin are important in considering what came
later with the use of phage to ‘‘cure’’ epidemics of cholera.
Whether it was Twort or d’Herelle who ﬁrst discovered bacteriophage is
unimportant in the context of phage therapy, since there is no doubt that d’Herelle
championed this zealously, as discussed in Chap. 4. The ﬁrst actual case of phage
therapy was the treatment of a 12-year-old boy suffering from severe dysentery at
the Hôpital des Enfants-Malades in Paris in 1919. D’Herelle ﬁrst consumed a
phage preparation that he had prepared, as did some other colleagues, as a test of
toxicity (an early version of a phase 1 clinical trial!) before giving it to the patient.
The boy recovered within 24 h, and with this success, three other patients were
treated with a single phage preparation and recovered. The ﬁrst published report in
a scientiﬁc journal was one in which phage were used to treat staph infections of
310
16
Phage Therapy and the Future

the skin, by injection around the open wound, and again it was reported that the
infection cleared up within 24–48 h. There were many anecdotal cases, as well as
many studies published in reputable medical journals of phage therapy.
In 1919 d’Herelle used phage to treat individual cases of dysentery that were
brought to his attention at the Pasteur Institute, and all the cases were cured after
treatment. In order to prove that there was no danger, d’Herelle himself imbibed
doses of phage well above those administered in treatment. Other researchers soon
were trying phage therapy. Belgian researchers [3] reported the use of staphylo-
coccal phage to treat carbuncles with 1.5–2.0 cc of phage and reported that the
boils dried up within 24–48 h. This was done with only six patients and thus could
not be considered a clinical trial. In 1922, André Gratia of the Pasteur Institute in
Brussels, reported similar results. However, as expected, there were also failures.
The number of papers produced during this time in support of d’Herelle’s ideas
increased exponentially. In 1930 alone, there were 60 papers published on phage
therapy (reviewed in [4]).
16.2
U.S. Clinical Trials
A large and exciting clinical trial was performed at the Indiana University School of
Medicine and reported in the American Journal of Medical Sciences in 1930, [5].
This was a trial using ‘‘stock’’ bacteriophage—that is, a mixture of phage that could
lyse different strains of bacillus and staphylococcus. The physicians, headed by Dr.
Thurman Rice, treated approximately 300 patients who had carbuncles and open
wounds with phage preparation, in most cases applying the phage as a solution on
bandages or injecting or placing the phage in the vicinity of the wound. Of 66
children with severe carbuncles, 55 recovered (the lesions disappeared) within a few
days. This group applied phage to various types of infections with quite a bit of
success; even bedsores were treated with positive results. In untreated patients, or
controls in which one side of the face was treated with phage and the other with
mercurial ointment, the phage-treated side healed much faster. Ninety percent of all
the patients treated responded favorably to phage therapy, even though there were
expected complications in many cases from diabetes, syphilis and other conditions;
given these results, it is surprising that this method of treatment was not more
widespread. It is obvious from the report that the physicians were not quite certain of
how the effect was working, but were willing to go ahead with the treatment and there
was no report of side effects. This was in the days before drugs had to be approved by
the FDA and formal clinical trials were carried out. In general, streptococcus
infections were the most difﬁcult to treat and the success rate was much lower.
There is no doubt that there was some success with phage therapy in the case of
bubonic plague in India. D’Herelle was also asked to explore the use of phage to
treat cholera, and this was carried out in various parts of India. Some of the trials
considerably lowered the mortality from cholera, and in some cases recovery
seemed to be instantaneous. He stated that the oral administration of Vibrio cholera
phage could reduce the mortality rate from 62 to 8 % (quite an achievement) and
16.1

that the addition of phage to wells acted in a preventative fashion. Other trials were
not so successful, and may have been due to different strains of cholera, the wrong
phage, or to political upheavals occurring in India at the time. In looking at the data
objectively today, as presented by d’Herelle and others, there was a positive effect.
It is puzzling that this approach was not pursued further in more controlled clinical
trials. One of the criticisms offered against phage therapy was the lack of a control
population or placebo in the study. For moral reasons, in dealing with diseases such
as bubonic plague and cholera, there was no justiﬁcation for not treating a popu-
lation, when there really is no therapeutic alternative, and the disease is fatal in such
a short time. Placebos have not been used in many clinical trials in the U.S. in
diseases such as hepatitis C and HIV.
D’Herelle, as previously mentioned, set up a laboratory in Paris to produce
speciﬁc phage for speciﬁc illnesses, and a similar production line was started in the
U.S. in the 1940s at the Eli Lilly Company in Indianapolis. L’Oreal, the phar-
maceutical and cosmetic company, later bought out the French company. The
products were either cultures of lysed bacteria or water soluble gels (Table 10.1).
In the 1940s, the Eli Lilly Company (Indianapolis) produced seven phage
products for human use, including preparations targeting staphylococci, strepto-
cocci, Escherichia coli, and other bacterial pathogens. However, with the dis-
covery of antibiotics, these products were phased out in the U.S. In fact, many
commercial preparations were quite inactive, and in some cases thought to be
lacking quality control, which may be the reason that many trials were unsuc-
cessful. There was a great deal of variations within the commercial products, and
the most successful were those prepared ‘‘in the laboratory,’’ where the action of
the phage could be tested on speciﬁc strains of bacteria. In fact, these commercial
products were hyped and advertised against herpes and other viral diseases—on
which, of course, there would be no effect.
16.3
Phage Therapy Between 1920 and 1940
Between 1920 and 1940 there were hundreds of publications on the treatment of
speciﬁc diseases with phage therapy. Most of them were reported in non-English
publications, and thus not available to American and British physicians or scien-
tists. Many cases were successful, but many were equally unsuccessful, or doubtful.

Phage Therapy and the Future

In fact, some researchers found that they could not repeat their own work. In the
case of cholera, there seemed to be more success than failure, since some studies
were performed in a large area and in large populations of India the results and
methods used have been questioned. In the case of both cholera and dysentery, the
infecting organism is conﬁned to the lumen of the intestine, and phage can be taken
orally, although it may be necessary to take it with a basic substance to counteract
the acidity of the stomach and digestive tract. Many of the papers reported mixed
results with dysentery and with typhoid fever; a vaccine for the latter is probably
more effective than phage therapy.
A more positive note can be detected in the results of the treatment of boils and
carbuncles. Here the success rate is as high as 80 % in many cases, both in the U.S.
and in France; even eye sties have been successfully treated. However, as in other
studies, other physicians have reported less of an effect, and one is left wondering
whether this is due to variations in the phage preparations or to the lack of pre-
testing to determine whether the phage were really active and speciﬁc for that
particular bacterium. One physician had treated 24 cases of neonatal impetigo (a
staph infection), and treated the disease with subcutaneous injections, resulting in a
cure in 24–48 h in every case, depending on the stage of the sores. Phage were also
used in the treatment of peritonitis, and in surgery for ruptured appendicitis. The
mortality rate after this type of surgery was reduced by 50 %, and in fact, one of
the surgeons of this period (Tsouloukudzi in France) described phage therapy as the
greatest discovery in medicine. However, despite the hundreds of papers, one is left
with the feeling that there was doubt as to whether this was a practice with potential
(these studies have recently been reviewed in [4]). All reviews of the period insist
that phage therapy needs more study, and it is puzzling why this attitude persisted in
the West (in the U.S., and in France, to a lesser extent), and not in eastern Europe.
To quote a concluding paragraph from a 1933 paper by Janet Stout [6]: ‘‘This
mysterious agent has very reluctantly yielded up its secrets and no man can say
what the future will reveal, but the possibilities are inﬁnite. Even though bacte-
riophage therapy is still in its infancy, its value even now is ﬁrmly established in
the treatment of diseases with which we are confronted daily’’.
There does not appear to have been a comprehensive plan to test this new
therapy with a control population in the way that antibiotics were tested a few
years later. Could this be because the commercial importance of phage therapy
was not realized or that there was no commercial value in phage? Could the
individual strains be patented? Most such strains of phage would be in the public
domain unless engineered by the company, something that would not happen until
the twenty-ﬁrst century.
16.4
Phage Therapy in the 1960s
Nevertheless, phages continued to be used therapeutically, together with, or
instead of antibiotics in eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union. Phage
therapy was part of the standard care in the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s,
16.3
Phage Therapy Between 1920 and 1940

even when antibiotics were available. Several institutions were actively involved
in therapeutic phage research and production, with activities centered at the Eliava
Institute of Bacteriophage in Tbilisi, Georgia, and the Hirszfeld Institute of
Immunology and Experimental Therapy (HIIET) of the Polish Academy of Sci-
ences in Wroclaw (Breslau), Poland. Hundreds of papers have been published, all
extolling the success of phage therapy in the Soviet Union and in Poland and other
countries of eastern Europe, and it would take a complete book to describe all
these trials. Much of this has been reviewed in Thomas Hausler’s Viruses vs
Superbugs [7] (and in the mini review of Sulakvelidze [2001]) [8]. This paper lists
the major human phage therapy studies performed within recent years in Poland
and the Former Soviet Union.
The Eliava Institute at one time employed 1,200 people and supplied phage
preparations (cocktails of mixed phage) to the Soviet Army and to hospitals all
over the Soviet Union. Work at the institute reached its peak in the 1980s, when it
produced two tons of phage products twice a week, 80 % of it for the Soviet
military—a market it lost, along with its high status under the Soviet Ministry of
Health, with the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the institute went through hard
times and was basically disbanded and abandoned. It has only very recently been
revitalized with new trials of phage therapy, both in the West as well as in the East.
The Georgian Academy of Sciences, and later the Georgian Ministry of Education
and Science, manage the institute. It once more does research, some of it supported
by the U.S.
The Ludwig Hirszfeld Institute in Wroclaw, Poland, was founded in 1945, and
named for the microbiologist Ludwig Hirszfeld, a physician who had worked on
blood groups and anaphylaxis, and was one of the discoverers of the ABO blood
groups. He was also involved in testing pregnancy for incompatibility through
differences in blood groups (Rh factor). In 1945 he became director of the Institute
for Medical Microbiology in Wrocław and dean of the medical faculty. He taught
at the institute, now afﬁliated with the Polish Academy of Sciences and named
after him, until his death in 1954 at age 69.
A major study of the effect of phage therapy in Poland was published in 1987
[9]. This was a report on the treatment of 550 cases of septicemia (what used to be
called ‘‘blood poisoning’’) patients, the majority of whom were antibiotic-resistant.
These patients ranged in age from 1 week to 86 years, and the treatment was
performed at various clinics. The bacterial infections included E. coli, Staphylo-
coccus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella and Salmonella, and lytic phages were ﬁrst
selected for the appropriate organism from a collection of 250 lytic phages. The
patients were either given phage orally (after neutralizing stomach acid), by
applying phage-containing dressing on the wounds, or by applying it to the eye, ear
or nasal mucosa as needed. If phage resistance developed, other phage were used.
The duration of treatment was 1–16 weeks, depending on the response. The suc-
cess rates were an astounding 92 % overall, and 94 % in the antibiotic-resistant
patients. A large number of similar studies were carried out in the Soviet Union.

Phage Therapy and the Future

Most of these did not have placebo controls, since the methodology was accepted
as being well tried and successful. An excellent review of all the trials, mostly in
the Soviet Union, has recently been published [4].
16.5
Phage Therapy Today
In order to be accepted into medical practice in the U.S., it is essential to carry out
pre-clinical trials in animals. For most anti-cancer drugs, preliminary experiments
are done on experimental tumors in mice and in rats, although occasionally other
animal models are used. One advantage of phage therapy is that it may also have
veterinary use, and this may be of commercial importance and allow for start-up
companies to test its efﬁcacy before being tried on human subjects. Successful
experiments have been performed on mice, calves, piglets and sheep, using a
mixture of coli phage against E. coli pathogenic strains in these animals in the
U.K. This particular strain of E. coli causes severe diarrhea in calves and other
farm animals. In fact, the authors [10] state that the phage treatment was much
more effective than treatment with a series of antibiotics used as controls. Only
streptomycin gave similar results. In some cases, resistant strains of E. coli
developed but did not interfere with recovery. Phage were maintained in the
environment for some time, in the stalls or bedding, and infected other calves and
cured them from a similar infection. Moreover, Smith observed [10], as did
d’Herelle 60 years earlier, that some calves appeared to be protected from this
strain of E.coli. On examination, these calves contained a bacteriophage different
from the one used in treatment and kept the bacterial infection under control.
These experiments [10] were done with controls, and have been reviewed by
others and stimulated a new interest in phage therapy in the West.
It is interesting that the toxin produced by the pathogenic strain of E. coli
O157:H15 itself appears to be the result of the presence of two lysogenic phage in
E. coli, yet despite this, the strain could be lysed by other phage isolated from
cultures.
16.6
Phage as an Alternative to Antibiotics
One of the major concerns of environmentalists in the U.S. (as well as in the U.K.)
is the use of large amounts of antibiotics in animal food that is fed to cattle and
chickens. The use of such antibiotics has also led to the development of antibiotic-
resistant strains of bacteria. At the same time, there have been outbreaks of sal-
monella poisoning (sometimes lethal) from the digestion of meat, particularly
‘‘rare hamburgers,’’ and even from vegetables that have become contaminated
with pathogenic E. coli and salmonella. The E. coli variant is known as 0157:H7
and causes what has been termed ‘‘hamburger disease.’’ In some people, especially
children between the ages of 1 and 10, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) can
16.4
Phage Therapy in the 1960s
315

result from infection by E. coli O157:H7 and can lead to kidney failure and death.
A child may become infected after consuming contaminated food or beverages,
such as meat, especially undercooked ground beef; unpasteurized juices; con-
taminated water; or through contact with an infected person. In 2010 there were
outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 due to contaminated cheese in some western states
of the U.S., shredded romaine lettuce in some central and eastern states, and beef
nationally from National Steak and Poultry. The CDC estimates that roughly one
in six Americans becomes sick from food-borne diseases each year. Among
bacterial pathogens, salmonella serotype enteritis accounted for the largest number
of outbreaks and outbreak-related cases, and the largest number of deaths, fol-
lowed by Listeria monocytogenes. The availability of a cocktail of phage would be
very useful not only in treating these cases, but also in applying it to the possibly
contaminated foodstuffs itself [11, 12].
Klebsiella pneumonia is another bacteria that can cause pneumonia in the
immunocompromised individual and occurs quite frequently as a hospital-acquired
disease. Klebsiella is a normal part of the human ﬂora and not normally patho-
genic. Recent experiments performed in Russia show that phage are very efﬁcient
at curing experimental infections in mice and guinea pigs when administered
either nasally or by injection. There was no toxicity in the animals. This was
followed in 1992 by a test in humans, in which 109 patients infected with Kleb-
siella were treated with a phage cocktail against different strains of the bacterium.
Again, the phage preparations were non-toxic and appeared to be effective.
Another use for phage therapy is in the treatment of burns, which are a large
problem both in total numbers of cases and severity, particularly in times of war
and after terrorist attacks. Infection remains the leading cause of death among
patients who are hospitalized for burns. Treatment with phage both in humans in
the Soviet Union or, more recently, at the Tiblisi Institute, has met with remarkable
success. ‘‘Three woodsmen in the mountains of Georgia stumbled upon a pair of
canisters that were, oddly, hot to the touch. Then men lugged the objects back to
their campsite to warm themselves on a bitterly cold night. That turned out to be a
terrible mistake: the canisters, Soviet relics once used to power remote generators,
were intensely radioactive and burned two of the men severely. The victims were
rushed to the capital, Tbilisi, where doctors plied them with antibiotics but failed
to prevent Staphylococcus bacteria from invading the deep wounds. Septic shock
seemed just around the corner’’ [13]. Georgian physicians treated the wounds with
bandages impregnated with anti-staph phage and within a short time the wounds
healed. The phage products from the Eliava Institute are now being marketed
worldwide.
As in all cases of medicine and drug development, it is important that the right
phage be picked for the correct target. One has to avoid phage that may undergo
lysogeny, or may even introduce toxic genes into the bacteria, increasing its
pathogenicity rather than killing the bacteria. A new approach in selecting phage
may be necessary and include the sequencing of the DNA to identify any toxic
genes, or genes involved in integration. This can now be done routinely and quite
cheaply with the advent of fast throughput DNA sequencing. RNA phage may also
316
16
Phage Therapy and the Future

be used effectively, and here there is less danger of integration into the bacterial
chromosome.
As in the case of antibiotics, phage resistance will occur. In fact, this was one of
the factors used in the 1950s to discourage further experiments with phage therapy.
However, the rate of mutation to resistance to phage is about 100 times lower than
that of resistance to antibiotics. Using a cocktail of phage with binding to different
receptors on the bacterial host should prevent the development of drug resistance.
This has been the approach taken in treating HIV and AIDS, where a cocktail of
drugs prevents the selection for drug resistance.
16.7
Conclusions
It is now almost 100 years since the discovery of bacteriophage, and about the
same time since d’Herelle proposed using phage to treat bacterial infections. The
experience of many physicians from the 1930s to 1940s—before the advent of
antibiotics—suggests that this treatment works, once the speciﬁc phage for any
speciﬁc strain of bacterium has been identiﬁed. Using genetic engineering tech-
nology and selection, it should be possible to engineer phage with broad-spectrum
or a narrow-spectrum, depending on the need. There are obviously three major
hurdles to development: one is to overcome resistance of the host bacterium; the
second to outwit the restriction enzymes of the host if active against the phage and
the third to create a government regulatory approval system for clinical trials, since
the current FDA regulations do not apply to ‘‘living biologicals.’’ An alternative
approach is to treat phage in a manner similar to a vaccine, where live agents may
be used, e.g., the attenuated polio vaccine.
One subject that has to be addressed is the reason for the skepticism in the West
as a result of the mixed results of the 1930s. This appears to have been due to
many factors, not least of all the hype by commercial companies on using phage to
cure diseases such as herpes and other viruses, the presence of toxins and con-
taminations in the preparations, and the lack of speciﬁcity of the phage towards the
disease being treated. Another non-scientiﬁc reason may have been the objections
to using a method developed in the Soviet Union, although the U.S. was willing to
accept the Soviet space program as a competitor. In order to meet U.S. and
European standards, it will be necessary to purify the phage, using most recent
advanced technology to remove bacterial debris, to select appropriate phage for
each strain of bacterium, and to determine efﬁcacy before use. Such phage can
be maintained at speciﬁc centers, such as the American Type Culture Collection
or medical centers and would be available as needed, very much on the model
originally developed in Tbilisi, Georgia. It would also be more efﬁcient to use a
mixture of phage against different organisms (cocktail), as has been developed at
the Eliava Institute. Since commercial biotech companies are interested in patents
and proﬁt, it will be necessary to patent modiﬁcations made to the phage, as well
as combinations with antibiotics, and perhaps even methods of application.
16.6
Phage as an Alternative to Antibiotics
317

One of the major problems facing the medical establishment, and of course the
general population, is the increase in multi-drug-resistant strains of bacteria. These
have arisen from the uncontrolled use of antibiotics. It was estimated that in 2005
there were 100,000 serious cases of multidrug-resistant staph infections in the
U.S., resulting in some 20,000 deaths. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
now estimates that as many as 80,000 hospital patients are infected with antibiotic
resistant S. aureus every year. Also blood poisoning (sepsis) occurs in the U.S. at
the annual rate of 750,000 individuals, resulting in 210,000 deaths. Since the
problem of antibiotic resistance is getting worse (many cases of tuberculosis are
drug-resistant), alternatives to antibiotics are a must, and phage therapy would
seem to offer such an alternative. Because drug companies are loath to do research
on new antibiotics, it is likely that they will be even more loath to do research on
phage, which may not be patentable. Evidence indicates that in many cases, a
combination of phage and antibiotics (in the case of non-antibiotic resistant bugs)
is much more effective than either treatment alone. Although there were successful
trials carried out in 1959 against staph infections in the U.S., applying phage by
different routes, and 80 % of the patients recovered, the staph phage lysate was
suspended by the FDA in 1990. The reasons for the withdrawal of license are not
clear.
During the last 3 years (2008–2011), phage preparations against secondary
infections in cystic ﬁbrosis patients were used. In these patients, mucus accumu-
lates in the lungs, causing difﬁculty in breathing. The application of phage
decreases the bacterial count in the lungs, the patients appeared to be healthier, and
there were longer periods between rounds of bacterial infection. Small-scale
experiments have recently been carried out in the Burns Center of the Queen
Astrid Hospital in Brussels, Belgium. This was a ‘‘phase 1’’ trial, with no adverse
effects. Another small-scale trial carried out by a private company, Biocontrol Ltd.
in London, on 24 volunteers with chronic ear infections, showed no adverse
effects, and recovery from the conditions for some time. Thus a beginning is being
made in the west. Biocontrol has recently merged with Targeted Genetics to form a
new company, AmpliPhi Biosciences, which has applied for a U.S. patent to cover
the use of phage to treat bioﬁlms of a Pseudomanas aerogenosa in combination
with antibiotics. According to the patent, ‘‘Examples of speciﬁc treatment regi-
mens covered include the treatment of human and animal infections resulting from
a skin burn or skin wound, a lung infection, an eye, ear or urinary infection or an
infection associated with a medical device or implant.’’
In dealing with a treatment such as bacteriophage or even viral oncolysis,
discussed later, the rules developed by the FDA for single chemical elements may
have to be changed. This was done in initial trials with gene therapy, and a
mechanism may exist for approval of such trials by special boards. The evidence
that phage therapy works in certain bacterial diseases, such as staph infections, and
perhaps in cholera, is quite overwhelming and it is surprising that this method-
ology is not used much more in the U.S. and Western Europe. With the problem of
multidrug resistance in the last few years, we are seeing new biotech companies
arising
that are developing phage therapeutics. According to the Phage

Phage Therapy and the Future

International Web site, which promotes and advertises phage therapy, there are at
least a dozen companies involved in developing phage therapy, including two
using the phage collection at the Eliava Institute in Georgia. In the U.S., Intralytex,
a company in Maryland, has received grants from the USDA and from the U.S.
Army to develop phage therapy, using phage as a probiotic against shigella
infection among soldiers, and also using phage to prevent food-borne diseases such
as salmonella and pseudomonas. Another company involved is Gangagen, which
is producing phage and phage products (lysins) against drug-resistant Staphylo-
coccus auries. Even a company as large as the Nestlé food corporation has become
involved in testing phage against pathogenic strains of E. coli and it is currently
recruiting patients in Bangladesh and other developing countries using phage in
the treatment of childhood diarrhea.
Thus, there are all the indications that phage therapy will be the alternative to
antibiotics in the treatment of some diseases and in treating antibiotic-resistant
bacteria.

Viral Oncolysis or Virotherapy
Abstract
The concept of using a virus to ‘‘kill’’ a tumor dates back to the beginning of the
1990’s when it was noticed that occasionally a tumor would shrink following a
viral infection. This concept was tested from the 1950s until the 1970s in
animal models, and in a few human trials. Success was limited and the practice
of viral oncolysis, or ‘‘virotherapy,’’ was met with skepticism. Renewed interest
arose following the development of recombinant DNA technology. Recombi-
nant adenovirus and herpesvirus were explored as anticancer agents. Initial
efforts to develop their use was delayed due to the death of a patient. New
vectors were produced in the 1990s using various viruses, engineered to bind
preferentially to tumor cells. Some of these viruses contain transgenes coding
for proteins that stimulate the immune system. Within the last few years,
clinical trials using various genetically engineered viruses have been initiated.
There have not been any toxic side effects, although long-term data are still not
available. Preliminary data from a construct of herpes simplex 1 carrying the
gene for GCSF shows a positive response against melanoma. A number of
biotech companies are now involved in virotherapy; thus, one can conclude that
the future of virotherapy as a major tool for the treatment of cancer looks
promising.
17.1
A Short History of Viral Oncolysis
‘‘Viral oncolysis’’, or ‘‘virotherapy’’ as it is known today, is a concept that
developed at the turn of the twentieth century with the observations that occa-
sionally, cancer regressed following a viral infection [1, 2]. This led to a very
simple idea: that viruses might be able to target cancer cells, a magic bullet that
would destroy the tumor but leave surrounding cells intact. Throughout the 1930s
and 1950s, attempts were made to treat cancers in animal models and humans with

viruses, but with limited or little success [3–5]. A critical review of the progress in
the ﬁeld ended in a very pessimistic tone, [4] leading to skepticism in the scientiﬁc
community and lack of funding from government agencies.
As an example, in the 1970s I discovered that a picornavirus (bovine entero-
virus), when injected directly into transplantable tumors of mice, triggered tumor
regression [6, 7]. However, this research never reached the clinic because of
skepticism, and, in turn, lack of funding from government agencies. This continued
to be the pattern until the late 1990s, when interest in virotherapy was rekindled,
concurrent with advances in gene therapy and the development of viral vectors
containing transgenes (genes not usually found in that virus or vector). The pro-
gression of this interest can be seen in a graph plotting the number of papers
containing the words ‘‘virotherapy’’ or ‘‘viral oncolysis’’ in their titles or abstracts,
versus time (Fig. 17.1a, b).
The ability to engineer viral vectors completely changed the world of viro-
therapy: The attachment of the virus to host results in the uptake of the virus
through the cell membrane by endocytosis, and the ultimate un-coating of the virus
leads to virus gene expression that may result in cell lysis. The ﬁrst step of this
process requires recognition between proteins of the virus coat or their appendages
and protein domains (receptors) on the surface membrane of the host cells. Through
genetic engineering, the virus genome is altered so that it codes for proteins that
bind selectively to receptor domains of the tumor cells in preference to domains of
other host cells. In addition, the viral genome can be engineered, so that it codes for
proteins that bind to and activate extracellular molecular complexes, leading to
additional enhancement of virus-cell interaction. It is possible to introduce genes so
that they activate speciﬁc components of the immune system in the tumor envi-
ronment, and unique promoters can be placed in front of viral genes or in front of
the transgenes to enhance their expression in the tumor cell environment [8].
Two viruses were initially of heightened interest: adenovirus-5 and herpes
simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). Adenoviruses, both in a replicative form and non-rep-
licative form, can incorporate foreign genes into their DNA. HSV-1 can be
manipulated so that it targets tumor cells, and because of its large size, incorpo-
rates non-viral genes toxic to tumors. A large number of such vectors have been
constructed and successfully tested in clinical trials (Table 17.1).
A positive feature that impelled virotherapy forward was the establishment of
biotech companies whose goal is to construct and test novel viral vectors—initially
for gene therapy and later as anti-cancer agents. Many of the vectors constructed
by these companies and in academic laboratories are in phase I and phase II
clinical trials. One, talimogene laherparepvec (OncoVEXGM-CSF), is currently in
phase III trial of stage-3 and stage-4 melanoma. Phase I examines the toxicity or
tolerance to the treatment; phase II tests the therapeutic efﬁcacy in a small number
of patients; and phase III is a large-scale test of both therapeutic efﬁcacy and
tolerability.
Table 17.1 lists the viruses that are currently being tested as anti-cancer agents
in clinical trials.

Adenovirus
Adenovirus (Ad-5) is a preferred tool in gene therapy research. In humans, ade-
noviruses cause mild respiratory illness in infants but are harmless in healthy
adults. In hamsters, some human adenoviruses are tumorigenic. The viral repli-
cation cycle is divided into the two phases, early-gene and late-gene expression.
Deletions of the early genes, such as E1 and E2, prevent viral replication, and such
deletions are used in the construction of non-replicating adenovirus vectors

containing a transgene. Deletion of the E3 gene does not affect viral replication,
and is the most common site to insert transgenes. However, deletion of the E3
region does affect the immune response to the virus. Replication-competent viruses
are preferred in virotherapy, since theoretically the virus should lyse the tumor
cells and destroy them. This is in contrast to vectors for gene therapy where one
would prefer a non-replicating virus (see Chap. 18).
Unfortunately, gene therapy experiments with adenovirus were temporarily
halted in 1999 because of a tragic accident in an 18-year-old patient, Jesse Gel-
singer, who was diagnosed with ornithine carboxylase (OTC) deﬁciency; an
apparent overdose of the adenovirus containing the OTC gene resulted in his
death. All human experimentation with adenovirus vectors was stopped for a
number of years until safety could be improved. However, researchers continued
to engineer the virus.
A series of phase I and II clinical trials were performed with the adenovirus
Onyx-015, the ﬁrst virus speciﬁcally engineered to destroy tumor cells defective in
the tumor suppressor gene p53 [10, 11]. The virus was not toxic and inhibited
tumor growth. Onyx-015 was developed on the hypothesis that adenovirus, con-
taining a mutation in the E1b gene, would only replicate in tumor cells with a
mutation in the p53 gene. This is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits tumor
formation by regulating the cell cycle, controlling DNA synthesis and cell repli-
cation. p53 protein monitors DNA damage and induces cell death (apoptosis).
Deletions or mutations of p53 occur frequently in human tumors, often making
them resistant to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In normal cells, the presence
of p53 would prevent the mutated virus from replicating, since the interaction of
p53 and E1b is essential for viral replication.
Onyx-015 was extensively tested on tumor cell lines, and efﬁciently infected
tumors containing a mutated or inactivated p53, but not normal cells, or tumors
containing wild-type p53. It replicated in p53-deﬁcient cells as rapidly as wild-
type virus. Similar results were obtained in human tumors transplanted into nude
mice. Since adenovirus in general does not replicate in mice, in these experiments
it was impossible to examine the immune response to the virus. There were two
problems with this system: the virus had to be injected directly into the tumor, and
its effect on metastasis could not be measured. Later experiments indicated that
this conditionally defective virus could replicate in the presence of p53, although
not to the same extent as in p53-deﬁcient tumors (Fig. 17.2).
Onyx-015 was administered to over 250 cancer patients in approximately 15
clinical trials. There was some limited tumor regression in head and neck cancers;
however, the viral treatment was augmented with either chemotherapy or radiation
therapy. The virus was not powerful enough to spread to metastatic lesions or
completely eliminate the primary tumor. This was a great disappointment, and
brought experiments with Onyx-015 to a halt in the U.S. In part, this was due to a
lack of funding for further work, and led to the sale of the patent and the virus to
Shanghai Sunway Biotech of China.
17.2
Adenovirus
325

A modiﬁed virus, adenovirus H101—similar to Onyx-015—was approved by
the State Food and Drug Administration of China for use in combination with
chemotherapy in the treatment of late-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma and head
and neck cancers. H101 was tested without side effects in phase I and phase II
trials in China, also in combination with chemotherapy. In a large phase III trial of
head and neck cancers with 160 patients at 13 hospitals, there was a 79 %
remission rate when the virus was used with chemotherapy against a 40 % rate of
remission with chemotherapy alone. This strain of adenovirus (oncorine) was
ofﬁcially approved for clinical use in China in 2005 and is now used in treating
many different types of cancer. A second adenovirus containing the p53 gene has
also been tested and approved.

Adenovirus Plus GM-CSF
An important landmark in viral cancer treatment has been the incorporation of
‘‘granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor’’ (GM-CSF) as a component
of the virus. GM-CSF activates T-cells and dendritic cells against tumor antigens
and stimulates dendritic cells to produce interferon-gamma [12]. The GM-CSF
gene has been incorporated into the genome of the larger DNA viruses such as
adenovirus, HSV-1 and vaccinia. Adenovirus (CG0070) with GM-CSF is currently
being tested on bladder cancer in patients whose BCG treatment has not been
successful. This is a phase II/III trial, which will not be completed until 2019; the
phase I trial showed no adverse effects [13]. Various doses of adenovirus were
tested, and toxic levels were not reached. Patients received either single or mul-
tiple doses of the virus at levels of 1 9 1012–1 9 1013 or 3 9 1013 viral particles,
and viral replication was detected in all patients. The response rate in patients
receiving multiple injections of CG0070 was 63.6 %. In this particular trial, the
presence of GM-CSF had a profound effect on the response.
Almost all humans have antibodies to adenovirus-5, or will develop antibodies
during treatment, an immune response that may reduce or inhibit the effect of
multiple doses of the oncolytic virus. To avoid inhibition by anti-bodies, chimeric
adenoviruses have been constructed [14]. Using a chimera of adenovirus 5/3 and a
transgene for GM-CSF, a Finnish group [14] demonstrated both an oncolytic effect
of the virus and an enhanced immune response against the tumor in several groups
of patients. In 115 patients treated with CGTG-102 (Ad5/3-D24-GMCSF), median
overall survival was 111 days following single and 277 days after serial treatment
in non-randomized comparison. Using different adenovirus or chimeric viruses had
no adverse effects.
Despite this initial success, there are still problems with the adenovirus system.
These include the slow rate of virus replication; the inability of the virus to spread to
other cancer sites (although this is helped by adding immune-stimulants as
transgenes to the virus as discussed above); and the possibility that virus is inhibited
by the host immune response. There is also the need for the virus receptor to be
expressed on the tumor cell surface, which does not happen in all cancers. Viruses
have also been engineered so that they recognize novel sites on the tumor. To
summarize, many different adenovirus vectors have been produced with modiﬁ-
cations of receptor proteins, unique promoters and insertion of genes that stimulate
the immune system. The number of modiﬁed adenoviruses are too numerous to
discuss in such a review, and this ﬁeld has been reviewed extensively [15].
17.4
Herpes Viral Vectors
Herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1) is associated with cold sores in the mouth (see Chap.
14). A number of features make HSV-1 an attractive vector for virotherapy. These
are:
17.3
Adenovirus Plus GM-CSF
327

1. Despite its tendency to infect predominantly neural tissue, HSV-1 has a very
wide cellular host range, infecting non-dividing as well as dividing cells, and
expresses exogenous genes inserted into its DNA with excellent efﬁciency.
2. Large segments of HSV DNA can be deleted and replaced by genes for drugs or
other anti-cancer agents in both replication-competent and replication-defective
HSV-1 mutants, allowing for simultaneous delivery of multiple transgenes with
different promoters.
3. The HSV-1 genome does not integrate into the cellular DNA, eliminating the
possibility of insertional mutagenesis.
4. Recombinant HSV-1 can be readily constructed, and puriﬁed stocks of virus
containing 1010 infectious particles per millilitre can be prepared routinely
without contamination of wild-type virus.
5. The large size of the virus facilitates the insertion of multiple genes.
6. Evidence would suggest that the replication of herpesvirus in tumor cells is
more efﬁcient than adenovirus vectors.
7. Non-replicating herpesviruses can be used as carriers of anti-cancer drugs or
pro-drugs, since enzymes that transform non-toxic compounds to toxic com-
pounds are coded for by the cell or virus.
HSV1716 was ﬁrst constructed as a non-neurotropic deletion mutant of wild-
type HSV-1[16]. This virus was no longer neurotropic but grew in other cell types.
It could enter a latent stage but was defective in activation [17]. It was ﬁrst tested
in human neuronal tumors in vitro and in mice [18, 19] and later in brain tumors in
mice with an oncolytic effect, destroying only the tumor cells and not the sur-
rounding cells [20]. A large number of laboratory studies had concluded that HSV
1716 (by now called ICP34.5 deletion) could be useful in the treatment of brain
tumors. Furthermore, results of animal studies demonstrated that HSV 1716 was
oncolytic for a variety of human tumors growing in mice, including mesothelio-
mas, melanomas, and ovarian cancer. The ﬁrst phase I trial of HSV1716 was
performed in Britain with patients who had a relapsed malignant glioma. Of nine
patients treated, four had recovered after 14–24 months [21]. Similar results were
found with melanoma [22].
A British biotech company, Biovex, developed a second generation of
HSV1716 with the incorporation of the cytokine gene (GM-CSF) granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor [23]. Thus not only was this virus oncolytic,
it also stimulated the immune system to destroy remaining cancer cells. A phase II
trial reported a 28 % objective positive response in 2009. Meanwhile, Biovex was
bought by the American biotech giant, Amgen. A phase III trial was initiated with
advanced melanoma patients. This virus, about which one will hear much in the
future, is now known as ‘‘T-vec’’ or ‘‘talimogene.’’ The preliminary results of the
phase III trial have recently been reported. The data show a 16 % durable response
rate—compared to only 2 % for the GM-CSF arm of the study—with a 26 %
overall response rate (6 % for GM-CSF). Four hundred patients were recruited for
this trial. There is a possibility that this vector will be used in the future to treat
many types of cancers, and the study will be completed in 2014. Brain tumors are

untreatable, so that successful experiments will be a breakthrough in cancer
therapy (Fig. 17.3).
The strain of HSV-1 currently used in clinical trials in Japan is HF10, a
spontaneous deletion mutant of the virus, which is replication-competent but less
pathogenic than wild-type, and it has been used to treat breast and pancreatic
cancer [24]. In cases where two nodules of breast cancer were injected at the same
time, one with saline and one with the virus, the tumor regressed in response to the
virus and not to the saline. Preliminary results have been very favorable. A second-
generation construct has been built to incorporate the IL12 cytokine gene, which
activates naïve T-cells and turns them into T-helper cells; in addition, it stimulates
interferon production and activation of NK (natural killer) cells. This construct has
worked very well in a murine glioblastoma model with an enhanced immune
response leading to destruction of tumor stem cells. A large phase I trial is cur-
rently under way with this vector for the treatment of head and neck cancers and
melanoma.
17.5
Vaccinia Virus
If one were searching for an oncolytic virus, vaccinia would be an obvious choice.
The virus has been used as a vaccine for years with few side effects and is very
lytic in culture. It contains a large amount of DNA, some of which is expendable,
and can be replaced by transgenes, or pro-drug genes. As in the case of herpes
virus, vaccinia virus thymidine kinase mutants, which only replicated in tumor

cells, have been isolated [25]. This virus has been tested in phase I studies in
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, [26] but an announcement in September
2013 indicated that the phase II trial of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with this
virus did not meet its end point (survival) in late-stage liver cancer.
As already discussed for adenovirus, one of the problems with viral oncolysis is
the need to repeatedly administer the same virus. This problem has been cir-
cumvented by using more than one virus. In a study of cervical carcinoma, both
Semiliki Forest Virus and vaccinia virus, which boosted the immune response,
[27] were used. A clinical trial with JX594, a thymidine kinase negative, GM-CSF-
carrying vaccinia virus, has enrolled 129 patients and is currently under way, but
results will not be known until November 2014. This same vector has been suc-
cessfully used in another phase II trial, in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
patients, demonstrating a statistically signiﬁcant dose dependent on overall sur-
vival beneﬁt with 14.1 months’ median overall survival for the high-dose group
compared to 6.7 months for a low dose group (p value 0.02) [28]. This virus is now
being used to treat colon and pancreatic cancer.
17.6
Poliovirus
Another virus that has come to the forefront in oncolytic trials is a modiﬁed
poliovirus isolated from experiments in which poliovirus was created in a cell-free
system [29]. This virus was oncolytic for neuroblastoma cells in mice sensitive to
poliovirus. The oncolytic effect appeared to be due to the enhancement of T-cell
activity and took place even in the presence of polio antibodies.
A second approach is to make poliovirus less neuropathic by engineering in
rhinovirus (common cold virus) sequences. Glioblastoma has a high number of
polio receptors, a characteristic of many tumors. Although not yet at phase I
clinical testing, physicians at Duke University used the virus in June 2013 and may
have saved the life of a young woman with a brain tumor, which had reoccurred
after surgery. The 22-year-old patient appears to have recovered and she would be
one of the ﬁrst patients with a brain tumor to be successfully treated with a virus.
Other cancers that have proven to be untreatable by chemotherapy or radiation
therapy, such as neuroblastomas and glioblastomas, are now being treated in
model systems with a genetically altered recombinant poliovirus. PVSRIPO is a
recombinant virus derived from the live attenuated, oral (SABIN) serotype 1
poliovirus (PV) vaccine. It contains a heterologous internal ribosomal entry site
(IRES) from human rhinovirus type 2 (HRV2). PVSRIPO recognizes Necl-5, a
cancer-related cell adhesion molecule and tumor antigen widely expressed in
malignancies such as glioblastoma [30]. (Details on the clinical trial can be found
at http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01491893.) The virus will be injected directly
into the tumor, and results are expected in 2015–2016.

Viral Oncolysis or Virotherapy

17.7
Other Viruses
Measles virus is another virus that has been engineered in the treatment of tumors.
It has been claimed to have a very wide host range active against mesothelioma
(lung tumors caused by exposure to asbestos), lymphomas, glioblastomas, prostate
and many others. Part of the viral therapy effect is due to enhancement of the
immune system, with an increase in CD8 T-cells. A phase I trial of the Edmonston
(vaccine) strain of measles virus, with or without cyclophosphamide, an anti-
cancer compound, in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma, is
under way.
One of the major problems in treating cancers is destroying secondary tumors
that have spread as a result of metastasis. Unfortunately, clinical trials with ade-
novirus suggested that this was not possible. The use of adenovirus as an oncolytic
agent may in fact have inhibited this ﬁeld of research, since it did not spread
systemically to other sites. Other viruses have the ability to spread to and destroy
metastatic lesions. In particular, this has been true of Newcastle disease virus
(NDV), measles, and vaccinia. Mesothelioma is a particularly virulent untreatable
tumor caused by exposure to asbestos. NDV (a chicken virus) has been shown to
be effective in treatment of this tumor in a mouse model [31].
Oncolytic biotech, a company in Calgary, Canada, has been testing reolysin, a
reovirus in combination with cisplatinum and other chemotherapeutic agents on
squamous cell carcinoma. Reovirus acts by both direct tumor cell killing and
priming of antitumor immunity; reovirus does not replicate in normal cells but does
replicate in cancer cells. Normal cells express the ras gene, a known oncogene,
which inhibits reovirus replication. In the tumor cells that carry a mutation of ras,
the virus can replicate. The major mechanism of reovirus oncolysis of cancer cells
has been shown to occur through apoptosis [32, 33]. In addition, the synergistic
anti-tumor effects of reovirus in combination with radiation or chemotherapy has
been demonstrated for reovirus-resistant and moderately sensitive tumors. Phase III
clinical trials are ongoing and early results of the phase III trial are very promising.
Of the 105 total patients with evaluable metastatic tumors, 86 % (n = 50) of those
in the test arm of the study exhibited tumor stabilization or shrinkage, compared
with 67 % of patients (n = 55) in the control arm. (More information is available at
http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT01166542). In most of the clinical
trials undertaken to date, an anti-reovirus immune response likely to circumvent
anti-tumor efﬁcacy has been seen. Newer methods are being used to deliver reovirus
to tumor sites, such as loading the virus into dendritic cells and killer lymphocytes,
which helps in activating the immune system, and abrogates the effect of speciﬁc
anti-reovirus antibodies [34]. Reovirus has also been used as an oncolytic agent in
phase I trials against multiple myeloma. It is considered to have a great deal of
oncolytic potential.
Parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses, among the smallest
viruses affecting mammals. Parvovirus H1 is an autonomous replicating virus that
has been shown to grow in culture, preferentially in tumor cells. H1 has oncolytic

effects on human tumors in mice; these effects are enhanced by the incorporation
of cytokine genes into the H1 genome [35–37]. A phase I/II trial has been initiated
with the H1 parvovirus in the treatment of glioblastoma; this study has just gotten
under way and patients are being recruited.
Other viruses currently undergoing clinical trial include rhabdoviruses, in
particular vesicular stomatitis virus, an RNA virus that replicates very quickly, and
at least in culture lyses cells within 24 h, giving it an advantage as an oncolytic
agent. Early studies, as in the case of all the oncolytic viruses, have proved their
usefulness in culture and in tumors in mice. However, VSV is very sensitive to
interferons (in fact, this virus is used as an indicator strain in interferon assays)
which would inhibit its oncolytic potential, unless the interferon pathway were
blocked, but this in turn might inhibit tumor apoptosis. In fact, the ﬁrst clinical trial
with VSV includes a virus carrying an interferon gene, which seems counter-
intuitive. The aim of the study reads, ‘‘The primary purpose of this study is to
evaluate the safety of a viral agent called vesicular stomatitis virus for the use in
patients with liver cancer. The study virus has a gene inserted into it which will
allow for the production of interferon beta, which is a substance that will have the
dual functions of restricting the spread of the virus to the tumor cells and not
healthy liver cells and also to have some independent anti-cancer activity.
Although the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of delivery of this
viral agent to people, patients may beneﬁt clinically by having shrinkage or sta-
bilization of their tumor or reduction in their cancer related symptoms (e.g., pain)’’
(http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01628640).
A novel non-lytic replicating retroviral vector (TOCA511) has been derived
from mouse murine leukemia virus encoding yeast cytosine deaminase (CD). This
enzyme converts the prodrug 5-ﬂuorocytosine (5-FC) to the potent anticancer
drug, 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) in an infected tumor [38, 39]. This retrovirus has been
extensively tested in animal systems and is now in clinical trial. Three of the
ongoing trials involve brain tumors in which the virus is directly injected into the
brain. In some cases these are patients who have not responded to chemotherapy;
in others, the virus is injected after tumor removal. All will be treated with 5-
ﬂurouracil for 6 months after initial treatment with the virus. To quote, ‘‘This is a
multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Toca 511, a retroviral
replicating vector, injected into the resection cavity of patients with recurrent or
progressive Grade III or Grade IV gliomas who have elected to undergo surgical
removal of their tumor. Approximately 6–7 weeks after injection of Toca 511, the
patient will take an oral course of 5-FC, an antifungal antibiotic. These courses of
5-FC will be repeated during the 6-month study. MRI scans will be performed
approximately every 2 months. Three subjects will be evaluated at up to 5 dose
levels of Toca 511. The dose of Toca 511 a patient receives will depend upon the
number of previous study participants and how well they have tolerated the study
drugs.’’ http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01470794.

Viral Oncolysis or Virotherapy

17.8
Conclusions
As more trials with oncolytic viruses have occurred, it has become obvious that
one has to take into account the extracellular environment of the tumor and the
surrounding tissue. Viruses may affect the blood supply to the tumor, either by
diminishing it or by increasing the ﬂow. The virus may also enhance the immune
response to the tumor or may in fact inhibit its own growth by inducing interferon
(which could also inhibit tumor growth). Thus it has become clear that what started
off as a simple idea is much more complicated than originally assumed. From these
experiments, certain valid principles can be established: namely, one has to use
non-pathogenic virus that replicates in the tumor, and not in the healthy tissue of
the patient. The virus should be ﬁrst tested in cell culture to examine host range
and tissue speciﬁcity, very much as is done with bacteriophage therapy on speciﬁc
host bacteria. It is apparent from in vitro work that most lytic viruses, that is,
viruses that replicate and destroy the cell, could be used for the treatment of
tumors. Some are without modiﬁcation, but others with modiﬁcation, in order to
neutralize serious side effects on the patients. A major problem is the production of
antibodies and cytotoxic T-cells to the virus, which requires the use of a succession
of different viruses during treatment; the other is to direct the virus to metastatic
sites. This might be achieved by intra-venous injection of the virus, but this may
lead to a systemic infection, or the virus may be destroyed by a strong immune
response.
After a long haul, it ﬁnally seems that viral oncolysis has found a place in
cancer therapy. The ultimate aim is to eliminate or reduce the need for chemo-
therapy. Viral oncolysis may be enhanced with the aid of immunotherapy by
adding cytokines either directly with the virus, or as a transgene in the virus. Other
cytokines, such as interferon (despite its side effects) and IL-2 or others of the
many newly discovered cytokines, could be incorporated into potential oncolytic
viruses and their effects studied. Obviously the recent breakthroughs imply that
more research is needed.

Virotherapy and Biotech Companies
It does appear that biotech companies that speciﬁcally specialize in this area are
carrying out the majority of the studies on viral oncolysis. The success obtained by
Shanghai Sunway Biotech with an adenovirus vector, Amgen with a herpes vector;
and Oncolytic Biotech with reovirus (Reolysin) are very encouraging. Among
other companies now engaged in phase II trials, a Finnish company, Oncos bio-
tech, with a new generation of replicating adenovirus vectors, and Cold Genesis of
Irvine, California, utilizing an adenovirus vector also with GM-CSF in the treat-
ment of BCG-resistant bladder cancer. Also of interest is Jennerex, using a
recombinant vaccinia virus, lacking the thymidine kinase gene, and incorporating
GM-CSF. This virus is now being used in the treatment of colon and pancreatic

cancer. An announcement in September, 2013, of another trial indicated that this
phase II trial did not meet its end point (survival) in late-stage liver cancer.
Viralytics is running clinical trials to investigate the use of CAVATAK,TM a
natural, genetically unaltered Coxsackie virus (part of the common cold family of
viruses). Virttu Biotech is a Glasgow-based company using a herpes simplex 1
modiﬁed virus in the treatment of mesothelioma; a phase I/II has just been started.
PsiOxus is an English/German company using adenoviruses (other than adenovirus
5 used by other companies) in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Again, this is a
phase I/II trial.
DNAtrix is developing oncolytic adenoviruses speciﬁcally to attack glioblas-
toma. ‘‘There is now compelling evidence that DNX-2401 can (i) replicate in
human tumors for a period of weeks to months, (ii) elicit tumor necrosis within
weeks of injection, (iii) trigger intratumoral immune cell inﬁltration and (iv) lead
to long term tumor destruction detectable by MRI.’’ Perhaps more importantly, the
study agent, DNX-2401 was safe and well tolerated in the clinic with no serious
product-related toxicities to date. The phase I trial, which measures tolerability,
also indicated a response on the tumor itself. Phase II trials are ongoing, there is no
doubt that viral oncolysis has been given a second life. We have to await the
results as to whether this treatment shrinks tumors and prolongs life. I am opti-
mistic that virotherapy will become a regular part of cancer treatment.

Gene Therapy and Viral Vectors
Abstract
Gene therapy is the administration of a normal gene to replace a defective gene
and thus cure or alleviate suffering from genetic diseases. Researchers are
currently looking at a number of genetic diseases as targets, such as severe
combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID), cystic ﬁbrosis, and hemophilia, among
others. In most cases, the genes are incorporated into a viral vector. These
viruses may have a segment of genetic material removed and replaced with a
‘‘normal’’ gene, known as a ‘‘transgene.’’ The ﬁrst clinical trial, which was a
failure, was in 1980, when a small number of patients with thalassemia were
treated with the human globin DNA. In 1995 the ﬁrst successful trial was
performed in children with a defect in adenosine deaminase (ADA) (SCID-
syndrome). Treatment of SICD-X1 children, a condition leading to immuno-
deﬁciency, was also successful, but the retrovirus vector underwent integration
into the host chromosome, resulting in a few cases of leukemia and one death.
A large number of different viral vectors have been designed for use in gene
therapy, including retrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus and parvovirus. These are
each discussed separately. Despite great efforts and a large number of clinical
trials, only one vector system—AAV, Glybera—has been approved for gene
therapy for the treatment of patients with lipoprotein lipase deﬁciency, a rare
genetic disease.
18.1
An Introduction to Gene Therapy
Inherited diseases account for a substantial number of diseases, including up to
70 % of all admissions to children’s hospitals and 10 % of admissions to adult
hospitals. Furthermore, many of the most common inherited disorders, including
thalassemia, cystic ﬁbrosis, and sickle-cell anemia, and some of the rarer ones,

such as adenosine deaminase (ADA) deﬁciency (severe combined immune deﬁ-
ciency) still lack treatments beyond palliative care although there has been limited
success in treating these conditions with gene therapy. I began writing this chapter
with a great deal of hope that gene therapy using viral vectors had made large
strides since the ﬁrst clinical trials in the 1980s, and was close to clinical reali-
zation. By the end of the review of the literature,—and it is a large literature—I
concluded that this was still a challenge, with a few successes and many failures
along the way. Only now, after 40 years of experimental trials, are there some
positive results, but just one vector-gene therapy system has been approved for
usage in the U.S. and western Europe. A few viral vectors have been approved in
China, but for viral oncolysis, which is different from gene therapy.
Based on studies of bacterial transformation where one gene can be replaced by
another, it seemed obvious that once one could excise genes with restriction
enzymes, one should be able to incorporate a normal gene into a virus and use that
virus as a vehicle to infect a cell or body to replace a defective gene. The
replacement could be done ex vivo, that is, in cell culture, and then such cells
infused back into the patient (Fig. 18.1), or done by direct inoculation into the
blood system or into a targeted organ.
During the last 50 years, many attempts have been made to realize these goals.
Experiments performed in cell culture have shown that it is possible to express the
transgene, as the introduced gene is called. Experiments performed in mice indi-
cate that a foreign gene can be expressed from a viral vector, but often its activity

Gene Therapy and Viral Vectors

is extinguished by the wrong promoter or controlling element, or by the production
of antibodies or other components of the immune response. In other cases, the
expression of the transgene has been short lived. In human experimentation, safety
has to be taken into account. There is danger of an inﬂammatory reaction to the
virus, even if defective, and an immune response, including the production of
antibodies, which would prevent reintroducing the same virus vector more than
once if necessary, for continuous treatment.
Along the way, there have been disappointments and failures as well as tragic
accidents. To date, there have been 1,700 clinical trials in gene therapy, but most
of them have used viruses to treat cancer (viral oncolysis) and very few are gene
replacement therapy trials or supplying a missing function.
In the gene therapy ﬁeld, as in other endeavors of science, much has depended
on the roles of key individuals and their personalities. The main players in this
ﬁeld were French Anderson, Ted Friedman, Inder Verma and Jim Wilson. French
Anderson was a leader in the ﬁeld, and announced to the world the ﬁrst ‘‘cure’’ in a
child with severe combined immune-deﬁciency (although there might have been a
little hype in the presentation and announcement).
The idea of gene therapy was really born in the 1970s as a result of the
advances made in molecular biology and the development of recombinant DNA
technology. It was possible to ‘‘cut out’’ a gene and surrounding controlling ele-
ments with restriction enzymes (enzymes that spliced out segments of DNA
depending on the sequence), joining such segments with other segments, and insert
such sequences into a virus without altering its ability to be engulfed by a cell. Of
course, although this sounds simple, problems and questions arose even in initial
experiments in culture. These included: What controls the expression of the gene
inserted into the virus? Is expression enough to provide the missing or defective
function? Does the virus need to replicate in the cell or is the expression from a
single viral infection enough? When it came to performing gene therapy in an
animal model (usually mouse), the major problems multiplied. How does one
target the gene to the site of the genetic defect, e.g., liver, lung, neurons, etc.? Can
one get the right amount of expression, i.e., not too little and not too much? Do we
need a replication-competent virus? Does the patient have antibodies to this virus
that would inhibit expression? These are among the multitudinous questions that
arose, and many have been answered as a result of actual trials.
There are also ethical issues to be considered. Gene therapy as described in this
chapter, and as performed in clinical trials to date, is using the gene (or the cognate
protein) as a therapeutic or pharmaceutical agent. This is ‘‘somatic’’ gene therapy
and implies replacing a defective gene with a normal copy of the gene, thus
providing the normal protein product of that gene. It does not involve embryonic
stem cell modiﬁcation, which would result in subsequent generations bearing the
‘‘transduced’’ gene. One could argue that somatic gene therapy is harmful to
mankind, in that if the ‘‘cured’’ individual has children, they will carry the
defective gene. To date, there has not been an attempt to alter embryonic stem
cells that would give rise to altered progeny—which is a much-debated subject.
Not so long ago it was thought that this was not possible, but with the cloning of
18.1

animals such as sheep and cows, it is conceivable that one would learn how to
change the genetic makeup of man and thus subsequent generations. However,
who would decide whether such changes should be made? How might it affect
other genetic characters of the individual? Modiﬁcation of a single gene may have
many pleiotropic effects.
Historically, there have been two methods of performing gene therapy: one
ex vivo and the other in vivo. In ex vivo gene therapy, lymphocytes or other cell
types are collected from the patient and cultured for a period to select the desired
cell type. These cells are transformed in culture, with a virus carrying the desirable
gene, grown for a period of time in culture, and then returned into the patient. This
may be accompanied either with or without full bone marrow transplant and
radiation treatment. This method has been used successfully in treating children
with a number of different immune-deﬁcient diseases (see Fig. 18.1).
A second method is to directly inject into the body (intramuscular or intrave-
nous) a virus carrying the selected gene, or just DNA. A major problem is targeting
the DNA or virus to the desired organ, and in preliminary trials gene expression
has been weak and only transitory. Many methods have been developed to enhance
the efﬁciency of uptake and to prevent the destruction of the DNA.
18.2
Early Days of Gene Therapy
As discussed in Chap. 3 (History of Cell Culture), the key to early gene therapy
experiments was the availability of mutant somatic cells in culture. These were of
two kinds: cells isolated from humans or mice carrying a genetic defect, or induced
mutations resembling a known genetic defect. A number of model systems were
established, most with defects in purine metabolism. Purines are essential for cell
growth and animal development. The purines, adenine and guanine, are the
building blocks of nucleic acids, and also precursors of key molecules such as ATP
and GTP, the energy source in the cells. Many mutants were isolated in the purine
salvage pathway, a metabolic pathway that utilizes free purines derived from the
breakdown of nucleic acids, and differs from the de novo pathway, where purines
are synthesized from simpler precursors such as amino acids and bicarbonate
through multiple steps. Three genetic defects were used as a model system:
hypoxanthine-guanine phophoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), adenine phosphori-
bosyl transferase (APRT) and adenosine deaminase (ADA).
HGPRT catalyzes the formation of guanosine monophosphate (GMP), an
essential building block in nucleic acid formation. A defect in this gene in humans
results in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which may result in severe mental retar-
dation and self-mutilation. A partial defect of this enzyme can cause high levels of
uric acid, resulting in gout. This defect only occurs in males since it is X-linked
(only one X chromosome is present in males). Cell lines defective in this gene can
be isolated following treatment with mutagens and selection in thioguanine. Such
mutants are easy to isolate and occur at a high frequency because of one copy of
the active gene.

APRT is an enzyme that salvages free adenine to form AMP. APRT deﬁciency
is a rare defect in man, but a lack of this enzyme may lead to kidney stones. Cells
defective in APRT activity are selected in di-aminopurine, which is toxic to cells.
Such mutants are relatively rare, both in culture and in man, since they are
autosomal-recessive. In cells in culture, there are probably two or more copies of
the APRT gene. Many cell lines defective in APRT and in HGPRT were isolated
and used later for in vitro gene therapy experiments [1, 2].
ADA deﬁciency results in a severe defect of the immune system in man. A
mutation in this gene results in a severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID)
phenotype, a complete lacking of humeral immunity. Babies born with this defect
were at one time kept in plastic bubbles and known as ‘‘bubble babies.’’ This is an
autosomal recessive mutation that leads to a defect in the functioning of T-cells, B-
cells and NK cells. It became one of the ﬁrst targets for gene therapy in humans [3].
Thus the availability of mutant cell lines allowed one to test whether a
recombinant virus containing a transgene would repair defects in the cell [4].
Although the idea of using viruses to transfer genetic material developed from the
research with transducing phage in the early days of molecular biology, it was
difﬁcult to envisage how this could be performed with animal viruses. It was
known that both DNA and RNA tumor viruses (retroviruses) integrated into the
host cell after infection and brought about transformation in culture (‘‘transfor-
mation’’ implies extended growth, and phenotypic alteration of the cell). Until the
ﬁnding of restriction enzymes and their use to splice out segments of DNA, it was
difﬁcult to conceptualize how foreign genes could be incorporated into a virus.
Gene therapy experiments were performed using chemical means of introducing
DNA into cells and even into mice and later humans, but gene expression was very
low.
Martin Cline performed the ﬁrst human gene therapy experiments in 1980, on
patients in Italy and in Israel. He harvested bone marrow cells from individuals
with thalassemia (an inherited blood disorder in which hemoglobin synthesis is
affected), transfected these cells in vitro with plasmid containing the human globin
gene, and transplanted the cells back into the patients after radiation. The Human
Subjects Committee at UCLA had not approved the experiment, although it was
approved by the hospitals in Naples and Jerusalem. Many scientists thought the
experiments premature, and without sufﬁcient background experiments in mice,
although as pointed out by Cline, mice do not get thalassemia. The result was that
the experiments were condemned as being too hasty, and Cline lost his position at
UCLA. The experiments failed, but nonetheless these failed experiments gave a
boost to the ﬁeld of gene therapy [5, 6].
In 1983 a group of scientists gathered at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories to
discuss the future of gene therapy. The leaders in the ﬁeld, French Anderson, Paul
Berg, and Ted Friedmann, organized a meeting that was cautiously upbeat. This
was a period when retrovirus vectors were being constructed, and appeared ideal
for gene therapy. Genes were cloned into a retrovirus, making it defective, and
helper genes or a helper virus could be grown in the same cells as the defective
virus, resulting in an infectious defective virus (Fig. 18.3). Retroviruses were

shown to infect many different cell types and give rise to stable transfected cells.
The virus mostly used was mouse leukemia virus, assuming that defective mouse
retroviruses would be harmless to humans. Retroviruses carrying the HPRT gene
could overcome the defect in HPRT-deﬁcient cells, and retroviruses with ADA
could also restore ADA activity in human lymphocytes.
Within a few years it was shown that viruses carrying exogenous genes could
transform many different cell types. Other vectors were also created, including
adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses (AAV), herpesviruses and vaccinia
vectors … In fact, during the 1980s, ex vivo gene transfer experiments were not
only performed for ADA and HGPRT deﬁciencies but also for coagulation deﬁ-
ciencies for factors XIII and IX, for hypocholeterolemia and many other genetic
conditions. My laboratory developed adenovirus vectors and AAV vectors car-
rying the APRT gene and the interferon gene [7, 8]. The vectors and methods
eventually used in gene therapy clinical trials are presented in Fig. 18.2.
18.3
Gene Therapy of ADA Deficiency
Figure 18.3 presents schematically the retrovirus system used to construct gene
therapy vectors. The aim was to create a defective non-replicating virus that can be
grown in a packaging cell line, but cannot replicate in vivo. Cells containing this
defective virus can be selected by including an antibiotic-resistant marker, which
would kill non-transformed cells.
ADA deﬁciency results in the accumulation of a substrate of the enzyme ADA,
deoxyadenosine, which is converted into the toxic compound deoxyadenosine
triphosphate in T-cells, thus disabling the immune system. Children with ADA

deﬁciency suffer from opportunistic infections. The ﬁrst approved clinical trial was
launched in September 1989. R. Michael Blaese and French Anderson and col-
leagues at the NIH introduced the gene for ADA into two children suffering from

SCID. The ﬁrst child was a four-year-old girl who had led a cloistered existence,
avoiding contact with people, remaining in a sterile environment at home, and
constantly battling infections; the other was a nine-year-old girl. This was a two-
step process, in which the vector, a retrovirus carrying the ADA gene, was
introduced into lymphocytes from the children ex vivo, and the lymphocytes were
then introduced back into the patient’s blood stream. The retrovirus used was a
defective virus, lacking the genes for coat protein synthesis. It was able to be
grown in culture with a cell infected either with a helper virus, or with genes
incorporated into a plasmid and maintained in a helper cell line (Fig. 18.3). The
preliminary experiments indicated that cells infected with the retrovirus vector
could be maintained in culture for a long period and continue to produce ADA, but
in lower amounts than expected. When transferred in vivo, they likewise produced
lower-than-expected amounts of ADA, and such children continued the PEG-ADA
enzyme therapy. That is the ADA enzyme conjugated to a polyethylene glycol
molecule for stability. However, the health of the treated children improved. The
virus used in these studies was a Moloney murine leukemia virus under the control
of the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence of the retrovirus, and the ADA gene
under the control of an SV-40 promoter [9]. This recombinant retrovirus was the
most-used vector in these early studies. The LTR sequence contained information
for regulating gene expression, including strong promoter sequences. and a variety
of initiation factor binding sites that drive gene expression. The LTR can also be
excised from the virus and used as a promoter for non-viral sequences; however, if
it integrates by recombination into a patient’s chromosome next to an oncogene, it
might overexpress the oncogene with resulting leukemia.
The results of an initial trial were reported in 1995 [10]. The injection of ADA
transformed lymphocytes continued periodically for 2 years. Both children suf-
fered from the genetic illness in varying degrees, and both had previously been
treated with PEG-ADA but had stopped responding to it. The treatment with ADA-
T-cells resulted in signiﬁcant but incomplete beneﬁt. Both patients showed an
increased T-cell response after the ADA-vector, but the amount of ADA produced
was not enough to provide a complete cure. However, both were healthy enough to
attend school. One of the fears expressed in these initial trials was the possibility of
‘‘insertional mutagenesis,’’ which means that the retrovirus might integrate into an
oncogene or near an oncogene and cause cancer. However this was not seen in
these two cases. The paper presenting this data concludes,
Our trial here has demonstrated the potential efﬁcacy of using gene-corrected autologous
cells for treatment of children with ADA-SCID. Eleven children with this disease have
been enrolled in various gene therapy protocols, each using different strategies and ret-
roviral vector designs and focusing on different target cell populations. The experience
gained from these approaches should provide guidance for gene therapy as a treatment for
this disorder as well as for a larger array of inherited and acquired diseases.

A major breakthrough occurred in France when 11 children with immunode-
ﬁciency–X1 (SCID-X1), a defect in the gene for the interleukin receptor cc gene,
received a retrovirus, Moloney murine leukemia virus, containing an exogenous cc
cytokine receptor gene. SCID X1 is characterized by faulty T-cell and NK-cell
differentiation. It is found in ‘‘bubble’’ boys, is X-linked, and most children
afﬂicted with it die at about age one. After a 10-month follow-up period, cc
transgene-expressing T- and NK-cells were detected in two patients. Cell counts
and function, including antigen-speciﬁc responses, were comparable to those of
age-matched controls [11]. Similar experiments were performed in England using
a different retrovirus system—gibbon ape leukemia virus pseudotype retrovirus.
This vector uses the coat protein of the gibbon ape leukemia virus, which has an
extended host range and also enters non-dividing cells.
Although most infants showed dramatic improvement following gene therapy,
four of the nine infants that were successfully treated in Paris developed leukemia
between 3 and 6 years after the treatment, and one of the infants successfully treated
in London also developed a form of leukemia, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(T-ALL). All of these cases are the result of the retrovirus gene integrating into a
speciﬁc chromosomal site. In both studies the transgene was integrated into the
LMO2 chromosomal gene, a known oncogene, and in one other case into the cyclin
D2 gene, essential in cell cycle regulation. Multiple mutations were also found in the
children with leukemia; except for one, all responded to chemotherapy.
18.4
Lentivirus as Vectors
In recent years, research has focused on the use of lentivirus vectors, which, like
retrovirus vectors, are devoid of viral proteins, free from replication-competent
virus, and unlike retrovirus vectors, are able to transduce non-dividing cells [12].
This characteristic is advantageous in many gene therapeutic applications targeting
highly differentiated cells. They can carry up to 8 kb of exogenous material and
are normally not inactivated by antibodies in the body. Currently, these lenti-
vectors are applied in about 3.3 % of clinical trials (see Fig. 18.2).
Lentiviruses include HIV and Visna virus. They are called lentivirus because it
takes a long time for symptoms to manifest themselves in an infection (len-
ti = slow in Latin). The favorite virus for gene therapy is, surprisingly, HIV. To
obtain a lentiviral gene therapy vector, a reporter gene or therapeutic gene is
cloned into a vector sequence that is ﬂanked by LTRs and the Psi-sequence of
HIV (see above for function of LTRs: Psi sequence is needed for packaging). The
LTRs are necessary to integrate the therapeutic gene into the genome of the target
cell, just as the LTRs in HIV are necessary to integrate the dsDNA copy of the
virus into its host chromosome. The Psi-sequence acts as a signal sequence and is
necessary for packaging RNA with the transgene in virions. Viral proteins, which
make virus shells, are provided in the packaging cell line, but are not in the
genome with the LTRs and Psi-sequences and so are not packaged into virions.
Thus, virus particles are produced that are replication-deﬁcient, designed so that
18.3
Gene Therapy of ADA Deficiency
345

they are unable to infect their hosts after they deliver their therapeutic content.
Newer lentivirus vectors contain self-inactivating LTR sequences that prevent the
integration or recombination with the host chromosome. These vectors contain a
deletion in the downstream LTR that when transduced into target cells results in
the transcriptional inactivation of the upstream LTR and substantially diminishes
the risk of vector recombination with the host chromosome and other viruses. A
400-base pair region includes the ‘‘tat’’ region (trans-activator of transcription, an
important region in HIV expression and regulation), which is deleted from the
LTR (Fig. 18.4). Hybrid lentiviral vectors have also been derived from non-human
lentiviruses (for example, simian, equine, feline, caprine and bovine), similar to
those used for HIV-derived vectors, using the rationale that they would be more
acceptable for clinical application because the parental viruses are not infectious to
humans. Lentiviruses are currently being tested in a large number of phase I and
phase II trials [13].
Lentiviruses have been used in many experimental systems. For example, a
model of mouse hemophilia is corrected by expressing wild-type platelet factor
VIII, the gene mutated in human hemophilia. Diabetic mice have been treated with
the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a therapy being con-
sidered for use in humans. The host range of the lentivirus vector is expanded by
using the VSV–G protein. This has been used in experimental animals by direct
injection of the vector with the transgene, rather than ex vivo use.
18.5
Adenovirus Vectors
Adenovirus was used and tested as a vector for gene therapy in the 1980s. There are
a large number of species of human adenoviruses, very few of which appear to be
very pathogenic to man. The subtype selected for gene therapy was adenovirus-5,
Fig. 18.4 Lentiviruses vector. With permission from gene therapy.net (http://www.genetherapy.

346
18
Gene Therapy and Viral Vectors

which causes symptoms in man similar to the common cold. Adenovirus-5 can
cause tumors in hamsters, and does not replicate in mice. As discussed in the
chapter on viral oncolysis, viral vectors are produced by removing speciﬁc ade-
novirus genes, in particular the E3 gene (involved in immune response) and the
E1a-E1b genes. Removal of the E3 gene results in a replicative competent virus,
while removal of E1 gives rise to a defective non-replicating virus. Since the
adenovirus will not replicate without the E1 gene, packaging cell lines similar to
those described above for retrovirus have been constructed. The cell line most used
is 293, and contains an integrated E1 sequence (Figs. 18.5 and 18.6). A recombi-
nant adenovirus carrying the rat ornithine transcarbamylase deﬁciency (OTC) gene
under the control of the adenovirus late promoter was constructed and injected into
newborn mice. An increase in OTC activity was observed with a decrease in orotic
acid in the urine. The transferred gene was active for more than a year following the
injection, and this was the ﬁrst case where it could be shown that a recombinant
adenovirus bearing an exogenous gene could restore impaired metabolism [14].
This gene was later used in the human experiments discussed below.
A major paper in the developing ﬁeld of gene therapy was published in Science
in 1991 [15], indicating that it was possible to deliver an adenovirus with the
human a-1-anti-trypsin gene to the lung of cotton rats. A replication-deﬁcient
adenoviral vector (Ad-al-AT) containing an adenovirus major late promoter and a
recombinant human a-1 anti-trypsin gene was used to infect epithelial cells of the
rat respiratory tract both in vitro and in vivo. After in vivo intra-tracheal admin-
istration of Ad-arlAT to the rats, human a-l-anti-trypsin messenger RNA was
observed in the respiratory epithelium, the human protein was synthesized and
secreted by lung tissue, and the human gene product was detected in the epithelial
lining ﬂuid for at least 1 week [15].
The main defect in cystic ﬁbrosis is chloride transport. The CF gene—its
product being the cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR),
and its major mutation, Delta F508, was discovered in 1989. The research pre-
sented above in rats stimulated clinical trials with the normal cystic ﬁbrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator gene in humans. Initial experiments were
successfully performed in vitro on rat lung epithelial cells [16]. Jim Wilson’s
group in Philadelphia performed similar studies with non-human primates with an
E1 deleted, and thus defective adenovirus in baboons. A total of 14 animals were
used, receiving escalating doses. Individual animals were killed and lung tissue
examined after 4 and 21 days. The expression of the transgene was proportional to

the dose of virus, and diminished with time. These studies indicated that for gene
transfer to work in cystic ﬁbrosis patients, there was a need for multiple doses [17].
A small clinical trial of three patients with CF was performed by nasal adminis-
tration of the E1-deleted adenovirus carrying the CFTR gene. No adverse effects
were found, and there was restoration of CFTR activity [18]. A similar trial was
performed in four other patients, and similar results were obtained. After 6 months
there did not seem to be adverse effects. Doses as high as 2 9 109 virus were used,
but expression of the transgene was only transient, and repeat injections (or nasal
administration) of the virus did not enhance expression of the CFTR gene due to
antibody production against the virus. One possibility considered was to admin-
ister various adenovirus serotypes with the gene.
However, numerous trials using various vectors failed to cure cystic ﬁbrosis. In
part, this was due to a lack of knowledge of the complexity of the lung as well as
lack of knowledge of the biology of adenovirus. In an article in 2012, Ron Crystal
writes,
We found that it is possible to use viral vectors to transfer the CFTR gene to the airway
epithelium and ‘‘cure’’ CF in a limited region of the nasal or airway epithelium, but that
the innate and acquired immune defenses of the lung eliminate the foreign gene within a
short time, limiting the period of effectiveness of the therapy. Subsequent efforts in the
1990s to make vectors ‘‘stealth’’ failed to circumvent the lung’s host defenses. … But is
gene therapy for CF feasible in the near future? After all, the gene therapy ﬁeld has had

348
18
Gene Therapy and Viral Vectors

recent remarkable successes in therapy for blindness, immunodeﬁciency, and hemophilia.
As much as I would like to see CF gene therapy added to this list, with the advantage of
more than 20 years of hindsight, I think successful gene therapy for CF is still a long way
off. The physical and host defense barriers of the lung are simply too great. While I
applaud the efforts and admire the creative new approaches, it is doubtful there will be
successful clinical trials for CF in the next decade. This does not mean that the McCray
and other laboratories toiling away at CF gene therapy should give up, because their work
is critical for continued progress toward therapy for CF, but they and the CF community
should not expect a gene therapy ‘cure’ in the near or midterm future [19].
The ﬁeld of gene therapy was shocked and set back in 1999 by the death of a
young man undergoing gene therapy for OTC. Until then, adenovirus had been
regarded as a harmless virus. Jesse Gelsinger was an 18-year-old who had a ‘‘mild’
form of OTC deﬁciency; his was not the typical inherited form, but occurred after
conception since some of his cells did metabolize normally. On September 13,
1999, he was injected with an adenovirus vector carrying the gene to test the safety
of the procedure. He died 4 days afterward of multiple organ failure, and it
appeared that there was a massive immune response to the virus. The FDA
investigated the case and censured the scientists involved: Jesse was not a suitable
subject for the trial because of high ammonia levels; the scientists had not reported
adverse effects in two other patients; and they had not reported in the consent
forms that monkeys had died following the same treatment. The scientist involved,
Jim Wilson, refuted the above accusations, indicating that the trials with the
monkeys were for a different disease, different vector and different gene. However,
Jesse’s death brought about a cessation in gene therapy trials for quite some time.
The center for gene therapy at the University of Pennsylvania closed in 2002, and
Jim Wilson resigned as director. There was talk of ﬁnancial improprieties, since
both Wilson and the university were involved with a company that had patents on
the vectors and was supporting the research. This company was later sold for large
sums of money. (A full disclosure and details of the Gelsinger case can be found at
http://cirge.stanford.edu/May%209%20-%20Gelsinger%20vs.%20UPenn/
Gelsinger%20-%20Oxford%20Textbook.pdf.)
Adenovirus vectors continued to be developed. A debate ensued as to whether a
vector should be defective, as used up until now with limited results, or non-
defective. Perusing the literature of the last 20 years, it seems that adenovirus use
has changed from being a tool of gene therapy, in the sense of repairing a genetic
defect, to one of viral oncolysis of cancer. There are a large number of clinical
trials utilizing adenovirus for this function (see Chap. 17). It would appear that our
knowledge of the virus and of human physiology is still lacking and that much
further research needs to be done.
18.5
Adenovirus Vectors

18.6
Adeno-Associated Virus
AAV belongs to the family of parvoviruses. This class of viruses is among the
smallest of animal viruses and has very limited genetic material, about 5,000 base
pairs. This small DNA virus has been studied extensively as a possible gene
therapy vector. As the name implies, it is dependent on adenovirus for growth and
is thus itself a defective virus. It has a broad host range and can be grown as an
integrated virus or lytic virus. There is a large number of serotypes, all non-
pathogenic to humans. High-copy numbers of the virus can be obtained by su-
perinfecting the cells with adenovirus [20]; however, its major limitation is the
small packaging capacity. The viral genome consists of only two genes (Fig. 18.7),
each producing many polypeptides. ‘‘Rep’’ is required for viral genome replication
and ‘‘cap’’ encoding structural proteins. These two genes are rounded by viral
repeat sequences that are 145 nucleotides in length. Vectors are created by
incorporating the desired therapeutic gene between the two ITR sequences, having
the rep and cap gene on a separate plasmid, and adding adenovirus as a third
component (Fig. 18.8).
AAV has a propensity to integrate into human chromosome 19, but this is lost
when the rep gene is removed. Thus, vectors are not incorporated into the chro-
mosome. Since the virus used in transduction does not have any viral sequences
(other than the ITR), it is non-toxic and non-pathogenic. The vector can be
delivered in vivo to multiple tissues and is under test for many different disease
situations. The virus used in most of the initial studies was AAV2. Important
advances have been made in altering the target range of AAV, by single alterations
of amino acid in the coat protein [21].
Several phase I clinical trials for gene therapy of inherited defects using ﬁrst-
generation AAV2 vectors have been completed or are currently in progress. For
instance, AAV2 vectors have been evaluated for gene transfer within the liver in
the treatment of hemophilia B; in the lung for treatment of cystic ﬁbrosis; in the
brain for treatment of Parkinson’s disease; within the joints for patients with
rheumatoid arthritis; and in the eye for treatment of Leber’s congenital amaurosis
and age-related macular degeneration. Leber’s congenital amaurosis is an eye
disorder that primarily affects the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back
of the eye that detects light and color. People with this disorder typically have
severe visual impairment beginning in infancy. The visual impairment tends to be
stable, although it may worsen very slowly over time and is the most common
cause of blindness in children. Perhaps the most striking example of successful

gene therapy in the clinic is the phase I trial of Leber’s congenital amaurosis.
Persistent improvement in the vision of affected patients has been reported in over
40 patients treated with AAV2 vectors delivering a corrective version of the
RPE65 gene [22, 23].

One of the interesting uses of AAV as a gene therapy agent has been its use in
the treatment of Rett syndrome and autism spectrum disorder. Researchers at the
Oregon Health and Science University used a vector AAV9 to penetrate the blood-
brain barrier to reverse the syndrome in mice [24]. This is still far from treatment
in humans, but is a step in the long struggle to ﬁnd either a cure or cause for
autism. Rett syndrome appears to be related to a defect in MECP2, methyl CpG
binding protein. The exact function of this gene is unknown. The protein may be
involved in gene splicing, and in synapsis in the brain. Rett syndrome is accom-
panied by neurological deterioration, and occurs mostly in girls. Growth and
development appear normal at ﬁrst, but after a few years there is severe and
progressive deterioration in speech and movement.
AAV has come to the forefront of gene therapy with the approval by the
European Commission in 2012 of a vector (Glybera) for treatment of a disease of
the pancreas, lipoprotein lipase deﬁciency (LPLD, also called familial hyperchy-
lomicronemia) [25]. This vector is manufactured by the uniQure Company, who
announced in July 2013 that it is building a 55,000-square foot plant in Massa-
chusetts to manufacture commercial-grade gene therapy products. It expects the
facility to be operational by early 2015.
18.7
Current Status of Gene Therapy
Most current gene therapy trials are for cancer, and not really for the repair of gene
defects unless cancer is classiﬁed as a genetic disease. Vectors being used to treat
cancer and the history of such usage are described in the chapter on viral oncolysis
(Chap. 17). About 60 % of all gene therapy trials involve the treatment of cancer.
In 2003, China became the ﬁrst country to approve a gene vector system for human
clinical use. ‘‘Gendicine’’ is an adenovirus vector in which the E1 gene is replaced
by the human p53 gene. This vector has been approved for the treatment of head
and neck cancers, but without a standard phase III trial [26]. Glybera (discussed
above) was rejected three times before being approved by the Committee on
Medicinal Human Products of the E.U.
A number of issues have hindered gene therapy; these include the possible
dangers inherent in using virus vectors. This has been shown in the case of ade-
novirus vectors, where overdose is fatal, and in the case of the use of retroviruses
where integration may occur. Human subjects committees and the recombinant
DNA committees of the NIH and other regulatory bodies have been very careful
about allowing clinical trials. The other aspect is a technical one: gene expression
is not optimum in most cases. One can argue that more time is needed to test
promoters; perhaps one should use natural promoters rather than viral promoters
for the transgene. We lack knowledge on gene regulation gene regulation, and a
major problem is that antibodies and the immune system may limit the number of
times one can deliver the transgene in a virus vector, which appears to be the case
with adenovirus vectors. Although there eventually will be gene therapy for the
medical treatment of speciﬁc diseases such as cystic ﬁbrosis, hemophilia, etc., we
352

may still have to wait a number of years. (A list of vectors discussed in this chapter

Vaccines Against Viral Infections
Abstract
Vaccines are one of the miracles of modern medicine. Without vaccines, the
population—particularly children—would be troubled with multitudinous
infectious diseases such as diphtheria, scarlet fever, whooping cough, and
measles, just to name a few. Vaccines are available against both viral and
bacterial infections; they have saved millions of lives and continue to do so.
The World Health Organization hopes to have vaccinated all children under a
year old against most infectious diseases by 2020. The history of the public’s
acceptance of vaccines has been a stormy one. Anti-vaccination movements
have been active since the creation or development of the smallpox vaccine in
the eighteenth century and in government-mandated vaccination until the
present. An example of this is the fabricated information spread about the
relationship between measles vaccine and autism. A successful polio vaccine
was developed in the 1950s thanks to the research of three groups, led by
Koprowski, Salk and Sabin, although each of these vaccines has its advantages
and disadvantages. An oral vaccine has the advantage of ease of administration
and a herd effect. Polio vaccine workers have become targets of extremists in
Nigeria and Pakistan. Recently, recombinant DNA technology, was used to
develop new vaccines in order to avoid the side effects, since live virus is not
involved. The future may see the production of vaccines in edible plants,
allowing for cheap production and ease in worldwide distribution.

Introduction
In 2011, it is estimated that 6.9 million children under ﬁve died, mostly from
diseases that are preventable by vaccination. This number is down from 12.4
million who died in 1990; thus, in 11 years, over 5 million lives were saved as a

result of the development of new vaccines, and a World Health Organization
campaign to vaccinate children in Africa, India and other less-developed countries,
through the ‘‘Global Vaccine Action Plan’’ (GVAP). The most common causes of
death among young children are acute respiratory infections, diarrhea from con-
taminated sources, measles, malaria, HIV and malnutrition, and most of these
deaths could have been prevented by vaccination. Table 19.1 lists the vaccines that
are administered to children (and adults) worldwide, when they were developed or
licensed, and the number of cases and coverage where available.
The World Health Organization launched a program, ‘‘Decades of Vaccines—
Global Action Plan 2011–2020’’ to promote more equitable access to vaccines
throughout the world. One of the aims of this program is the complete eradication of
poliovirus. However, this program has already run into trouble, since inhabitants of
the tribal areas of Pakistan, and certain groups in Nigeria, see the vaccination as a
CIA plot, and this has hindered the complete elimination of polio. Polio workers
carrying out the vaccination program, were shot and killed in Pakistan by Al Qaeda
and the Taliban. This results from the participation of a physician involved in the
polio vaccine campaign helping the US military in physicians to collect information
from the Osama bin Laden household which aided in identifying the Al Qaeda leader.
When the WHO launched the expanded program on immunization in 1974, less
than 5 % of the world’s children under age one were immunized against killers
such as polio, measles, and whooping cough; by 2020, the aim is to reach 80–90 %
of these children with available vaccines. It is currently estimated that 83 % of the
world’s children under age one receive vaccines against most killer diseases, and
new vaccines against hepatitis A and B are now administered (see Table 19.1).
However, one-ﬁfth of the world’s children—about 22.4 million infants—are not
immunized against these diseases. An estimated 1.5 million children died from
vaccine-preventable diseases in 2011.
It is obvious that vaccination has had a profound effect on the incidence of
disease in the U.S., and attempts to vaccinate the rest of the world against many of
these diseases are under way. Smallpox has been eradicated and polio is near
eradication. Tables 19.2 and 19.3 illustrate the effect those vaccines have had on
health in the U.S.
There has been much discussion recently on whether there is the need to
vaccinate children against so many infectious diseases. In particular, the necessity
of vaccinating against measles has been questioned, with the troubling menace of
measles outbreaks occurring in various parts of the world, speciﬁcally in the U.K.
Our guard against a number of known childhood diseases has been lowered
because of misinformation on the Internet, or even in scientiﬁc publications
relating vaccines to autism and other pathologies. Neglecting polio vaccination has
resulted in epidemics in various parts of the Middle East and Pakistan, and in India
in 2013. Just this year, emergency vaccinations against polio had to be given in
Israel and Syria.

government-mandated vaccination. In the U.S. and U.K., opponents to vacci-
nation have often been religious. Arguments against variolation, and later
vaccination, go back to the eighteenth century, even before Jenner and his
discovery of cowpox as protection against smallpox. Preachers pronounced
diseases as punishment for sins, and as such should not be treated. A national
poll conducted between 2005 and 2010 showed that 60 % of Americans did not
want to get ﬂu shots since they worried about side effects and over-vaccination
of the population. Recent opposition stems from a report in The Lancet in
1998, linking the measles mumps, and rubella vaccine to the onset of autism.
This paper was later withdrawn following the exposure of fabricated data, but
the measles vaccine program in the U.K., and to a lesser degree in the U.S.,
was severely damaged.
A discussion of the history and development of individual vaccines is presented
below.
19.2
Smallpox
A history of the smallpox vaccine is presented in Chaps. 1 and 9. To summarize:
Dr. Edward Jenner (1749–1823), a practicing physician in Berkeley, England
(Gloucestershire), had noted, as had others, that milkmaids appeared to be immune
to smallpox. Instead, their hands often had blisters picked up from cows who had
developed pocks on their teats, later shown to be caused by the cowpox virus (later
called ‘‘vaccinia’’). Jenner, who had a small laboratory in the shadows of Berkeley
Castle and its torture chambers in Northern England, inoculated a number of
children, including his 11-month-old son ﬁrst with cowpox, and then reported
protection against smallpox. Over 100,000 people had been vaccinated worldwide
by the year 1800. Most physicians accepted Jenner’s vaccine, although there was
some resentment against Jenner by other physicians who did not appreciate that the
‘‘cure’’ for smallpox was developed by a country physician. Others may have
resented the loss of revenue from treating smallpox [1]. In 1802, the British
Parliament discussed Jenner’s vaccine, upheld its usefulness and his claim that he
was the inventor of the method. Despite its success, and its use worldwide, there
continued to be opposition to the vaccine.
Not with standing this initial success, the production of the smallpox vaccine was
plagued with problems. Not least was the method of growing the cowpox virus in
amounts large enough to supply the demand. Initially it had to be isolated from pocks
on the cow’s udder. The virus was unstable over long periods and could not be
shipped long distances. It could be kept in dry storage for a few months but could not
tolerate heat or exposure to the sun. The supply could not keep up with the demand,
since one had to search for cows with cowpox, which was not all that common.
A unique method of transferring the virus was ‘‘arm-to-arm’’—that is, to
transfer the material from one individual after the formation of the scab from the
vaccination site to another individual. Although hard to believe, a girl who had
19.1

been recently vaccinated was sent to an orphanage in St. Petersburg, Russia, and
served as a source of the smallpox vaccine for all the children more than a week
old. The orphanage continued this practice from one child to another for 92 years
(1801–93) [2]
Then there was the Balmis Expedition, the goal of which was to bring the
vaccine to the New World and the American Indian population. The King of
Spain’s daughter had been stricken with smallpox in 1798. In 1803, Charles IV
ordered his personal physician, de Balmis, to deliver the vaccine to the inhabitants
of North and South America. To maintain the vaccine during its long trip across
the Atlantic, de Balmis recruited 22 young boys from orphanages in Spain, ages
3–9, who had never had smallpox. During the trip, de Balmis sequentially vac-
cinated the boys in a living chain and this was continued until the ship reached
Venezuela. More than 100,000 people were thus vaccinated in Latin America. The
‘‘Royal Smallpox Expedition,’’ as it was called, then recruited 22 more orphans
and continued the vaccination program in the Philippines, Macao and Canton [2].
At a medical congress in France in 1864, a better method of growing the virus
was reported from Italy and spread worldwide after the presentation. Cowpox
could be grown in large quantities by making a series of cuts in the ﬂank of a calf,
inoculating the virus into the animals’ skin, and harvesting the material from the
pocks 5 days later. This was still a crude way of preparing the vaccine, since it was
often contaminated with hair, bacteria, and other debris.
Around 1800, a Dr. J. Clinch, a medical missionary in Newfoundland, began
using Jenner’s vaccine, and by the end of 1801 he had vaccinated approximately
700 people. This was probably the ﬁrst vaccination of a community in North
America. By 1821 compulsory vaccination of infants was in place in Bavaria,
Denmark, Norway, Bohemia, Russia and Sweden. The British government passed
the vaccination act in 1840, after a smallpox epidemic from 1837 until 1840, made
variolation illegal and supplied smallpox vaccine (cowpox) free of charge. In 1853
the Vaccination Act was passed, requiring all children to receive smallpox vac-
cines by the age of 4 months; later on, the law was changed to allow parents who
objected to vaccination to appeal. This was known as the conscientious objection
law, hence the term ‘‘conscientious objector.’’ In 1905 the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that individual states could impose mandatory vaccination on children.
Despite this, or perhaps because of compulsory vaccination, there were many
who continued to oppose vaccination. One of the problems was that Jenner erred
when he proclaimed that immunity would last a lifetime. In fact, the immune effect
lapsed after 5–10 years and required re-inoculation. Others still objected on reli-
gious grounds, saying that it was interference in the ‘‘work of the Lord’’ and there
was quite a high level of accidents, in which vaccine was not directly taken from
pockmarks of the udder, and was contaminated with other viruses or bacteria. In
particular, cases of syphilis were reported both in the ‘‘arm-to-arm’’ method and
sometimes from the vaccine itself.
There was quite an active anti-vaccine campaign (see illustrations below of
pamphlets and posters from the Library of Medicine Website http://www.nlm.nih.
gov/copyright.html) (Fig. 19.1).

Vaccines Against Viral Infections

Smallpox was declared eradicated from the world in 1980, after an intensive
struggle to eradicate the virus. In fact, eradication began in 1803 when the Spanish
crown attempted to vaccinate the population of the Philippines. In 1813 the U.S.
Congress passed the vaccination act to insure safe vaccines for the U.S. public. By

1832, the U.S. government had set up a program for the vaccination of American
Indians. There was also a piecemeal attempt to eradicate the virus in areas of the
world, such as India and the East Indies. By 1897 smallpox had been eliminated
from the U.S. and by the beginning of the twentieth century from most industri-
alized countries of Europe. Despite this, each year of the 1950s, two million people
died from the disease. In 1959 the United Nations launched a campaign to erad-
icate smallpox from the world, and although it took longer than expected, the last
case of naturally occurring smallpox was in Somalia in 1977.
Smallpox was easier to eradicate than most other viruses for the following
reasons:
1. It is an acute infection that is neither chronic nor persistent.
2. There is no non-human reservoir or intermediate vector.
3. Only one species of the virus is very pathogenic.
4. The vaccine is relatively stable and easy to deliver.
As discussed elsewhere, this did not completely eliminate the virus from the
world, since stocks were retained for ‘‘research’’ purposes in the U.S. and Russia.
Unfortunately the Soviet Union grew the virus in large quantities for biological
warfare purposes.
Vaccination was stopped in the U.S. and most of the world in 1972. With the
advent of global terrorism and the development of biological weapons, it seemed
sensible to reintroduce vaccination against smallpox rather than wait for some
tragic event. Although there are reports of adverse effects in some cases, these do
not warrant the complete cessation, considering the fact that vaccination was
successful for over 100 years.
The smallpox vaccine became the model for the development of other vaccines.
Vaccines were based on the similarity of one virus to another, producing cross-
reacting antibodies. The current vaccine is derived from a clone of the virus
originally grown in calves and now produced in cell culture. The virus has changed
through many passages, and is no longer ‘‘cowpox’’ but a novel ‘‘poxvirus,’’ which
for years has been called ‘‘vaccinia.’’ The original Jenner ‘‘cowpox’’ has been lost.
19.3
Rabies
Rabies is an extremely frightening and dangerous infection, and folklore is rife
with stories of rabid dogs attacking humans. Rabies virus triggers foaming at the
mouth by stimulating the salivary glands to produce copious amounts of saliva for
the efﬁcient transmission of the virus. Pasteur and Roux developed a rabies vac-
cine in 1885. The virus was attenuated by passing the most virulent strain isolated
from rabid dogs through rabbits’ brains, harvested from the nerve tissue, and dried
for 5–10 days, resulting in an attenuated virus. The vaccine was delivered to
patients in the form of 10–14 intramuscular injections over a period of 2 weeks to
anyone suspected of having been in contact with a rabid animal.
362
19
Vaccines Against Viral Infections

The development of this vaccine is mired in controversy since it has been
claimed that it was not adequately tested before being used on a young nine-year-
old boy, Joseph Meister. Emil Roux, a young colleague of Louis Pasteur’s, was
studying for his MD degree and using the development of the rabies vaccine as a
research topic. Pasteur was an experimental scientist working on the vaccine, but
was not allowed by French law to treat patients. Joseph Meister had been mauled
by a rabid dog and was brought to Pasteur for help. Pasteur consulted with two
physicians, and since there seemed little hope of a cure since rabies is fatal, asked
one of the physicians to administer the untested vaccine. Using it on Meister has
come into some criticism and controversy in recent years [3] with the release of
Pasteur’s notebooks. Questions are being asked whether the vaccine was ade-
quately tested before being used in the Meister case, and doubts have been
expressed as to whether the boy had been bitten by a rabid dog. Both Pasteur and
Roux worked on the vaccine, but Roux’s name is not on the paper reporting the
treatment of Meister. Some [3] claim that Pasteur lied in his paper, stating that he
had treated 40 dogs with the vaccine, when in fact he had just initiated treatment
with 20 dogs, and that development of the vaccine was not far enough along to
warrant use in humans; there is also speculation that Roux might have opposed the
use of the vaccine.
There is obviously a moral question here: What does one do when there is a
possibly fatal case or illness? Wait until experimentation is complete? This is an
enigma facing many physicians today when faced with new, but untested treatment
for cancer or AIDS. Pasteur’s work with the rabies vaccine met with much
skepticism in the U.S. Doubts were expressed on the efﬁcacy of the vaccine, and
whether the vaccine itself led to the deaths of victims, who might not have been
exposed to a rabid dog but bitten by a healthy one.
In 1967 a vaccine was developed from attenuated rabies virus grown in cell
culture. This vaccine was extensively tested, and four or ﬁve subsequent injections
resulted in complete protection. Further improvement to the vaccine was made in
1971 by growing the rabies virus in human embryonic cells. Although Hilary
Koprowski’s team inoculated themselves with this new vaccine, the medical
profession did not like the idea of using a ‘‘live’’ rabies virus. Koprowski also
cloned the rabies virus glycoprotein into vaccinia and this vaccine is used to
control the disease in wild animals [4]. In 1976 an inactive rabies vaccine, called
human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) was licensed in Europe and in 1980 in the
U.S. One of its major advantages was that it was administered in ﬁve injections
rather than the 14–21 injections of the older vaccine, and this cell culture inactive
virus vaccine is now the one of choice.
In the 1950s while tending sheep I found an injured animal. Since I handled it, it
was suggested I get rabies shots, in case a rabid jackal had bitten the animal. This
was in the days before the modern vaccine, and I was given a series of 12 shots in
the abdomen as a precaution (I assume that this must have been the Pasteur
vaccine). After the shots the animal tested negative!
19.3
Rabies
363

The number of deaths from rabies in the United States had declined from
approximately 100 at the turn of the last century (1900) to one or two per year, and
those few cases are due to exposure to wildlife (bats). In the rest of the world, the
main source of rabies is still the rabid dog. More than 55,000 people die of rabies
each year in Asia and Africa; 40 % of those bitten by suspect rabid animals are
children less than 15 years old (WHO report).
19.4
Yellow Fever
When the Panama Canal opened in 1912, there was an urgent need for a vaccine
against yellow fever. Although transmitted by mosquitoes, the agent responsible
was still unknown. The Rockefeller Institute in New York sent one of its scientists,
Hideyo Noguchi, to Guayaquil, Ecuador, a center for epidemic outbreaks, to
investigate the possibilities of producing a vaccine. While in Ecuador, Noguchi
claimed to have discovered the agent causing yellow fever, a spirochete bacterium,
Leptospira icteroides [5]. He went on to develop a vaccine from this organism and
used it extensively in South America and Africa. Noguchi published many papers
reporting success with his vaccine, in a total of 7,964 cases. However, his results
were not reproducible, ﬁlters retained the agent he used, indicating that it was not a
viral disease, the statistics were faulty, and eventually the Rockefeller Institute
dropped the project. This material is also presented in Chap. 10.
In 1925 the Rockefeller Institute launched another scientiﬁc expedition, this
time to West Africa to determine whether African yellow fever was identical to
South American yellow fever. The aim was to characterize the causative agent,
including further search for Leptospira icteroides (the organism studied by
Noguchi), and to study its epidemiology. The expedition was led by Major Henry
Beeuwkes, a Johns Hopkins-trained bacteriologist retired from the army, and
Adrian Stokes, a London-based professor of pathology and expert on leptospirosis;
Noguchi and others joined him.
In June 1927, blood from a 28-year-old African yellow fever victim named
Asibi, was injected into a rhesus monkey. The monkey became ill, had symptoms
of yellow fever and became, thus, the ﬁrst case of an animal model for yellow
fever. A short while later, Stokes himself died of yellow fever. Noguchi pursued
his ideas that the disease was caused by Leptospira icteroides and inoculated over
one thousand monkeys with blood from yellow fever victims, but could not ﬁnd
any leptospira in them. Noguchi also contracted yellow fever and died in May
1928, as did a third investigator, who performed the autopsy on him [6]. However,
now that an animal model had been discovered, the infecting agent could be
removed to the laboratory for further study. Soon after, it was shown that serum
from immune humans, who had recovered from the infection, protected monkeys
against infection, and immune serum from South American patients protected
against the African ‘‘virus’’ (thus suggesting that one vaccine would offer pro-
tection globally). This strain of yellow fever was called ‘‘Asibi.’’
364
19
Vaccines Against Viral Infections

A French group in Dakar also collected blood from another patient, and pas-
saged the ‘‘virus’’ in rhesus monkeys. This gave rise to a strain of virus known as
the French strain. The virus could be frozen and work now pursued in the
laboratory.
Max Theiler, a South African working at the Rockefeller Institute, had been
involved in research on Leptospira icteroides, the organism proposed by Noguchi
as the causative agent of yellow fever. In 1927 he isolated a virus that appeared to
be the causative agent of the disease. Being aware of the previous literature on the
rabies virus, and on recent work on growing herpes virus in the brain of mice,
Theiler inoculated the yellow fever virus into mouse brains and found that it
reproduced. When injected into rhesus monkeys, the passaged virus was less
pathogenic systemically, but more neurotropic. This research was extremely
dangerous. The Rockefeller Institute announced in 1931 that there had been 32
cases of yellow fever in eight laboratories, with ﬁve fatalities. The French strain,
passaged a hundred more times in mouse brains, was administered to protect
laboratory and ﬁeld workers in 1931. The virus was combined with immune serum
from yellow fever-infected lab workers to prevent encephalitis. This vaccine was
successful and was used up until World War II. Meanwhile, the French scientists
developed a different vaccine, using the mouse brain passaged virus, coating it
with oil or egg yolk, freeze-drying the mixture, suspending it in saline, and
applying it with the smallpox vaccine by scariﬁcation. By 1945, sixteen million
Africans had been vaccinated with this combination and with few side effects.
The method originally developed by Theiler required large amounts of human
serum; since there was fear of the neurotropic effects, it was thus of limited use. By
the 1930s, cell culture had been introduced, and Theiler passaged the virus in chick
embryos lacking nervous tissue more than 100 times. This virus lost its neurot-
ropism in mice, due to random mutations. This strain, called 17D, had no side
effects, and became the vaccine of choice. By 1939, 1.3 million people had been
vaccinated in South America with the Theiler vaccine, without any side effects.
However, in 1941, 119 cases of encephalitis were reported, all of the infected
having received the vaccine from a single lot; this virus had apparently mutated
during sub-culture. Thus there arose the ‘‘seed lot’’ system, where original cultures
of the virus were stored for further use.
World War II saw a huge demand for the vaccine for the troops engaged in
North Africa. Between January 1941 and April 1942, 7 million doses were dis-
tributed. One batch of vaccine did have a serious side effect—there were 26,772
cases of jaundice that occurred about 60–120 days after the injection. The vaccine
contained a small amount of human serum for stabilization, and some batches were
contaminated with hepatitis B. It was thus decided to switch to a serum-free
vaccine and to give the vaccine only to those posted to a yellow fever area [6].
After further improvements, the 17D strain was adapted as the sole yellow fever
vaccine, and it is still used today.

Poliovirus
Tremendous efforts went into developing a polio vaccine in the 1940s and 1950s
(this is discussed in Chaps. 3 and 12). A major advance was the discovery that both
poliovirus and mumps virus could grow in mouse lung cells. Three major research
groups were involved in the development of a polio vaccine: those of Jonas Salk,
Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski. Unfortunately, there was bitter competition and
rivalry between the three groups. The ﬁrst vaccine licensed in the U.S. was Salk’s
inactivated polio vaccine (1955), in which the three strains of poliovirus were
inactivated by treatment with formalin. The development of this vaccine was a great
achievement, and Jonas Salk became a national hero. A second attenuated vaccine
containing all three strains of polio was tested and licensed in 1962. Two other
groups had independently produced an attenuated vaccine—one headed by Albert
Sabin, the other by Hilary Koprowski. A committee of the National Institutes of
Health decided on the Sabin vaccine, which consisted of the three mutated strains of
polio, extensively passaged in cell culture and mice. Hilary Koprowski had devel-
oped the ﬁrst attenuated poliovirus in 1950 and tested it on himself and on a group of
20 children in New York, with no side effects. Mass vaccination trials of the Ko-
prowski oral polio vaccine took place in the Belgian Congo, Poland, Croatia, and
Switzerland. By 1960, approximately 13 million individuals had been vaccinated
with the Koprowski polio vaccine and over 11 million with the Sabin vaccine [7].
The Salk vaccine is based on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney
(type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus),
grown in monkey kidney cell culture (Vero cell line), and the virus inactivated
with formalin. Initially, the Salk vaccine was the vaccine of choice in the U.S. In
1955, in the largest trial ever held, more than 400,000 children were vaccinated
with the Salk vaccine, which was 90 % effective against type II and type III polio,
and 60–70 % effective against type I. Large industrial facilities were built for the
production of the vaccine, which was exported to many countries. In 1955, in an
event known as the ‘‘Cutter’’ (Cutter was the name of one of the pharmaceutical
companies that produced the polio vaccine), some 120,000 doses of the Salk
vaccine were created, containing a live poliovirus instead of an inactive one. The
administration of this vaccine caused 40,000 cases of polio, with 53 cases of
paralysis and 5 deaths. The disease spread, creating a polio epidemic that lead to a
further 113 cases of paralytic polio and another 5 deaths. It has been called ‘‘one of
the worst pharmaceutical disasters in U.S. history;’’ [8] it of course affected the
public’s attitude towards the vaccine. In order for a vaccine to be successful, the
public has to have conﬁdence in it. In fact, the ‘‘Cutter Incident’’ led to the use of
an alternative vaccine (Sabin instead of Salk) for some time.
Many health advocates believed that the Sabin vaccine was a better vaccine,
since as a ‘‘live’’ vaccine, it provides ‘‘herd immunity’’—that is, virus is shed by
those being vaccinated—and it can spread throughout the family and provide
protection to the surrounding population. It was also assumed that the immunity
from the inactivated vaccine would not be long lasting, whereas the Sabin vaccine
366

Vaccines Against Viral Infections

virus multiplied in the gut, and would confer a stronger immune response. By 1968
the Sabin vaccine replaced the Salk vaccine. Since it was given orally rather than
by injection, it was easier for children to take and for parents to administer.
However there was a low, but steady number of individuals receiving the vaccine
who developed paralytic polio, indicating that the attenuated virus had undergone
mutation, or reverted to wild-type. By 2000 the US CDC recommended the Salk,
inactivated vaccine. In the WHO campaign to eradicate polio, the oral vaccine is
preferred, because of herd immunity. A map of the areas of the globe with endemic
polio is shown in Fig. 19.2 (a newer map would include Syria).
19.6
Measles
In the 1960s, vaccines were developed for mumps, rubella (German measles) and
measles, and in 1971 the combination of all three viruses (MMR vaccine) was
approved for use in the U.S. All three viruses are derived from attenuated strains
by passage through chicken eggs or cell culture, and were developed by Maurice
Hilleman of Merck Pharmaceuticals; in fact, Hilleman was responsible for the
development of 36 vaccines. Of the 14 vaccines routinely recommended in current
vaccine schedules, he developed eight: for measles, mumps, hepatitis A, hepatitis
B, chickenpox, meningitis, pneumonia and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae bacteria
(Wikipedia).

Measles is a very dangerous childhood disease, leading in some cases to death,
blindness, or hearing difﬁculties. Since the introduction of the vaccine, the number
of cases in the U.S. has fallen drastically (Fig. 19.3).
19.6.1
Measles Vaccine and Autism
In 1998 [9] a paper appeared in The Lancet, the inﬂuential British medical journal
claiming that the increase in cases of autism in children was linked directly to the
MMR vaccine. This was based on a study headed by Dr. Andrew Wakeﬁeld, a
British surgeon and specialist in diseases of the gastric tract. In particular, he
claimed to have found a correlation between irritable bowel syndrome, autism and
the vaccine. His conclusions were based on a study of 12 children. Most of the data
presented in the paper was anecdotal, on information from the parents as to when
the autistic symptoms ﬁrst appeared. In most cases this was said to have been
within a few weeks of the MMR inoculation. Dr. Wakeﬁeld published a follow-up
series of papers [10–12] claiming a direct relationship between the vaccine and
autism (and irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn’s disease). The papers were peer-
reviewed, many appearing in The Lancet or other inﬂuential peer-reviewed jour-
nals. The major argument presented was that (1) the vaccine overloaded the
immune system with viruses (three types), leading to an abnormal immune
response; (2) the injection of measles virus at such a young age altered the normal
immune response, resulting in aberrations of the immune system; and (3) that lack
of natural exposure to these viruses could lead to irritable bowel syndrome and

Crohn’s disease, both autoimmune diseases (although also known to be inherited).
These reports caused an uproar in the U.K., resulting in many parents refusing to
vaccinate their children; the effects were such that the level of MMR vaccination
dropped from 93 to 73 % in the U.K., and to 50 % in London.
Within a few years, large studies were performed to conﬁrm or refute Wake-
ﬁeld’s data. One of the largest was a Danish study with 537,303 children in the
cohort—children who had received MMR and children who had not received it
[13]. No correlation between the MMR vaccine and autism was detected. Other
studies quickly followed, showing similar results, although the Wakeﬁeld group
continued publishing the opposite conclusions. It was not until 2010 that 10 of 12
authors in the ﬁrst paper published in The Lancet [14] retracted their authorship,
claiming that they did not agree with the conclusions of the paper. Similar
retractions were made in other journals, but by then a great deal of damage had
been done. During this period, Wakeﬁeld stood by his results and claimed that
there was a conspiracy against him. What is astounding is that none of the co-
authors on the original paper realized that the data was wrong (or not statistically
correct) and that the retraction took so long. An investigation by the General
Medical Council of Great Britain found that many of the co-authors could not
identify which child was being discussed in the paper. Their names, with their
agreement, had been added to the authorship of the papers for the ﬂimsiest of
reasons; unfortunately, this is a common occurrence in science today.
The Wakeﬁeld case came to prominence due to the investigative reporting of
Brian Deer of the Times of London. Deer published his ﬁrst investigation into
Wakeﬁeld’s papers in 2004. He uncovered the possibility of research fraud,
unethical treatment of children, and Wakeﬁeld’s conﬂict of interest through his
involvement in a lawsuit against manufacturers of the MMR vaccine. Deer pub-
lished a summary of his work in the British Medical Journal in 2011 [15, 16]. He
interviewed each of the parents of the 12 (probably 13) children described in the
Wakeﬁeld paper, and found that the time of appearance of autism did not match
that reported in the 1998 paper, nor were the medical records reported correctly.
This is shown in Table 19.4.
The summary of the BMJ paper [9] is presented below:
‘‘The Lancet paper was a case series of 12 child patients; it reported a proposed
‘new syndrome’ of enterocolitis and regressive autism and associated this with
MMR as an ‘‘apparent precipitating event.’’ But in fact:’’
‘‘Three of nine children reported with regressive autism did not have autism
diagnosed at all. Only one child clearly had regressive autism.’’
‘‘Despite the paper claiming that all 12 children were ‘‘previously normal,’’ ﬁve
had documented pre-existing developmental concerns.’’
‘‘Some children were reported to have experienced ﬁrst behavioral symptoms
within days of MMR, but the records documented these as starting some months
after vaccination.’’
‘‘In nine cases, unremarkable colonic histopathology results—noting no or
minimal ﬂuctuations in inﬂammatory cell populations—were changed after a
medical school ‘research review’ to ‘non-speciﬁc colitis’.’’
19.6
Measles
369

‘‘The parents of eight children were reported as blaming MMR, but 11 families
made this allegation at the hospital. The exclusion of three allegations—all giving
times to the onset of problems in months—helped to create the appearance of a
14 day temporal link.
‘‘Patients were recruited through anti-MMR campaigners, and the study was
commissioned and funded for planned litigation.’’
As a scientist, it is difﬁcult to discern a motive for this falsiﬁcation of data. Was
it done out of greed? This does seem to be the case. All the shenanigans—creating
companies to show a linkage between MMR and autism and Crohn’s disease even
before the children described in the Lancet paper were hospitalized—are presented
in http://briandeer.com/mmr/lancet-summary.htm. Companies were created in
England, Ireland and in the U.S., patents were applied for, and money accepted
from charitable and government agencies on the basis of false data. The hospital
and institutions employing Wakeﬁeld were only too pleased to take their cuts.
‘‘Moreover,’’ Deer reported, ‘‘a lawyer planning to sue vaccine manufacturers
on behalf of parents who thought MMR caused their children’s problems retained
Wakeﬁeld as an expert witness 2 years earlier. The parents cited in the Lancet
article came to Wakeﬁeld‘s clinic in response to an advertising campaign led by
the lawyer’s group, called Jabs, and not for routine screening.’’ From the London
Times: ‘‘ANDREW WAKEFIELD, the former surgeon whose campaign linking
the MMR vaccine with autism, caused a collapse in immunization rates, was paid
more than £400,000 by lawyers trying to prove that the vaccine was unsafe.

The payments, unearthed by The Sunday Times, were part of £3.4 m distributed
from the legal aid fund to doctors and scientists who had been recruited to support
a now-failed lawsuit against vaccine manufacturers.
‘‘Critics this weekend voiced amazement at the sums, which they said created a
clear conﬂict of interest and were the ‘ﬁnancial engine’ behind a worldwide alarm
over the triple measles, mumps and rubella shot.
‘‘According to the ﬁgure, released under the Freedom of Information Act,
Wakeﬁeld was paid £435,643 in fees, plus £3,910 in expenses. Wakeﬁeld’s work
for the lawyers began 2 years before he published his now notorious report in The
Lancet medical journal in February 1998, proposing a link between the vaccine
and autism.’’
It is interesting that the Wakeﬁeld 1998 paper has been cited more than any
other retracted paper, over 700 times [10]. The vaccination rate in the U.K. has not
completely recovered’’.
19.7
Influenza
In the U,S,. the annual morbidity from inﬂuenza is estimated at between
25–50 million cases with 225,000 hospitalizations. The WHO, extrapolating from
these numbers, estimates that there are 1 billion cases of inﬂuenza annually, with
3–5 million severe cases and 300,000–500,000 deaths. Most of the deaths in the
U.S. are in the over-65 age group [11]. Chapter 11 presents the biological aspects
of the inﬂuenza virus. The major antigenic components of the virus are the
hemagglutinin protein and the neuraminidase protein, the major surface proteins of
the virus. As discussed in Chap. 11, the virus undergoes random mutation at a high
rate, resulting in antigenic drift. Reassortment and even mixing in the case of two
viruses of different origins results in antigenic shift, making it difﬁcult to predict
the makeup of the virus causing the seasonal outbreak of the ﬂu. The result of the
antigenic changes may mean that a population has no immunity to the virus, and
infection can result in a pandemic, as happened in 1918. The vaccine has to be
‘‘predictive’’ from year to year.
There are three types of inﬂuenza vaccine currently in circulation. One, con-
taining inactivated subunits of the virus, is given intramuscularly or intradermally;
the second is a live vaccine (LIAV live attenuated inﬂuenza vaccine) and is given
intranasally. Both vaccines are trivalent—that is, have three species of inﬂuenza
virus in the vaccine. A live attenuated cold adapted inﬂuenza virus can be
administered as a nasal vaccine. FluMist contains three cold-adapted H1N1,
H3N2, and B inﬂuenza. These are recombinant viruses containing a backbone of a
virus grown in the cold, with the incorporation of H and N genes from different
sources, and also inﬂuenza B. Mean shedding of the virus is for 7–8 days and
longer in children, thus having a herd effect. There have been no cases of illness
from this vaccine in the USA.
19.6
Measles
371

The CDC introduced a new vaccine this year. The quadrivalent ﬂu vaccine
protects against two inﬂuenza A viruses and two inﬂuenza B viruses. A standard
dose of quadrivalent ﬂu vaccine, given as a nasal spray, is approved for healthy
people aged 2–49; each year the vaccine changes according to predictions of the
type of inﬂuenza likely to be prevalent in a particular year. For 2013, the FDA
chose A/California/7/2009 (H1N1): A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2) and B/Wiscon-
sin/1/2010—two strains of inﬂuenza A and one strain of inﬂuenza B. People over
65 should get a new high dose inactivated virus vaccine annually. The strains for
the next year’s vaccine are chosen in February for use in the following season, and
vaccine production begins with strains carrying the ‘‘drifted’’ HA and NA genes of
the last season combined with reference strains that grow well in chick eggs. New
methods of producing vaccines, in which reverse genetics is used to copy genes,
which are inserted into plasmids, and then cloned back into a reference strains of
inﬂuenza have been developed. New technologies are required to produce sufﬁ-
cient inﬂuenza vaccines, and some are already being tried in various companies.
These include cell-based rather than egg-based live attenuated and inactive viral
vaccines as well as recombinant protein vaccines, where the genes for HA and NA
are cloned into baculovirus vectors and administered as puriﬁed proteins. Inﬂuenza
virus gene can also be cloned into other viral vectors such as vaccinia virus or
adenovirus and administered as either a replication-competent virus or defective
virus (Fig. 19.4). However, this creates problems discussed in the chapter on gene
therapy, where antibodies may inactivate such a virus. The development of an
inﬂuenza vaccine is to some extent a ‘‘guessing game,’’ since one cannot predict
the appearance of a novel strain of virus.

Rational Approach to Designing Vaccines
Vaccines fall into many categories. The majority of those discussed above are live
virus vaccines in which the virus has been attenuated either by multiple passages
through other animals or through multiple passages through cells in culture.
During passage, the virus undergoes mutation (particularly if it is an RNA virus) at
a very high rate, and the virus emerging is often attenuated. It should be possible to
rationally design mutations by in vitro mutagenesis. Inﬂuenza vaccines are made
by adapting the virus to grow at lower temperatures and could be made by per-
forming re-assortment in the laboratory to make attenuated strains (although
recombination in the laboratory might also produce viruses that are more patho-
genic). Another approach is to make recombinant vaccines using viral genes
produced in bacteria, yeast or baculovirus systems.
The vaccine for hepatitis B is a recombinant vaccine produced in yeast. In
Europe a second vaccine is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These
vaccines are very highly immunogenic and have few side effects. Large-scale
studies have been performed in at-risk patients, and antibody titers have been high.
The WHO—with the goal of eradicating HBV—has recommended a universal
vaccination program. In Taiwan and Italy, mass vaccination of infants has not only
decreased the incidence of HBV infection and the prevalence of chronic carriers,
but also the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Yeast and an insect virus, baculovirus, have also been used to produce the
human papilloma virus vaccine. Two vaccines have been developed; both are
highly immunogenic. Gardasil (Merck and Co.) is a quadrivalent vaccine against
HPV type 6, 12, 16 and 18, while Cervarix (Glaxo Smith Kline Biologicals) is
against HPV types 16 and 18. Both vaccines give excellent protection. Gardasil
also demonstrated strong protection against genital warts and anal cancers [12].
There has been some controversy surrounding the recommendations for pap-
illoma vaccination. The vaccines are recommended for girls and women aged 9–46
who have not been exposed to HPV. The vaccine has also been approved for men
and boys, with the CDC recommending it for boys as young as 9. There has been
fear expressed in the public and newspapers that giving the vaccine to teenagers
will encourage promiscuity.
Other alternatives proposed for the development of vaccines, include the use of
puriﬁed proteins, viral proteins expressed by prokaryotes, the use of synthetic
peptides and even DNA. Proteins from a variety of viruses have been cloned and
expressed in prokaryotes and cells in culture. Most have proven effective in mice
but have not been approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies. DNA vaccines,
coding for antigens from cancer or speciﬁc bacterium such as anthrax are delivered
as plasmids are delivered as plasmids or in harmless strains of E. coli. The major
problem with DNA vaccines has been a weak antigen response. The main method
of delivery is intramuscular injection or application to the skin with a gene gun
[13]. However, a large number of clinical trials with DNA vaccines are under way.

Vaccines from Plants
One of these days, it may be possible to eat lettuce and be vaccinated at the same
time, or receive antibodies against a bacterial or virus infection. It sounds like
science ﬁction, yet experimental trials of producing viral antigens are under way,
both in the research laboratory and in biotech companies, by introducing animal
viral genes into the plant genome, and into chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are small
organelles of prokaryotic origin that are responsible for photosynthesis in green
plants, analogous to mitochondria in higher organisms. Plant-derived vaccines (or
other biopharmaceuticals) are cheap to produce (compared to cell culture) and to
store, easy to scale up for mass production, and safer than those produced from
other sources, since there is less likelihood of contamination by bacteria or even
other viruses. Plant systems are much more economical than other industrial
systems for producing vaccines and would be ideal for Third World countries. For
example, it is estimated that to produce 100 million doses of inﬂuenza vaccine by a
conventional pharmaceutical company, such as Sanoﬁin Pennsylvania, would cost
$150 million per year. If Novartis were to produce 300 million doses, they would
charge $100 billion. Using tobacco plants, the cost would be $15 million per year
to produce one billion doses [14]. The technology is already available for the
puriﬁcation, if necessary, of the products, although the ultimate aim might be to
digest the vaccine (oral vaccine), despite the fact that precautions need to be taken
that the vaccine is not itself digested by stomach enzymes (this obviously does not
apply to tobacco plants). To date, the yield of products in experimental systems
such as tobacco or lettuce or grains has not been as great as expected; however, the
yield can be greatly enhanced by cloning the desired viral genes into chloroplasts,
which multiply in large numbers in the plant cell, thus enriching the product. An
HSV-2 vaccine has been produced in soybeans using a cauliﬂower mosaic virus
promoter [15]. This antibody was effective in preventing HSV-2 infection in a
mouse model and was indistinguishable from a monoclonal antibody produced in
cell culture. A whole series of monoclonal antibodies have been produced in a
variety of plants using plant virus vectors [16]. The hepatitis B envelope protein
has been produced in potatoes, lettuce, and lupines, and was immunogenic when
digested orally. The Norwalk virus capsid protein was also produced in potatoes
and tobacco plants and was immunogenic. The protein produced resembled empty
viral capsids (Table 19.5).
So far, the amount of foreign or viral proteins produced in the plants has not
been sufﬁcient for mass vaccination. This has led to further experimentation to
increase the yield by using various promoter sequences, and adding polyadenyl-
ation sites (as in mammalian tissue) to increase the yield. It is estimated that the
yield should be around 1 % of the total weight to make it of practical use. The
yield can be increased by using chloroplasts. There can be upto 10,000 copies of
chloroplasts per cell and result in the accumulation of 47 % of the total protein
being the recombinant protein. The desired genes are incorporated into the chlo-
roplast by recombination. Thus the cloned gene is surrounded on both sides by
374
19

chloroplast sequences. The method of transformation is quite different from that of
animal cells. Four- to six-week-old leaves are selected for transformation; DNA is
coated on the surface of microparticles of gold or tungsten and then shot onto the
leaf surface with great force, using a helium-driven particle delivery device (gene
gun).
Regeneration. Leaves are then cut into small leaf discs after 48 h of incubation
in the dark and put on selection media. Primary shoots generally arise within
4–6 weeks. Initially, a few copies of plastid genome are transformed and leaf cells
that are called heteroplastomic. Homoplastomy, a state where all copies of chlo-
roplast genome are transformed, is achieved by performing a few rounds of
regeneration under selection. The putative transgenic shoots are then further
characterized for transgene integration and protein expression [17].

HIV gag protein and dengue virus proteins have been produced in chloroplasts.
However, the product has not yet reached human clinical trials, although there has
been a large investment by U.S. government agencies. It may take a few more
years until we see clinical trials as production techniques are patented. However,
this may be the way of the future, producing cheap vaccines for most infectious
diseases. This method is now known in the ‘‘trade’’ as ‘‘molecular farming’’ and it
may be the answer to vaccine shortage; a number of biotech companies are now
pursuing this course. To quote from an announcement by Fraunhofer center for
molecular biotechnology (http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/press/research-news/2013/
june/automated-plant-factory-for-the-prodution-of-vaccines.htm)
regarding
one
such plant, ‘‘The plants grow in trays with hydroponic cultures of mineral wool as
opposed to soil, in specially designed growth modules. Light, water, and nutrients
are precisely dosed and distributed. Specially developed robots bring the plants
from station to station to carry out the various steps—from inserting the tiny seeds
and vacuum inﬁltration, to harvesting and extraction.
‘‘The plants grow for four weeks before the vector is introduced by means of
vacuum inﬁltration.’’ The process goes as follows: ‘‘A robot picks up a tray with
plants, turns it upside down, and submerges the tobacco plants headﬁrst into
water.’’ This water holds the vector (biological carrier) containing the genetic
information that tells the plants which protein they should produce. Then a vacuum
is applied by drawing the air from the water and the plants. As soon as we switch
off the vacuum, the plants suck in the water together with the vector. This takes
just a few seconds, and then the plants are put back in the growth module to grow
further. In about a week they have produced the proteins. Once harvested, the
leaves are cut into small pieces and homogenized in fully automated processes.
This produces a liquid from which the proteins are extracted. The end product is a
clear liquid.
‘‘The pilot facility is capable of producing up to 300 kg of biomass a month,
which roughly corresponds to 2.5 million units of vaccine.’’
Is this the future of vaccine production?

Emerging Viruses
Abstract
Emerging viruses are viruses that appear suddenly in the human population.
These are viruses to which man has no history of exposure and thus no or
limited immunity; they are not new evolutionary creations, but are viruses than
man meets due to environmental changes, such as deforestation, entering into
new habitats, or viruses that are transmitted from one species of animal to
humans. Most of these viruses are terrifying, and cause hemorrhagic fever, a
complete destruction of the circulation system; they include Lassa fever, Nipah
virus, Ebola, HIV, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and, recently,
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is the latest in a series of
‘‘new’’ respiratory viruses infecting man. It is possible that unknown emerging
viruses are the cause of death, often listed as ‘‘death due to an unknown cause,’’
as in the retrospective cases of HIV. Emerging viruses might also include
poliovirus and inﬂuenza, since their introduction into the human population is
(was) often sudden and due to changes in the environment or due to contact
with other animal species. For examples, polio was a result of changes in
sanitation in the countries of North America and Western Europe, and inﬂuenza
is constantly jumping from aquatic birds to man and other animal species where
genomic reassortment occurs.
20.1
Nipah and Hendra Viruses
An interesting constituent of epidemiology is the detective work to track down the
origins of novel viruses. An example of such investigative work is the exploration
into the origin of Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus, which caused an epidemic illness
in Malaysia in 1998. A mild disease occurred among pigs that eventually spread as
a severe, fatal disease to man and dogs. The ﬁrst outbreak was noted in 1998 in the

village of Ampang, where there were a number of cases of fatal encephalitis
among farmers, and respiratory infections and encephalitis among pigs. The dis-
ease spread to other parts of Malaysia with the movement of pigs for commercial
reasons. The outbreak was arrested by a mass cull, which began on March 20,
1999 and ended on April 26 of that year, with a ban on the movement of pigs [1,
2]. Malaysia had 2.4 million pigs and 1,800 pig farms in January 1999; by July 21,
1.1 million pigs and 956 farms had been destroyed and 48 more pig farms had
closed. In 1998 and 1999, there was a total of 265 conﬁrmed human cases of Nipah
virus and 105 human deaths. Infection with Nipah virus was associated with
encephalitis (inﬂammation of the brain), characterized by fever, drowsiness, and
more serious central nervous system symptoms, such as coma, seizures, and
inability to breathe. The virus also spread to cats, dogs, and even to ponies. There
have been no further outbreaks in Malaysia since then.
Other outbreaks of Nipah virus have occurred in humans in Bangladesh in
2004, with 75 % fatalities, [3] and in India. At the time of this outbreak, there was
no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The outbreak was not associated
with pigs, but with the consumption of date palm sap that had been contaminated
with fruit-bat droppings. A more severe outbreak occurred in 2012 in Bangladesh
where there was evidence of human-to-human transmission, and transmission
through fomites or the handling of the dead bodies [4]. From 2001 to 2012 there
were 280 cases of Nipah virus infections in humans, with 211 deaths—a mortality
rate of 75 %.
Where did this virus come from and how did it arise? In some cases these
outbreaks have been associated with land clearing for agricultural purposes. The
affected area of Malaysia had been cleared of jungle and planted with fruit trees.
These fruit trees were attractive to a particular species of bats known as ‘‘ﬂying
foxes (Fig. 20.1)’’. They in turn sprinkled the areas with their droppings into areas
foraged by pigs; the droppings contained the virus, which was infectious to pigs
and other mammals. Although the bats contained viral antigens and antibodies,
they were healthy. Thus there was a chain of events, triggered by land clearing,
that resulted in a novel virus infection. In fact, it has been hypothesized that the

clearing of virgin forests, as is being done in the Amazon, may also result in new
infections in man as wildlife attempts to ﬁnd new habitats.
A similar related virus, Hendra virus (Hendra is a suburb of Brisbane, Aus-
tralia), affected horses, pigs, and livestock in Australia. There have been a number
of occurrences conﬁned to horses, and to three humans working with horses. Two
of the three humans infected had respiratory illness with severe ﬂu-like symptoms
and
died.
(For

http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/
mnpages/dispages/nipah.htm.)
Both of these viruses are paramyxoviruses belonging to a new genus called
henipavirus. The Hendra virus was ﬁrst isolated in 1996, and the Nipah virus in
1999. Figure 20.2 shows the range of spread of Pteropus (ﬂying fruit bats) and the
sites of outbreaks of Nipah virus and Hendra virus. The National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has developed an effective vaccine
against both viruses.
20.2
Ebola Virus
Ebola outbreaks occur with ferocity and suddenness, and with high mortality; they
may originate from bats, and the virus spreads easily to a susceptible human popu-
lation. Ebola is the most lethal human viral infection known, First identiﬁed in 1976
in Zaire and the Sudan, it causes hemorrhagic fever (internal bleeding) with a
mortality rate of 88 %. The ﬁrst recorded outbreak killed 280 out of 318 cases in
Zaire, and 151 out of 284 cases in the Sudan. The disease spread very rapidly among

hospital personnel treating the sick, and among the general population through
contact with ill persons, handling the dead, and reuse of needles. Because there is a
danger of infection in preparing the dead for burial, there arose the practice of
burning the bodies and the huts where the victims had lived; therefore, strict pre-
cautions are necessary for handling Ebola infections. A subtype of Ebola, known as
Ebola Reston, occurred among monkeys imported from the Philippines in the state of
Virginia and later in Texas, in 1990 and 1992. Luckily this strain was non-pathogenic
for humans although some handlers did develop antibodies to the virus [5, 6]. During
the 1990s there were fatal outbreaks of Ebola in the Congo; in one case, 16 people
became sick from eating a chimpanzee found dead in the jungle. Other cases have
involved an index case among hunters and among people associated with hunting

Fig. 20.3 The ecology of Ebola virus (CDC). This graphic shows the life cycle of the
ebolavirus. Bats are strongly implicated as both reservoirs and hosts for the ebolavirus. Of the ﬁve
identiﬁed ebolavirus subtypes, four are capable of human-to-human transmission. Initial
infections in humans result from contact with an infected bat or other wild animal. Strict
isolation of infected patients is essential to reduce onward ebolavirus transmission

primates. Sizeable outbreaks occurred in Uganda in 2000–2001, with 425 cases and a
mortality rate of 53 %. Table 20.1 lists the major outbreaks since 1976 (source: CDC
Ebola resources) (Fig. 20.3 illustrates the ecology as known, of the virus and
Fig. 20.4 illustrates the unusual structure of the virus).
The three most important risks associated with Ebola virus infection were
attending funerals of Ebola patients, having contact with the sick in one’s family,
and providing medical care to Ebola patients without using adequate personal

protective measures [7, 8]. At the time of this writing (2014), there are outbreaks
of Ebola in the Congo and Uganda. The disease also infects and is fatal for non-
human primates such as monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. According to the
CDC and WHO, the zoonose origin of Ebola is still unknown, although bats are
suspect in this case and also in a similar disease, Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
Figure 20.5 presents the distribution of Ebola on the African continent.
Ebola virus belongs to a family of viruses known as ‘‘ﬁloviruses.’’ This is a
long, 970 nm ﬁlamentous negative-stranded RNA virus (Fig. 20.2). The viral
proteins inhibit interferon activity. The viral RNA codes for 7–8 proteins.
20.3
SARS
SARS ﬁrst appeared in 2002. Between November 2002 and July 2003 there were
approximately 800 cases in southern China, with a death toll of 10 %. The major
‘‘hot spot’’ was Hong Kong, with 9 % fatality, but within a few months SARS
spread worldwide, carried by unsuspecting travelers. The range and the speed of
worldwide transmission are very well documented. (A day-to-day account of the
epidemic is presented both at http://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/timeline.htm
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_of_the_SARS_outbreak.)
In the days before air transport, it may have been conﬁned to this area of
southern China.
The infectious virus was identiﬁed as a coronavirus in 2003 (Fig. 20.6).
SARS typically begins with ﬂu-like signs and symptoms—fever, chills, muscle
aches and occasionally diarrhea. After about a week, signs and symptoms include
fever of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher, dry cough, and shortness of breath.
The SARS epidemic (or pandemic) showed how quickly infection can spread in
a highly mobile and interconnected world. The SARS epidemic also showed how
international cooperation among health care experts can effectively contain the

spread of the disease. Since 2004, known instances of SARS transmission have
fallen to zero worldwide.
The virus spread from southern China to Singapore, Taiwan, the U.S. and
Canada (Ontario). To date, there is no vaccine against SARS; however, the passive
transfer of antibodies inhibits the virus. If an outbreak is suspected, patients should
be quarantined, and a strict regimen of sterility enforced. Most important is for
health care workers to avoid contact with the patients, to wear surgical masks, and
to regularly wash their hands.
The detective work involved in tracking the SARS epidemic is fascinating in its
extensiveness and detail. Every case appears to have been followed and docu-
mented (see references to CDC and Wikipedia above).
The ﬁrst case of SARS appeared to have been a farmer from the Guangdong
area of China (that borders Hong Kong). The Chinese authorities reported the
outbreak to the WHO, with 305 cases (including 105 health care workers) and ﬁve
deaths. This may have been an underestimate of the severity of the outbreak [9].
The ﬁrst clue of the outbreak appears to be on November 27, 2002, when Canada’s
Global Public Health International Network (GPHIN), an electronic warning
system that is part of the World Health Organization’s Global Outbreak and Alert
Response Network (GOARN), picked up reports of a ‘‘ﬂu outbreak’’ in China
through Internet media monitoring and analysis, and the data was forwarded to the
WHO. Most news media in China did not report the extent of the outbreak, in
keeping with the government’s policy of not reporting bad news. This hindered the
treatment and the recognition that this was a major new epidemic illness. The
illness spread extremely quickly, primarily among health care workers and phy-
sicians attending to the sick. What is rather amazing is the speed with which the
virus was sequenced, recognized, and brought under control by quarantine and
international cooperation. Scientists are still puzzled as to how 64-year-old Dr. Liu
Jianlun could have transferred—during his brief stay—the virus to 16 other
occupants of the same ﬂoor of his hotel. These guests subsequently travelled to
other destinations, including Toronto, Vietnam, and Singapore, thus spreading the
virus. In less than 4 months, some 4,000 cases and 550 deaths from SARS outside
of China can be traced to this one visit to the Metropol Hotel. (The hotel is
considering turning the 9th ﬂoor, where Dr. Jianlun stayed, into a museum.) [10].
It took about 5 months from the initial outbreak for the Chinese authorities to
allow physicians from the WHO to visit Guodong province, and to admit to the
seriousness of the epidemic. Once admitted, the Chinese authorities carried out
Draconian measures to bring the infection under control, even ﬁring the mayor and
health minister in Beijing. This was followed by mass quarantine of hospital
wards, under armed guards, and threat of execution of anyone knowingly having
SARS and avoiding quarantine. However, these measures and international
cooperation stopped the epidemic from spreading.
SARS did have grave economic consequences. It substantially damaged the
tourist trade in Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as in Toronto. Taiwan in part
blamed the recession in that island on the SARS outbreak (Fig. 20.7).
386
20
Emerging Viruses

The identiﬁcation of the virus occurred rapidly following the initial outbreak of
the infection. The isolate (initially unknown whether viral or not, but at one time
suspected of being Chlamydia) [9] was grown in culture and tested against sera
from recovering individuals and uninfected controls. The virus was inhibited by
their sera, thus allowing for a diagnostic test to be developed. However, at this
early stage it was impossible to identify the virus. The virus was later identiﬁed as
a previously unknown corona virus. Corona viruses normally cause symptoms of a
cold, and take about 10 days’ incubation to manifest. In this case, the long incu-
bation period helped the spread of the virus.
Where did the virus come from? Initial testing indicated that the virus came
from civets (a member of the cat family), a food delicacy in China and found in the
open markets. Further analysis of civets in the wild did not ﬁnd traces of the virus.
Thus the civets in the market must have also been ‘‘dead-end’’ victims of SARS. In
2005 two teams of researchers reported the presence of similar corona viruses in
Chinese horseshoe bats. These are probably the culprits, and the virus was prob-
ably passed on through an intermediate host in the market. Using DNA sequencing
techniques (although this is an RNA virus), scientists have been able to work out
the relationship between the virus discovered in humans, bats, and civets [11, 12].

and_Deaths.pdf
20.3
SARS
387

There seems to be no doubt that bats carry many species of corona viruses
similar in sequence to SARS. A phylogenic tree shows that civet and human SARS
viruses are very similar and, most importantly, that both are nested within a clade
of bat viruses—so the ancestor of the civet and human strains seems to have been a
bat virus! Based on this evidence, biologists have come up with a plausible path of
transmission: infected bats and uninfected civets came into contact at a market, the
virus was transmitted to civets and then multiplied and evolved in civets (or other
animals) in the public market, until eventually the virus hopped over to humans. It
is apparent that many of the ‘‘emerging’’ viruses can be linked back to bats
(including Nipah and possibly Ebola viruses).
20.4
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Virus
Since September 2012 another virus (HCoV-EMC/2012, later known as MERS,
for MERS virus, has been affecting people in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, nearby coun-
tries, and even some European countries [13]. As of this writing (March 2014),
MERS has infected 186 people and killed 81. It appears to be a corona virus
related to SARS, causing severe pneumonia and kidney failure. Part of the virus
has been sequenced and compared with other corona viruses. Once again, this
virus appears to have originated in bats and spread to humans, either directly or
through an intermediate host. Bats in Saudi Arabia contain many different corona
viruses. It was possible to isolate a virus with nucleotide sequences identical to that
in an infected patient in one case [14]. The virus does appear in clusters and there
is human-to-human transmission. The fatality rate is high—over 30 %. It has been
traced to an Egyptian tomb bat, with the sequence of the viral RNA identical to
that of the index case.
Thus, this virus appears to be genetically related to the SARS virus. Recent
evidence suggests that dromedary camels found in southern Oman may have also
been infected in the past with the MERS virus, since antibodies to components of
the virus have been found in the sera of such animals, but there is no evidence that
this is the source of the current epidemic.
20.5
HantaVirus
Hantavirus causes a severe respiratory infection and is transmitted by a variety of
different rodents, mostly mice. The name comes from the Hantan River in South
Korea. The virus caused an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever among American and
Korean troops during the Korean War of 1951–1953, with more than 3,000 troops
being sick with kidney failure and internal bleeding; the mortality rate was 10 %. The
virus was not isolated until 1976 and found in a striped ﬁeld mouse [15] and urban rats.
This disease was ﬁrst recognized in the U.S. (Four Corners Disease) in 1993.
An unexplained pulmonary (lung) illness occurred in an area shared by Arizona,
New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. Quite a number of previously healthy young
388
20
Emerging Viruses

adults died from an acute respiratory infection; the outbreak was related to an
increase in crop yield with a concomitant increase in the deer mouse population.
The virus was isolated from a deer mouse captured close to the home of one of the
victims, and identiﬁed as a new virus, ﬁrst called ‘‘Muerto Canyon virus,’’ but later
changed to ‘‘Sin Nombre virus’’ (SNV). Why did this outbreak occur in 1993?
Previous years had seen periods of drought, and not enough food to maintain a
large deer mouse population. In 1993 there was plenty of rain and snow, and thus
the plant yield was greater than usual. It is estimated that the deer mouse popu-
lation grew tenfold during this period, and thus had more contact with humans
[16]. Since the initial outbreak of Hantavirus, other strains of the virus have been
identiﬁed that have not been associated with the Four Corners states [17]. This is
probably not a new virus; the Navajo Indians of the region appeared to be familiar
with a respiratory infection that was associated with increases in the mouse
population. Certain strains of Hantavirus can be transmitted between humans.
Hantaviruses have now been identiﬁed in large areas of the U.S., all carried by
different rodents. [These rodents are described in http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/
rodents/white-footed-mouse.html (Fig. 20.8).]
Since November 2012 there have been 10 conﬁrmed cases of Hantavirus
infection in Yosemite National Park, with three fatalities. From the CDC website:
‘‘NPS public health ofﬁcials believe that 9 of the 10 people with conﬁrmed han-
tavirus infection were exposed to the virus while staying at the Signature Tent
Cabins in Curry Village in Yosemite National Park. The other park visitor with
Hantavirus infection was probably exposed to the virus while hiking or staying at
the High Sierra Camps, located about 15 miles from Curry Village. Some of the
infected cabins have now been destroyed.’’ (An interesting article on the Yosemite
outbreak can be found at http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/north-
america/united-states/national-parks/Death-at-Yosemite-The-Story-Behind-Last-
Summers-Hantavirus-Outbreak.html.)
The Hantavirus belongs to the family of Bunyaviridae, a single-stranded RNA
virus with a segmented genome. The virus encodes four to six proteins.

20.6
Lassa Fever
There are many other types of hemorrhagic fever viruses, not as lethal as Ebola,
but still very dangerous. These include the arena viruses, a large class of viruses
that include Lassa fever, and other hemorrhagic fever viruses named for their
countries of origin, such as Bolivian, Venezuelan, and Brazilian hemorrhagic
fevers; these viruses are associated with rats and mice (Fig. 20.9). They do not
cause obvious illness in the rodent population and the virus is shed in the urine or
droppings of the rodents. The virus can be inhaled as an aerosol, or in some cases
transferred by person-to-person contact, as discussed above for Ebola. Lassa virus
was ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1969 when two missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West
Africa. The virus causes signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. It is endemic in
western Africa and the estimates are of between 100,000 and 300,000 infections
per year. The mortality rate varies between 5–25 %, depending on the outbreak.
Many more may be infected without symptoms. The reservoir, or host, of Lassa
virus is a rodent known as the ‘‘multimammate rat’’ of the genus Mastomys. This is
a small rat that lives among humans in large areas of West, Central and East
Africa. The virus is spread in the droppings and urine of the rats, and may be
picked up in dust. The rats are often consumed as food, and if infected, trans-
mission to humans may occur during handling. Human-to-human transmission
may also occur through body ﬂuids and sexual transmission, since the virus can be
found in semen. Eradicating the rats, storing food in rodent-proof containers,
trapping and removing the animals and avoiding them for food, can control the

virus. However, the population of rats is so great that annihilation of the population
is very difﬁcult.
Lassa fever belongs to the genus of viruses known as ‘‘arenavirus.’’ Five are-
naviruses are known to cause human illness: Lassa virus, Junin virus, Machupo
virus, Guanarito virus and Sabia virus. The structure of the nucleic acid is rather
unusual, in that it is segmented, each piece of opposite polarity. Both segments are
ambisense. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) binds to a promoter on
each encapsidated segment, and transcribes a messenger RNA. Transcription is
terminated by a strong hairpin sequence at the end of each gene. mRNAs are
capped, probably by L protein during synthesis. An ambisense genome is one in
which both nucleic acid strands encode for proteins (Fig. 20.9).
20.7
West Nile Virus
Mosquitoes or other insects transmit many ‘‘emerging’’ viruses. Recently there
have been outbreaks in the U.S. of West Nile virus, a virus carried by mosquitoes
and transmitted to birds and often to humans. West Nile virus was ﬁrst isolated
from a feverish woman in the West Nile District of Uganda in 1937. The ecology
was characterized in Egypt in the 1950s. The virus became recognized as a cause
of severe human meningitis or encephalitis (inﬂammation of the spinal cord and
brain) in elderly patients during an outbreak in Israel in 1957. An equine form of
the disease was ﬁrst noted in Egypt and France in the early 1960s. WNV ﬁrst
appeared in North America in 1999, with encephalitis reported in humans and
horses. Since then there have been a large number of cases of WNV in birds and in

humans, and it is now considered one of the most widespread of the ‘‘emerging
viruses.’’ The virus has now spread globally with new strains being identiﬁed in
2012 (Fig. 20.10).

West Nile Virus

The virus is transmitted in a bird-mosquito cycle, with humans being consid-
ered dead- end hosts (Fig. 20.11). The major birds infected include the American
crow, blue jays, black-billed magpies, and less commonly, robins and house
sparrows. West Nile virus is a reportable infection and the CDC has tracked the
number of cases in humans according to state (Table 20.2).
Numbers ﬂuctuate from year to year after a large increase in 2002. In 2012,
Texas had the most cases. The virus is carried by birds and transmitted by mos-
quitoes. It is estimated that 20 % of the people who become infected will develop
West Nile fever, leaving 80 % of those infected not experiencing any type of
illness. It is also estimated that 1 in every 150 persons infected with West Nile
virus will develop a more severe form of the disease. In 2012 the virus killed 286
people in the U.S., with Texas being the hardest hit. Those who survive enceph-
alitis may have permanent neurological damage. The virus has been found in
almost all rodents in the U.S., so when controlling this disease it is important to
control mosquito populations. It is also important to wear protective clothing and
to spray clothing and the body with mosquito repellent. West Nile virus is not
transmitted from human to human (see Fig. 20.5); it is a ﬂavivirus, the same class
as yellow fever and hepatitis C. Its mode of replication is similar to that of those
two viruses. Figure 20.12 is a summary ﬁgure of the known emerging viruses as of
2012.

Manufacturing Viruses
Abstract
The manufacturing of viruses in the test tube begins with the observations that
viral capsid proteins undergo self-assembly when ionic and pH conditions are
suitable. Components of Escherichia coli phage, such as T4 and k, assemble
spontaneously to form whole phage particles, and components of icosahedral
viruses in the presence or absence of nucleic acid form spherical structures.
Viral RNA was copied by the reverse transcriptase into cDNA and expressed on
a plasmid with the formation of intact virus. By 2002, poliovirus was
synthesized from full-length cDNA. With the progress in technology for the
synthesis of long stretches of DNA and improvements in sequencing, it was a
natural next step to construct a virus in a cell-free system using commercially
available DNA. Poliovirus and Qb bacteriophage were synthesized in vitro;
similar techniques were used to sequence and reconstitute the 1918 ﬂu
pandemic virus, and to modify the host range of avian inﬂuenza virus. These
latter experiments were criticized as being dangerous to humans and to the
environment, and new regulations were introduced to control such experiments.
21.1
Development of In Vitro Techniques for Virus Assembly
In 2002, a controversial paper was published in Science [1] announcing the full
in vitro synthesis of the poliovirus in a cell-free extract, devoid of ribosomes,
mitochondria and nuclei. This was performed using cDNA (complementary DNA)
manufactured synthetically from the known sequence of the viral RNA. Some
condemned the paper as irresponsible, as a recipe for terrorists, as a stunt, or an
ego trip, while others hailed it as a major scientiﬁc breakthrough.

This scientiﬁc advance is part of a natural progression in the ﬁeld of virology,
starting with the research in the 1960s of creating phage T4 in vitro from com-
ponents that underwent self-assembly [2]. When phage components—such as
phage heads, tails, and tail ﬁbers—were mixed in a cell-free extract, whole phage
particles were made. This was done by using temperature-sensitive mutants of
phage blocked in the assembly of one component, and mixing them with extracts
from phage blocked in a second component. The original experiments were per-
formed with phage T4 (Fig. 21.1) and phage k [3]. T4 assembly to the intact phage
does require scaffolding proteins, and the packaging of the DNA into the phage
head does need an energy source, ATP. However, the head and tail assembly
occurs spontaneously, without other interactions.
Small icosahedral viral capsid proteins, such as those of picornavirus, undergo
self-assembly when the concentration reaches a critical mass, and the pH and salt
concentrations are optimum. During picornavirus replication (poliovirus, mengo-
virus, or bovine enterovirus), subviral particles containing subunits of the capsid
proteins can be found and isolated. Such subviral particles will self-assemble and
form empty capsids with icosahedral structures identical to whole virus particles as
viewed by electron microscopy [4]. Similar studies of self-assembly of capsid
proteins and nucleic acid were performed with cowpea chlorotic mottle virus and
brome mosaic virus. In both cases, viable infectious virus was created in vitro by
mixing capsid protein and nucleic acid [5, 6].
It can be argued that in vitro self-assembly of viruses was ﬁrst shown in the
elegant experiments of Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat with tobacco mosaic virus and
Holmes’ ribgrass virus. Viral nucleic acid was mixed with the coat proteins of the

respective viruses and the nucleic acid was packaged in vitro. However, the purpose
of these experiments was to prove that RNA was the genetic material and that TMV
RNA could be packaged in Holmes’ ribgrass coat protein and reverse [7].
A major advance occurred when Taniguchi et al. [8] showed that it was possible
to make a full-length DNA copy of a phage RNA using reverse transcriptase (the
enzyme found in retroviruses). Phage Qb is a phage of RNA with a length of
approximately 4,500 nucleotides, about half that of poliovirus RNA. The RNA
was copied into positive and negative strands and cloned into a plasmid (a small
circular piece of DNA that replicates in a bacterial system) and transformed
(inserted) into Escherichia coli HB101. The resulting transfection produced full-
length and active Qb virus. Although the nucleotides were not chemically syn-
thesized but rather through enzymatic reactions, this was the in vitro synthesis of a
viral genome using reverse genetics. The concepts and techniques developed in the
Weissmann laboratory could be adapted to the synthesis of any RNA virus into
DNA, with the incorporation of alternative nucleotides to create mutants. Both
positive- and negative-stranded RNA can be copied into cDNA. In the case of a
positive-stranded RNA virus, the cDNA is transfected directly into the host cell to
produce virus. In the case of negative-stranded RNA, the cDNA is cloned into a
plasmid under the control of a cellular promoter (regulatory sequence), which in
turn is added to the host cell to produce virus. Similar studies were initiated with
the human pathogen, poliovirus [9, 10], with double-stranded cDNA copies of
polio being cloned into a commonly used E. coli plasmid (pBR322). The full-
length virus (representing 7,440 nucleotides) was ligated together from three
segments that were generated, using reverse transcriptase. When this cDNA clone
was transfected into HeLa cells, infectious virus was produced. The virus produced
by this method was identical to wild-type virus.
Thus it is possible to use in vitro mutagenesis to construct site-speciﬁc mutants
and pose essential questions on viral replication and viral virulence. Utilizing
reverse genetics, full-length infectious cDNA has been made from a large number
of different viruses, including rabies, respiratory syncytial virus, measles, Ebola,
Bunyavirus, and even segmented viruses such as reovirus and inﬂuenza A. This
research is summarized in [11]. These constructs can be used to develop novel
vaccines and to study virus replication and assembly in detail. However, it is
important to emphasize that all were made with naturally occurring RNA or DNA.
21.2
DNA Synthesis
In parallel with these studies, there were major developments in the techniques of
synthesizing DNA in vitro. DNA synthesis was initially expensive, only short
fragments could be synthesized, and it was time consuming. The ﬁrst DNA
sequence of biological importance synthesized in vitro was the DNA sequence
coding for the alanine tRNA of yeast and later the tyrosine suppressor tRNA
from E. coli. The ﬁrst was a 75-base pair sequence, and the second a 207-base

pair [12, 13]. Their synthesis was hailed as major biological (biochemical)
breakthroughs. When I was a graduate student, I remember the excitement gen-
erated by the work of Har Gobind Khorana in announcing their synthesis; Khorana
received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1968 together with Marshall Nirenberg
and Robert Holley for work showing how triplet nucleotides formed the genetic
code. He also developed the methodology for the synthesis of what at that time
was considered long oligonucleotide sequences [14]. Since then, the speed and
cost of synthesizing DNA sequences have decreased substantially, and commercial
companies now perform DNA (oligonucleotide) synthesis.
In the year 2000, it cost $12 per base pair to synthesize oligonucleotides under
special arrangement, so that it cost approximately $85,000–$100,000 to synthesize
the genome of polio virus [1]. Today it costs about $5,000. Figures 21.1 and 21.2
demonstrate the decline in the costs of synthesizing DNA and of sequencing DNA.
In Fig. 21.1, the cost of generating DNA sequences using Sanger-based chemis-
tries and capillary-based instruments (‘‘ﬁrst-generation’’ sequencing platforms)
shows a slow decline up to 2007. Beginning in January 2008, the data represent the
costs of generating DNA sequence using ‘‘second-generation’’ (or ‘‘next-genera-
tion’’) sequencing platforms. The change in instruments represents the rapid
evolution of DNA sequencing technologies that occurred in recent years. To
exemplify the nature of the reductions in DNA sequencing costs, each graph also
shows hypothetical data reﬂecting Moore’s Law, which describes a long-term
trend in the computer hardware industry that involves the doubling of ‘‘computing
power’’ every 2 years. Technological improvements that keep up with Moore’s
Law are widely regarded to be doing exceedingly well, making it useful for
comparison. Figure 21.2 represents the decline in the cost of sequencing over the

years; this also fell drastically with the introduction of newer sequencing methods
and technologies. The data in Table 21.1 makes it even clearer. In September 2001
it cost $5,292 to sequence a megabase (1 million base pairs) DNA; as of April
2013, the cost was 6¢ (Fig. 21.3).
With the cost of creating a viral genome under $10,000, we have entered a
‘‘brave new world’’ of virology. This is obviously a bonanza for viral research as
well as a danger that viral genetic material may easily fall into the wrong hands. It
allows virologists to develop custom-made viruses—that is, alterations in
sequences to explore pathology and relationships between gene and structure as
well as to easily construct attenuated viruses for vaccines.
The original method, known as the Sanger method, was the method of choice
until a few years ago. In 2005, a new method of sequencing was begun; it was
called ‘‘cyclic array sequencing.’’ This dramatically reduced the cost and speed of
sequencing. The cost of sequencing a whole human genome dropped from the
millions of dollars to approximately $10,000, so that both the cost of obtaining the
full sequence and the manufacture of the DNA is considerably less.
21.3
Viruses Produced In Vitro Without a Natural Template
(Until 2013)
Obviously, construction of a viral genome requires knowledge of the sequence of
that genome. How many viral genomes are there? At the time of writing this
chapter, the NIH Genome Repository contains the sequences of 3,570 complete
viral genomes, including animal viruses, bacteriophage, plant viruses, and satellite
viruses. These range in size from the mimivirus with 1,181,404 base pairs to Qb
with 4,215 base pairs.
The ﬁrst virus synthesized from commercially available synthetic DNA outside
a living cell was poliovirus. To correct a misconception, the virus is formed from
synthetic DNA as described. The DNA was added to a cell-free extract (that is, an
extract derived from cells, but without nuclei or mitochondria), but that contains
ribosomes, which are required for protein synthesis. This was a step different from
previous work performed by the same group, in which cDNA was made from a
viral template and transfected into cells to produce replicating wild-type virus. In
one, the virus is made in a test tube; in the other, the virus is made in a cell. The
virus produced in this artiﬁcial cell-free system appeared to be similar to wild-type
virus except for subtle changes made to distinguish it from possible contaminants.
The synthesis of poliovirus did not require living cells. Subsequent to its chemical
synthesis, the cDNA was transcribed in vitro into infectious viral RNA that, in turn,
yielded infectious polio upon incubation in an extract of non-infected HeLa cells
(Fig. 21.4). For the chemist, therefore, poliovirus is nothing more than a chemical.
When the virus enters a cell, however, it has a program for survival. It will subvert
cellular compartments and turn them into viral factories, in which it will proliferate
subject to the evolutionary laws—heredity, genetic variation, selection toward

rules that apply to living entities. One could even argue that poliovirus has sex in the
infected cell, as it readily recombines with sibling progeny or with related viruses
should they co-infect the same cell. This fascinating dual nature of viruses as
nonliving and living entities that is, an existence as chemicals with a life cycle—has

been largely ignored in response to the chemical and biochemical synthesis of
poliovirus, which was published in 2002 [11].
However, when this manufactured poliovirus was injected into the brains of
mice containing the polio virus receptor, it was found to be greatly attenuated.
When tested on human neuroblastoma cells, the virus had a temperature-sensitive
phenotype. Speciﬁc changes had been made in sequences considered non-essential
in the manufactured sequence to act as proof that this was the original recon-
structed virus and not a wild-type contaminant. These changes were for identiﬁ-
cation purposes only. This attenuation was found to be due to a UA-to-GG
exchange at nucleotides 102/103, mapping to a region between the cloverleaf-like
structure and the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 50-nontranslated region
of the viral genome, not previously considered important. Thus, this simple switch
altered the characteristics of the virus, and led in fact to a virus with oncolytic
potential, a fortuitous ﬁnding [15].
21.4
In Vitro Synthesis of Bacteriophage /X174
The ﬁrst bacteriophage to be produced ‘‘artiﬁcially’’ was the bacteriophage /X174
[16]. This virus consists of a single-stranded circular DNA of 5,386 nucleotides
and its in vitro synthesis was universally hailed as a great scientiﬁc success. It was
produced in the laboratory of Craig Venter, who had previously announced the ﬁrst
full sequence of the human genome, and it was to be the prototype for larger
genomes. Designing the oligonucleotides for the /X174 virus only took about
eight hours, and the actual synthesis about four days. Figure 21.5 illustrates the
steps required to manufacture the virus, which was tested for infectivity and was
identical to wild-type. There was no discussion after the announcement of this
virus construct of the possible dangers inherent in ‘‘manufacturing’’ such a virus.
The main thrust of the research was to show the feasibility of the technology.
21.5
Expanding the Host Range of Influenza Virus
One of the most exciting developments in virology was the resurrection of the
1918 pandemic inﬂuenza virus. This is discussed in detail in Chap. 11. Using
reverse genetics, the total RNA sequence of this virus (eight segments) was copied
into cDNA and used to infect human cells, thereby recreating the deadly virus.
Segments of this virus were mixed with segments from other inﬂuenza viruses and
the virulence tested to pinpoint the modiﬁcations responsible for virulence. This
work was criticized, since the total sequence of each gene was published, and the
virus could thus be manufactured by anyone with skills in molecular biology.
Since the 1918 strain itself was recreated, even with the safeguards of a high
security laboratory, it is feasible that the virus could accidently escape from the
laboratory and infect the human population.

Expanding the Host Range of Influenza Virus
407

As discussed in the chapter on inﬂuenza (Chap. 11), the world is currently
experiencing two pandemics of inﬂuenza infecting poultry, with sporadic trans-
mission to humans. One of these strains, H5N1, has been manipulated in the
laboratory to increase its host range. The ﬁrst experiment of this type was per-
formed in The Netherlands, where the H5N1 virus was mutated by site-directed
mutagenesis and passaged through ferrets. Ferrets are the optimum model system
and are infected by inﬂuenza in a manner similar to the way humans are infected.
As a result of these experiments, strains of virus were isolated that could be
transmitted by aerosol [17]. This was a result of further mutation in vivo (antigenic
drift) and not a result of reassortment. In particular, mutations occurred in the
polymerase gene, an unexpected result. The virus was not lethal for the ferrets, but
could be detected by titration and PCR. Four amino acid substitutions occurred in
the hemagglutinin gene and one in the polymerase complex. The authors point out
that this virus could be a risk for humans and acquire changes allowing for
human-to-human transmission. A second study, done simultaneously, had similar
ﬁndings. These researchers [18] identiﬁed a reassorted H5N1 virus—comprising
H5 HA (from an H5N1 virus) with four mutations and the remaining seven-gene
segments from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. The virus produced was capable of
droplet transmission in a ferret model.

Both groups argued that such studies would deﬁne the changes that might occur
to make this a pandemic virus for humans, and could be useful in studying and
developing treatment in such a pandemic. As expected, this ﬁnding has been
severely criticized. If such viruses escaped from the laboratory, they could be
dangerous, and even though the virus was not lethal to the ferrets, it could be
dangerous in the hands of terrorists or as a biological weapon. Many are ques-
tioning whether the research was necessary, and both papers were held up to
scrutiny by the National Safety Board of the U.S. and Holland, where some of the
work was performed. I personally am not convinced that these experiments were
essential. It is true that mutations do occur in nature, as does reshufﬂing of the
inﬂuenza genomic segments, but those performed in the laboratory were directed
mutations, whereas in nature such events are random, and may not be selected in
nature. The publication of these papers led to a storm of condemnations resulting
in a moratorium on such research until security matters could be discussed and
deﬁned. The NIH issued guidelines under what was termed ‘‘dual use research of
concern,’’ now known as ‘‘DURC.’’
DURC was deﬁned as ‘‘life sciences research that, based on current under-
standing, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information,
products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a signiﬁcant
threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety, agricultural
crops and other plants, animals, the environment, materiel, or national security’’
(DURC policy, here referred to as ‘‘dual use’’ policy). It includes six categories of
potentially problematic scientiﬁc experiments:
1. Enhancing the harmful consequences of an agent or toxin
2. Disrupting immunity or the effectiveness of an immunization against an agent
or toxin without clinical or agricultural justiﬁcation
3. Conferring to an agent or toxin resistance to clinically or agriculturally useful
prophylactic or therapeutic interventions against the agent or toxin, or facili-
tating its ability to evade detection methodologies
4. Increasing the stability or transmissibility of or the ability to disseminate an
agent or toxin
5. Altering the host range or tropism of an agent or toxin
6. Enhancing the susceptibility of a host population to an agent or toxin
Moreover, the government has declared a list of pathogens that fall into this
category:
‘‘… review will focus on research that involves one or more of the agents or
toxins listed below, which pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with most
signiﬁcant potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy,
critical infrastructure, or public conﬁdence, and produces, aims to produce, or is
reasonably anticipated to produce one or more of the effects listed above [my
wording] Viruses are listed in bold.’’

Scientists working on inﬂuenza imposed a moratorium on research leading to
alterations in the host range of avian inﬂuenza. This moratorium continued for one
year, but research has been renewed, taking into account the new regulations
imposed by the U.S. government on such research. Thus we are entering a ‘‘new
world’’ in virology, in which old viruses can be restored to life, or new ones
created. It brings to mind the ﬁlm ‘‘Jurassic Park,’’ where the DNA from dinosaur
eggs is cloned and ‘‘old’’ species are brought back to life. only to attack mankind.
We may be facing a similar situation.

Viruses as Biological Weapons
Abstract
Viruses as weapons of mass destruction have been in the forefront of the news
following the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conﬂict. Historically,
smallpox may have been used in the past as a weapon, both by throwing corpses
into the battleﬁeld, or supplying American Indians with contaminated blankets.
During World War II, the Japanese established a special unit, 731, to test
bacterial agents as weapons in China, using humans as experimental animals. In
1972 and entered into force in 1975, 158 countries, including the U.S. and the
Soviet Union, signed an agreement known as the ‘‘Biological and Toxins
Weapons Convention,’’ in which countries agreed to stop the development of
offensive biological and chemical weapons. Unfortunately, there was no clause
in the treaty for veriﬁcation. In 1998, Ken Alibek, a defector from the Soviet
Union, published a book, Biohazard, that unmasked wide segments of the
Soviet and then Russian biological war program [1], which included the growth
of smallpox and other viruses as offensive agents. Although the U.S. had a
biological warfare program, following the treaty, it shut down facilities for the
production of such weapons. Today, despite the treaty, it is known that many
countries are still working on and stockpiling biological weapons.

Introduction
During the last few years, the Department of Homeland Security has warned of the
possibilities and dangers of biological (germ) terrorist attacks. These warnings
increased after the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon, and during the war in Iraq. It was assumed that the government of
Sadam Hussein had stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, coined as
‘‘weapons of mass destruction.’’ Most of these were destroyed following UN
inspection, and new ones were not discovered after the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Syria

also has stockpiles of chemical weapons that were used in the current civil war in
that country in 2013; hopefully, these are currently being destroyed (2014). There
are fears that terrorists can manufacture biological weapons from bacteria or
viruses and use them in crowded cities, where the rate of spread and infection
would be extremely high (see table below for aerosol distribution).
The most prominent weapon considered has been anthrax, not a virus but a
deadly bacterium, engineered to be extremely pathogenic both to man and live-
stock. Unfortunately, deadly human viruses have also been adapted for use as
weapons, although the use of bacteria or virus to destroy one’s enemy is not new
(see history below). There are a few documented cases where infectious diseases
may have been deliberately introduced into a population. In the early days of the
Cold War, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union clandestinely supported the pro-
duction of bacteria and viruses for offensive purposes, although the U.S. appar-
ently stopped this production in the early 1970s, whereas the Soviet Union
continued with this development. Other countries, including Syria, Iran, China,
and North Korea may have developed biological weapons.
22.2
History of Biological Warfare
Since the beginning of recorded history there have been many attempts to destroy
the enemy by using infected bodies or natural toxins. There were deliberate efforts
to poison wells and food supplies. The Assyrians, Spartans, Carthaginians and
Persians were all reported to have used poisons or diseased bodies in their battles,
although the evidence is unsubstantiated. It is rather difﬁcult to prove, since there
is no archaeological evidence, and one depends on historians of the time who
might have their own biases. There is a report of poisonous snakes in ceramic
vessels being thrown into ships during a battle between the Carthaginians under
Hannibal and the Kingdom of Pergamon under King Eumenes II in 184 B.C. The
sailors of Eumenes ﬂed after realizing that this was not a joke.
During the Middle Ages and the period of the Black Death in Europe, decaying
bodies were catapulted into enemy strongholds with the hope of spreading disease.
The Tartars used this approach in the siege of the city of Caffa (modern-day
Feodosia) in the Crimea. This event is described in detail by the fourteenth-century
Genoese chronicler Gabriele de Mussi. In fact, he suggested that this was the
origin of the Black Death that swept Europe in the Middle Ages. He wrote,
‘‘Oh God! See how the heathen Tartar races, pouring together from all sides, suddenly
invested the city of Caffa and besieged the trapped Christians there for almost three years.
There, hemmed in by an immense army, they could hardly draw breath, although food
could be shipped in, which offered them some hope. But behold, the whole army was
affected by a disease which overran the Tartars and killed thousands upon thousands every
day. It was as though arrows were raining down from heaven to strike and crush the
Tartars’ arrogance (Table 22.1). All medical advice and attention was useless; the Tartars
died as soon as the signs of disease appeared on their bodies: swellings in the armpit or
groin caused by coagulating humours, followed by a putrid fever.
414
22
Viruses as Biological Weapons

The dying Tartars, stunned and stupeﬁed by the immensity of the disaster brought about by
the disease, and realizing that they had no hope of escape, lost interest in the siege. But
they ordered corpses to be placed in catapults and lobbed into the city in the hope that the
intolerable stench would kill everyone inside. What seemed like mountains of dead were
thrown into the city, and the Christians could not hide or ﬂee or escape from them,
although they dumped as many of the bodies as they could in the sea. And soon the rotting
corpses tainted the air and poisoned the water supply, and the stench was so overwhelming
that hardly one in several thousand was in a position to ﬂee the remains of the Tartar army.
Moreover one infected man could carry the poison to others, and infect people and places
with the disease by look alone. No one knew, or could discover, a means of defense.
Thus almost everyone who had been in the East, or in the regions to the south and north, fell
victim to sudden death after contracting this pestilential disease, as if struck by a lethal arrow
which raised a tumor on their bodies. The scale of the mortality and the form which it took
persuaded those who lived, weeping and lamenting, through the bitter events of
1346–1348—the Chinese, Indians, Persians, Medes, Kurds, Armenians, Cilicians, Geor-
gians, Mesopotamians, Nubians, Ethiopians, Turks, Egyptians, Arabs, Saracens and Greeks
(for almost all the East has been affected)—that the last judgement had come’’ [2, 3].
This may have been the ﬁrst authenticated example of biological warfare.
The exception, of course, to bacterial agents was the smallpox virus. Lord Jeffrey
Amherst was the commanding general of British forces in North America during the
ﬁnal battles of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), winning victories against the
French to acquireCanada for England.Pontiac,anOttawachief whohadsidedwiththe
French,ledanuprisingagainst the Britishafter the French surrender inCanada. Indians
were angered by Amherst‘s refusal to continue the French practice of providing sup-
plies in exchange for Indian friendship and assistance and by an imperious British
attitude toward them and their land. Colonel Henry Bouquet, an aide to General
Amherst,suggestedinthepostscriptofalettertoGeneralAmherstonJuly13,1763,the
distribution of blankets to ‘‘inoculate the Indians’’ with smallpox; Amherst, on July 16,
1763, approved this proposal, stating ‘‘to try every other method that can serve to
Extirpate thisExecrableRace.’’(Letterscontainingthisinformationcanbefoundatthe
United States Library of Congress, and the archives are on microﬁlm.) These letters
between Amherst and Bouquet and others indicate an intense hatred for the Indians by
Amherst,and the suggestions manytimes oferadicating the Indians byusingsmallpox.
This did not extend to tactics against the French, whom he admired (http://www.
nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/34_40_305_fn.jpeg).
Following is a copy of the correspondence between Colonel Bouquet and
General Amherst:
P.S. I will try to inocculate the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands,
taking care however not to get the disease myself. As it is pity to oppose good men against
them, I wish we could make use of the Spaniard’s Method, and hunt them with English
Dogs. Supported by Rangers, and some Light Horse, who would I think effectively
extirpate or remove that Vermine.
On July 16 Amherst replied, also in a postscript:
P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blanketts, as well as to
try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race. I should be very
glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect, but England is at too
great a Distance to think of that at present.

I received yesterday your Excellency’s letters of 16th with their Inclosures. The signal for
Indian Messengers, and all your directions will be observed.
There was an outbreak of smallpox at Fort Pitts and we assume that the orders
were carried out, since an epidemic of smallpox did occur among the Indian tribes
the following spring (or months). However, we have no idea whether in fact these
two events are connected.
22.3
Twentieth-Century Horrors
During the twentieth century the Japanese used various infectious species of bacteria
(cholera, anthrax, pestis) in the war against China [4]. A unique unit (‘‘Unit 731’’)
developed new weapons for germ warfare, and performed humanexperimentation on
a large scale. According to the 2002 International Symposium on the Crimes of
Bacteriological Warfare, the number of people killed in germ warfare and human
experiment programs by the Japanese Army was around 580,000. According to other
sources, the use of biological weapons researched in Unit 731’s bio-weapons and
chemical weapons programs resulted in possibly as many as 200,000 deaths of
military personnel and civilians in China. The cruelty involved in these experiments
in indescribable and ranks among the worst atrocities in their extent and methods
outside of the Holocaust. (For more details, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_
731. The cruelty described in this article is hard to believe.)
Biological weapons are easy and cheap to produce. The U,S. and other major
nations have developed their own weapons of mass destruction, particularly atomic
weapons. However, these have a distinct disadvantage in that in order to deliver
them, one needs sophisticated bombs or missiles. Biological weapons can be as
simple as an infected person (‘‘suicide bomber’’), or a vial containing infectious
material. It is even possible to have small bombs that on explosion will deliver
anthrax or smallpox or other viruses into the air which can either be inhaled,
picked up on clothing, or by bodily contact. Chemical weapons such as poisonous
gas, may have the same instant effect, but do not spread beyond the area in which
they are used. Smallpox or inﬂuenza in the trenches is much more effective in the
long run than mustard gas. However, there is the danger in a war situation that it
might get back to the troops using this to start out with. This may have happened
with the use of the tularemia bacteria by the Russians during World War II at
Stalingrad [1]. However, some doubt has been cast on this by the U.S. Ofﬁce of
Chemical and Biological Weapons (CBW).
The ease of travel around the globe makes it easy to transport biological
weapons. They are small and easy to hide in luggage or even on the body (infected
individuals). The urbanization of the world with cities of millions of teeming
inhabitants are ideal targets for the terrorist or even the nation wanting to inﬂict
maximum casualties. Viruses can be grown in small laboratories by anyone with
416
22
Viruses as Biological Weapons

limited knowledge of cell culture, and it may be possible to purchase virus stocks
through a third party, ostensibly for research purposes. This apparently was the
approach taken by the Soviet Union in the 1970s–1980s. Until very recently it was
possible to purchase infective agents for research from the American Type Culture
Collection; they could be purchased by commercial laboratories and then trans-
ferred to the military for development. Today, after the attack on the World Trade
Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001, this is more difﬁcult. However, a
country or group wishing to develop viral weapons can establish a molecular
biology laboratory and copy genetic information to produce viruses such as
poliovirus or other small viruses in vitro (see discussion on creating viruses in the
test tube Chap. 21). Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, large numbers of
scientists working on the Russian germ war establishment found themselves
unemployed. These scientists were targeted by countries such as Iraq and Iran,
countries with the ﬁnancial ability to hire such scientists to continue the work they
were doing in the Soviet Union. This is similar to events after World War II, when
German scientists were hired by the U.K. and the U.S. to continue some research
into nuclear weapons and rocket technology, or, in the case of the Japanese,
scientists involved in biological warfare who were not prosecuted after World
War II. In fact, the Russians used Japanese blueprints from Unit 731 to establish
their clandestine program, even down to using the building plans for the estab-
lishment of new centers. One thing that terrorists or rogue states have going for
them is an increased public awareness of events through the Internet and other
media. This in turn could induce mass panic and enhance the effects of such
weapons—for example, by crowding through panic, or alternatively by ﬂeeing and
thus transmitting the disease further aﬁeld.
In 1972, today 160 countries—including the U.S. and the Soviet Union—signed
an agreement known as the ‘‘Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention’’ in
which they agreed to stop the development of offensive biological and chemical
weapons. This treaty was supposed to go into effect in 1975, but, there were no
details on the means of verifying that countries lived up to the agreement. This was
missing from the pact and led to several nations clandestinely developing such
weapons [5].
Historically, the Geneva Convention of 1925, following World War I, in which
the Germans used poisonous gas, banned the use of such weapons. It banned the
use of such chemical weapons and also expanded it to biological weapons. During
World War II, the U.S. initiated a program to develop biological weapons, which
led to the production of anthrax bombs; this was to be used in retaliation for
Japanese or Germans’ use of such weapons. They were never used, and instead the
war against the Japanese ended with the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan,
which was more destructive or just as destructive as the biological weapons. The
U.S. in fact continued its program on biological weapons development at Fort
Dietrich until 1969 when President Nixon ordered the cessation of this program
and the destruction of existing stockpiles.

22.4
Weapons Development in the Soviet Union
Despite being a signatory to the pact, the Soviet Union continued with its program
of developing biological weapons on a massive scale. Defectors from the Soviet
Union have provided information on a program that employed as many as 50,000
workers in the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of Yersinia pestis,
development of tons of smallpox virus, and two senior Russian microbiologists,
Dr. Vladimir Pasechnik and Dr. Ken Alibek (Alibekov), defected to the U.K. and
U.S. and gave information on the Soviet program. The former served as director of
the Institute of Ultra Pure Biochemical Preparations in Leningrad, and the latter
was First Deputy Chief of the Biopreparat System, a large network of biological
weapons-oriented facilities (Pasechnik’s institute being among them). Moreover,
in 1998, Alibek published Biohazard, a book that exposed wide segments of the
Soviet and then-Russian biological war program [1]. Orders were given by the
President of Russia, Leonid Brezhnev, to develop various systems for military use.
Factories for the mass production of anthrax, Yersinia, and smallpox in large
amounts (enough to wipe out humanity many times over) were set up in many
locations, and the organisms placed into warheads of ballistic missiles for use
against the U.S. Alibek describes in frightening detail the construction and running
of such facilities, as well as the hazards of working in them. This work was
undertaken because of fear that the U.S. would eventually try to destroy the Soviet
Union, and the program continued and expanded even in the time of Gorbachev
and perestroika.
After a hiatus of many years because of the inﬂuence on genetics by Troﬁm
Lysenko, who believed environmental factors to be more important than genetic
ones, in the 1970s Russian scientists turned their attention to molecular biology as
it was being developed in the West. This meant that such scientists learned how to
construct recombinant molecules and to splice and reattach different genes. These
techniques were used in developing new strains of organisms, much more virulent
than the original ‘‘wild-type’’ strain, and in many cases resistant to antibiotics (in
the case of bacteria), and virus strains resistant to commonly used vaccines. At it
height, Biopreparat, as this division of the military wing of the Soviet Union was
called,
employed
over
30,000
people,
plus
about
15,000 scientists,
and
10,000 more in the development of agricultural toxins that could wipe out plants
or livestock. The whole massive program was carried out under complete secrecy
and was unknown to anyone outside the Russian military and Communist lead-
ership. Many of these facilities have been dismantled but it is believed that some
are still functioning in secret.
Although smallpox was ofﬁcially eliminated as a plague on earth, and only two
vials were retained for research purposes, the Soviet Union took advantage of this
situation and developed even more pathogenic strains, collecting them from an
outbreak in India. Although the initiative to eliminate smallpox worldwide came in
1958 from Viktor Zdhanov, a Russian virologist, he headed the biological warfare
program for many years, beginning in 1973. Was his intention to eliminate the
418
22
Viruses as Biological Weapons

disease, but at the same time develop smallpox as a weapon that could then be
used on a non-immune population? The Soviet scientists learned how to produce
these organisms on an industrial scale. Although they introduced stringent con-
ditions of sterility and safety, occasional accidents did happen, and organisms
escaped into the environment. One case was the escape of anthrax spores in
Sverdlovsk, resulting in the deaths of a great number of people (the exact number
is not known), since this was kept secret by the KGB, who blamed the outbreak on
contaminated meat sold on the black market. In the late 1980s, Biopreparat began
work on even more deadly viruses, such as Marburg and Ebola. When a scientist
contracted Marburg by accident and died, the virus that was removed from his
body at the autopsy was shown to be an even more pathogenic strain and was put
into production. Enough virus was produced to kill everyone on earth. These
viruses were put into small bombs that could easily be dropped on populated areas
or sprayed from planes. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, American
virologists were allowed to visit the ‘‘secret’’ factories, and even participated in
dismantling some of the huge facilities for growing tons of dangerous organisms.
However, there is still suspicion that the Russian military has not disclosed the
location of all its factories and may still be working on these abhorrent strains of
bacteria and virus, perhaps even with funds obtained from the U.S.
Alibek’s book makes it clear that most Russian scientists working in this area
believed that the U.S. was pursuing biological weapons with the aim of destroying
the Soviet Union. It was only after visiting the U.S., and seeing for themselves that
such facilities did not exist, or if they did, were not in use, that it became clear that
the U.S. did not have a program similar to the one in the Soviet Union. Soviet
scientists were brainwashed by their government, and also received the kinds of
perks for working in this area of virology that they could never have received
working for civilian outﬁts. The arsenal of weapons developed by the Soviet
Union, and possibly other countries include bacteria such as anthrax, tularemia,
glanders (a bacterial disease of horses, but also lethal to humans) and typhus; and
viral diseases such as smallpox, Venezuela equine encephalitis, dengue fever,
Lassa fever, Marburg, Ebola, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever and other hemorrhage-
causing agents.
There is no evidence that the U.S. continued it biological warfare program after
President Nixon ordered its cessation; they did have such a program during World
War II and for a short time afterwards, but compared to the Soviet program, it was
a small one and was mostly devoted to the development of anthrax and tularemia
as weapons. The American program was similar to the Soviet program but dis-
banded by President Nixon. The parallels between these programs suggest that
Soviet spies transferred information to the Soviet military. It is known that many
other countries are involved in developing biological weapons; these include Iran,
China, India, and possibly North Korea. Material is readily available, and it is very
cheap to develop such weapons. The knowledge of how to reconstruct antibiotic-
resistant bacteria or more pathogenic viruses can be found in most molecular
biology journals, textbooks or on the Internet.
22.4
Weapons Development in the Soviet Union
419

To summarize: In order to produce biological weapons, one needs to develop
pathogenic strains of an organism that can overcome natural and induced immu-
nity, This was done with anthrax and smallpox. For weapons-grade material, one
has to develop the means to grow large quantities in large vats under ideal con-
ditions (the Russians have produced large amounts of material). The material has
to be dried and maintained in an active state, which is difﬁcult with most viruses,
or, in the case of anthrax, maintained as spores so that it can be spread as a ﬁne
aerosol (1–10 microns). Of course these agents have to be handled with extreme
care, and under circumstances where escape is impossible. This requires facilities
with many layers of walls and doors, as well as separate air-handling systems.
These conditions are shown in cartoon form in Fig. 22.1.
The American government and military, until the late 1990s and turn of this
century, did not believe that biological weapons were a danger or that they would
work in the battleﬁeld, which may be one of the reasons for the U.S. abandoning
its program in the 1970s. It was thought that atomic weapons were a much better
defense against attack. However, with the rise of terrorism, this attitude has
changed, and it is realized that even unsophisticated terrorists can manufacture and
set off biological weapons easily in crowded malls or subway systems. One of the
major problems facing any potential target is the insidiousness of the attack, since
initially few people may fall ill, and it may not be recognized as the result of a
deliberate attack. For example, most physicians in the West have never seen a case
of smallpox, so initially it may be misdiagnosed and transmitted to thousands of
others before it is realized that it is the result of an attack. A similar scenario is true
of most of the other agents. It thus behooves all countries facing this danger to
stockpile vaccines and supplies of antibiotics in case of such an event. However,

even then, it may take time to realize that this is a biological attack, and in many
instances vaccines and antibiotics will arrive too late to suppress the agent in the
initial population. Table 22.1 estimates the number of deaths and number inca-
pacitated if there were an attack in an urban setting. The only way to stop such an
attack is vigilance and tight control over countries and inspection of their facilities,
as was carried out in the case of Iraq in the 1990s.
