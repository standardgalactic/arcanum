Husserl’s Mereological Semiotics: Indications, 
Expressions, Surrogates 
§1. Introduction 
In their “Evolution of the Genus Homo,” anthropologists Ian Tattersall and Jeffrey H. 
Schwartz write that it is “symbolic consciousness that makes our species,” Homo sapiens, 
“unique.”1 The closest they come to defining “symbolic consciousness,” however, is the 
following. 
Human beings alone, it seems, mentally dissect the world into a multitude of discrete 
symbols, and combine and recombine those symbols in their minds to produce 
hypotheses of alternative possibilities. (“Evolution,” 83) 
They “suggest” (84), furthermore, that it was “the invention of language, the ultimate symbol-
dependent activity” (85) that led Homo sapiens to fully actualize its “symbolic capacity” (83). 
Though Tattersall and Schwartz do not tell us what symbols are, this appeal to language is 
enough to point the way. Symbols, at the very least, must be signs, or things that function like 
signs.  
But what precisely are signs? For assistance on this point, we might begin with Jacques 
Derrida’s attempt to “describ[e] . . . the structure of signs as classically determined.” Signs, he 
says, are things that we use in place of other things. They stand in for something that we cannot 
access. To be a sign for something is to be its replacement or substitute.2

Phenomena itself will be cited henceforth as SP. For the French original of SP (though not the “other essays”), see 
Jacques Derrida, La Voix et le Phénomène (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 2009).

Whether or not this is the traditional understanding of signs, it is the one Derrida claims 
to find in the work of Edmund Husserl. “Every sign is a sign for something,” writes Husserl,3 
and this means—Derrida says—that being a sign means “‘being-for’ . . . in the sense of ‘being-
in-the-place-of’.” Indeed, “reference” is a matter of “substitution” (SP, 23). To be a sign, for 
Husserl, is to be a stand-in for something else.  
But is this, in fact, Husserl’s understanding of signs? Perhaps philosophers cannot settle 
the issue of whether “symbolic consciousness” is unique to humans, but we can help to clarify 
the phenomenology of signs. Let us, then, like Derrida, turn to the first of the Logical 
Investigations, where Husserl describes three types of signs. It will be my contention, contra 
Derrida, that we do not experience the relation between indicative signs and what they indicate, 
nor that between expressive signs and their referents, as relations of substitution. Rather, we 
experience these as mereological relationships. Only with surrogative signs do we have an 
experience that might match Derrida’s description of signs.4

4 I frequently employ the construction, “we experience x as y,” in what follows. To “experience x as y” is to 
intend x as y (whether that intention is fulfilled or empty), without this seeming to be an active interpretation on our 
part (that is, without it seeming to be something we have consciously chosen). Synonyms include, “x shows up for 
us as y,” “x appears to us as y,” and “x seems to us to be y.” Further, “we experience x as y” is meant to be a 
phenomenological claim, not an ontological claim about the nature of x.

§2. Indicative Signs  
In §1 of Investigation I, Husserl draws a distinction between indications (Anzeigen) and 
expressions (Ausdrücke). He does not begin his investigation of indications, however, until §2.  
a. Investigation I, §2 
After providing a list of things that function as indications, Husserl tells us that things 
only are indications when they are experienced in a certain manner. This experience, Husserl 
says, involves two beliefs. The first is a belief that the indication itself—whether it be an 
“object” or a “state of affairs”—exists. The second is a belief that some other “object or state of 
affairs” also exists. Furthermore, Husserl says, when something is actually “functioning” as an 
indication, this is because the first belief “motivates” the second. That is, we believe that some 
other thing is actual because we believe that the indicating thing is actual (Hua XIX, 31–
32/1:184). 
The experience of something as an indication for something else does not involve two 
separate beliefs, however; rather, we have a single belief about the whole indicative situation.  
[T]he ‘motivational’ unity of our acts of judgment has itself the character of a unity of 
judgment; and, therefore, in the judgment’s being a whole, an appearing objective 
correlate, a unitary state of affairs—which seems to be in it—is meant. (Hua XIX, 
32/1:184)5 
We should not take the terminological shift here, from “belief” to “judgment,” too strictly, given 
what Husserl says later. Our experience of an indication’s indicating something need not be 
                                                           
5 I have altered Findlay’s translation: “[T]he ‘motivational’ unity of our acts of judgment has itself the 
character of a unity of judgment; before it as a whole an objective correlate, a unitary state of affairs, parades itself, 
is meant in such a judgment, appears to be in and for that judgment.” The German reads: “[D]ie Motivierungseinheit 
der Urteilsakte hat selbst den Charakter einer Urteilseinheit und somit in ihrer Gesamtheit ein erscheinendes 
gegenständliches Korrelat, einen einheitlichen Sachverhalt, der in ihr zu sein scheint, in ihr vermeint ist.”

“conceptual.” It is, or at least can be, much closer to simple perception, as if we “see” the 
indicated thing through the indication (Hua XIX 40–41/1:189–90; cf. 32–35/1:184–86). The 
point of the above quotation, then, is that in encountering an indication, we are actually 
encountering a single “state of affairs,” consisting of two parts: the indication’s “being given,” 
and the indicated object’s existing (though not its being given). These two parts, like the two 
parts of the complex “judgment,” are not separate. Rather, they have an “objective connection” 
in the former’s entailing (to speak loosely)6 the later (Hua XIX, 32/1:184).7 
b. Investigation I, §4 
In §4, “Digression on the origin of indication in association,” Husserl claims: (a) to 
experience one thing as indicating another, one must experience the two as associated, and (b) to 
experience two things as associated is to experience them as unified, independently of any (lack 
of) objective unity created by their “essences” (Hua XIX, 35–36/1:186–87). Husserl’s argument, 
however, is not that two associated things are unified only because we take them together; rather, 
they are unified because association “operates creatively, and produces peculiar descriptive 
characters and forms of unity” (Hua XIX, 36/1:186–87). We experience the unity of two 
associated things as something that “forc[es] itself upon us,” rather than as something we 
introduce. When we experience two things as associated, thinking of one calls the other to 
                                                           
6 As Investigation I, §3 tells us, the way in which an indication points to (“hinweisen”) its indicated-object 
is not the same as the way in which premises point to (“beweisen”) conclusions. 
7 Alphonso Lingis writes: “A sign, really visible, audible, palpable, can refer to some real object, some 
event or entity present or absent in the world.” Alphonso Lingis, “The Signs of Consciousness,” SubStance 13, no. 
42 (1984): 3–14, here 4. However, given the contrast here between what is given and what is not given, it would be 
more accurate to say: “The absence of what is indicated is necessary to indication; smoke is not a sign of fire when 
we see both the smoke and the fire. Indication is the paradigmatic case of something absent being intended by 
consciousness.” Robert Sokolowski, Husserlian Meditations: How Words Present Things (Evanston, IL: 
Northwestern University Press, 1974), 112. Henceforth cited as HM.

mind—one “points to the other”—because they form an “intentional unity,” in which they “seem 
to belong” together, or to be “pertinent” to each other (Hua XIX, 36/1:187). 
Husserl then takes up our experience of physical objects as an example in which we 
experience association. It is because we experience the parts of a physical object as associated 
with each other, and hence as “pointing to [one] another,” that we experience the thing (the 
whole) itself. The whole, as it were, hangs together in our experience because of the fact that we 
experience the various parts of the whole as “referring” to each other (Hua XIX, 36–37/1:187).8 
Husserl then applies this to what we already know about indications. In both the case of 
empirical wholes, and in the case of indication, association between two (or more) things leads 
us to experience the two as unified into a whole, such that one points to the other. In other words, 
whenever we experience one object as indicating another, we experience the two as associated, 
and thus as forming a unified whole with each other, and thus as pointing to each other (Hua 
XIX, 37/1:187). 
§3. Results regarding Indications 
a. Wholes versus Aggregates 
Any object that—because of the type of object it is—cannot exist unless some other 
object of a specific type exists, is “founded” upon some object of that type (Hua XIX, 281–
82/2:34). In Investigation III, Husserl uses this idea of “foundation” to define parts and wholes. 
                                                           
8 What Husserl says here, however, does not mean that we experience the parts, and then must synthesize 
them into a whole. It is, rather, that our experiences of empirical wholes do not splinter into separate experiences of 
individual parts (which “can be made to stand out as units” [Hua XIX, 36/1:187]) because we experience those parts 
as pointing to other parts within the whole, even when we allow them to stand out for themselves. Cf. Edmund 
Husserl, Philosophie der Arithmetik mit ergänzenden Texten (1890–1901), ed. Lothar Eley, Husserliana XII (The 
Hague: Nijhoff, 1970), 195; English translation: Philosophy of Arithmetic: Psychological and Logical Investigations 
with Supplementary Texts from 1887–1901, trans. Dallas Willard, Edmund Husserl Collected Works, vol. 10 
(Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2003), 207. Henceforth cited as Hua XII with German and English page references, 
respectively.

“By a Whole we understand a range of contents which are all covered by a single foundation 
without the help of further contents. The contents of such a range we call its parts” (Hua XIX, 
282/2:34).9 The color, extension, and shape of one face of a die form a whole, for example, 
because each is founded on the other two. You cannot have a color that is unextended, nor an 
extension that is not shaped, nor a shape that is not colored. The four dots that form the square on 
that face of the die, however, only do so because they together found a “figural moment” of 
squareness; this is what makes them a whole (Hua XIX, 237/2:8, 284/2:35–36, 288/2:38, 
293/2:40; see also, Hua XII, 201–5/213–17). Each could exist without the other three, but their 
configuration could not exist if any of them were not to exist. If two parts of a whole are 
independent of each other, therefore, they are only members of the same whole because they 
together found some third part (or because there is some third part that together with them helps 
to found a fourth part, etc.) (Hua XIX, 286/2:36–37). 
While the connections between the parts of a whole have to do with the essences of the 
parts (even if, e.g., it is just that each part is “visible,” and thus together they enter into a visible 
configuration), the members of an aggregate can be of completely unrelated species. They unite 
within the aggregate simply because someone mentally intends them together (Hua XIX, 288–
89/2:38). Here, we are dealing with Husserl’s understanding of groups, developed in Philosophy 
of Arithmetic: for two or more things to belong to an aggregate or group, some person must 
intend each individually, while intending all of them together in one mental act (Hua XII, 69–
74/72–77). Insofar as this is all there is to a group, groups are not wholes. Only if all parts are 
connected by relations of foundation do we have an actual whole (Hua XIX, 289–90/2:38). 
                                                           
9 By “content,” here, Husserl means the same as “object” (Hua XIX, 231/2:5). 

7 
 
Now, our question is, “Were we right to maintain that the unity we experience between 
an indication and what it indicates is that of a whole, not that of a group?” One might think that 
the unity is that of a group, because Husserl insists that when we experience two things as 
associated, we experience them as unified even if the species to which they belong are not 
intrinsically related. However, association “operates creatively, and produces peculiar descriptive 
characters and forms of unity” (Hua XIX, 36/1:186–87), such that we experience associated 
things as “belonging” together, and “pertinent” to each other. Their unity is something that 
“forc[es] itself upon us” (Hua XIX, 36/1:187), not something we introduce by simply intending 
them together. Thus, Husserl’s description of the unity created by association does not fit his 
description of aggregates or groups. Furthermore, since the only other type of unity Husserl 
describes is the unity of wholes, we must conclude, on Husserl’s account, that we experience 
indications and what they indicate—since we experience them as associated—as being united in 
the manner of a whole. This conclusion is supported by Husserl’s appeal to our experience of the 
parts of physical wholes as being a paradigm case of the experience of association (Hua XIX, 
36–37/1:187).  
b. Indications and Their Referents Experienced as 
Parts within a Whole 
Husserl says, “Objects can stand to others in the relation of wholes and parts, or also in 
the relation of coordinated parts of a whole” (Hua XIX, 229/2:4).10 Therefore, given that we 
experience an indication as forming a whole with its indicated-object, we have two possible 
                                                           
10 I have modified Findlay’s translation to eliminate a comma splice, make capitalization consistent, and 
hew more closely to the German: “Gegenstände können zueinander in dem Verhältnis von Ganzen und Teilen oder 
auch in dem Verhältnis von koordinierten Teilen eines Ganzen stehen.” Findlay has: “Objects can be related to one 
another as Wholes to Parts, they can also be related to one another as coordinated parts of a whole.”

explanations of this experience. Either (a) we experience one as the whole to which the other 
belongs, or (b) we experience the two as parts, united within some larger whole.  
We must, I believe, reject option (a). A “knot in a handkerchief” is an indication of 
something to remember, but we do not experience it as itself a part of the thing to be 
remembered, nor do we experience the thing to be remembered as part of the knot. “Martian 
canals” are a sign of “intelligent beings” (Hua XIX, 31/1:184), but we do not experience them as 
part of those intelligent beings, nor do we experience the intelligent beings as part of the canals. 
The rooster’s crowing is an indication of sunrise, but we do not experience it as itself part of 
sun’s rising, nor do we experience the sun’s rising as part of the rooster’s crowing. Smoke is an 
indication of fire, but we experience it precisely as smoke: a product, but not a part, of fire.  
Therefore, we must experience an indication and its indicated-object as being two parts 
within some larger whole. But how exactly are we to describe this union? Do we experience (a) 
the indication as founding the indicated-object (or vice versa), (b) each as founding the other, or 
(c) them both, together, as founding some third part?  
If there is any “founding” going on in our experience of indication, it must have 
something to do with the “objective connection” we experience between an indication and what 
it indicates. Husserl writes that to encounter one thing as indicating another is to believe that 
“certain things”—namely, the object(s) indicated—“may or must exist, since other things”—
namely, the indicating object(s)—“have been given” (Hua XIX, 32/1:184). That is, “if the 
indicating thing(s) have been given, then the thing(s) indicated may or must exist.” In the cases 
where we experience the connection as a “must,” therefore, we experience the existence of the 
indicated object as a necessary condition for the givenness (and, hence, existence) of the 
indication; we experience the indicated object as founding the indication. But the motivation we 

9 
 
experience between our beliefs in some experiences of indication only rises to the level of “may” 
(not “must”). What consequences do such experiences have for Husserl’s claim that the 
connections between parts must be that of foundation (and, hence, necessity)?  
Here are the facts, as we have them: (1) Husserl’s description of our experience of 
indications in Investigation I is a description of an experience of a relation between parts within a 
larger whole, (2) Husserl admits that sometimes we experience the relation between indication 
and indicated object as falling short of necessity, and yet (3) Husserl claims in Investigation III 
that parts are united into wholes by relations of foundation, which involves parts being necessary 
conditions for other parts. That is, (4) there is an apparent conflict between Husserl’s description 
of our experience of indication in Investigation I, and Husserl’s description of parts in 
Investigation III. What are we to make of this? 
First, we must note that Husserl is engaged in phenomenology in Investigation I, 
describing the experience of indications, while he is engaged in ontology in Investigation III, 
describing the nature of parts and wholes. Thus, there may be no ultimate conflict between 
saying that (a) we experience indications as united with their referents as parts within a whole, 
even if we sometimes experience the connection between them as falling short of necessity, and 
(b) in themselves, parts are connected with other parts into wholes necessarily.  
Second, reality is often more complex or vague than any precise set of definitions, or any 
precisely formulated theory, can perfectly capture. Thus, we need not be surprised if Husserl’s 
attempt at formulating a theory of the nature of parts and wholes in Investigation III turns out to 
fall a bit short of completely capturing his phenomenology of our experience of indications in 
Investigation I. The phenomenology, if properly done, may get us closer to reality than the 
theory, even if the theory is generally adequate. 

10 
 
Third, in those cases where we experience the connection between the reality of the 
indication and the reality of its referent as falling short of necessity, this does not mean that we 
do not experience both as having a necessary connection to some third part. Take, for instance, 
our experience of the human body. The sight of a hand will motivate us to believe in the 
existence of an arm. However, we recognize that one can exist without the other. That is, if 
pressed, we will admit that the existence of an arm is not a necessary condition for the existence 
of a hand. The arm in question may have been completely destroyed, leaving only the hand 
behind. When the two are actually part of a whole, however, they do serve to found a third part: 
the figural moment, or overall arrangement, form, or shape of the whole to which they belong. 
Each is a necessary condition for that figural moment to exist. Thus, in those cases where we 
experience the connection between indication and indicated as being less than necessary, perhaps 
they help to found some third part of the whole to which we experience them as belonging. 
And fourth, it may be that the experience of motivation leads us to experience the 
indication as founding the referent. We are not, after all, theoretically reflecting on the situation 
when we encounter one thing as an indication for another. “In the moment,” our belief in the 
reality of the referent is founded on our belief in the reality of the indication; the belief in the 
reality of the referent would not exist were it not for the belief in the reality of the indication. 
And since the whole of which the indication and referent are parts is showing up for us through 
those believing intentions11 or experiences, we may experience the objects of those beliefs as 
similarly related by foundation.  
Again, it is not as if we were engaged in reflection upon our beliefs and the fact that one 
is founding the other, and then inferring that this reflects the relation between the objects of the 
                                                           
11 My thanks to an anonymous commenter for bringing this formulation to mind. 

11 
 
beliefs. Everything is more immediate than that. We are experiencing (or “intending”) the two 
objects in a believing manner, and the part of this believing experience that is directed upon the 
indication founds the part of this believing experience that is directed upon the referent. Thus, 
our experience is structured such that the indication we are experiencing may show up for us as 
founding its referent. I offer this as a possibility, without being able to say with confidence that it 
would actually match a proper phenomenology of the experience of indications. 
What we can say, in the end, is that Husserl has portrayed the experience of indication as 
an experience of the indication and its referent as being united as two parts within a larger whole, 
and that in at least some of these experiences we experience the referent as a necessary condition 
for (as “founding”) the indication. Investigation III’s theory of parts and wholes, therefore, is 
helpful in explicating Husserl’s phenomenology of indication, but we must leave open the 
question of whether that theory is fully adequate.  
c. Indicative Experience Grounded in Mereological 
Experience 
It would seem that we cannot experience one thing as an indication of another if we do 
not experience the two as parts within a whole. But can we experience two things as parts within 
a whole without experiencing one as indicating the other? Surely we can. A hand is not an 
indication of an arm unless the arm is absent (i.e., hidden by a wall, a sleeve, graveyard soil, 
etc.). If both the hand and arm are given, we would experience the two as associated, and as 
being two parts of a whole, and yet we would not experience either as indicating the other,12 
                                                           
12 See Sokolowski, HM, 112. Sokolowski even argues that to experience any two things as associated, we 
must experience one as absent, while the other is present. Robert Sokolowski, Presence and Absence: A 
Philosophical Investigation of Language and Being (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1978), 24. Henceforth 
cited as PA.

since our belief in each would be merely confirming our belief in the other, rather than giving 
rise to it through motivation. 
Thus, our experience of things as parts united within wholes is “wider” than our 
experience of things as indicating and indicated. But when we do experience one thing as 
indicating another, do we experience them as indicating and indicated because we experience 
them as parts within a whole, or do we experience them as parts within a whole because we 
experience them as indicating and indicated? Husserl says that indication has its “origin in 
association” (Hua XIX, 35/1:186), and, as we saw above, when we experience things as 
associated, we experience them as being mereologically unified. Thus, while we can experience 
two things as united as parts within a whole without experiencing either as an indication of the 
other, we cannot experience two things as indication and indicated if we do not first experience 
them as associatively united within a whole. Our experience of indications depends on our 
experience of parts and wholes. Semiotic experience is grounded in mereological experience (at 
least insofar as indications are concerned). 
d. Preliminary Results regarding the Nature of 
Signs 
Signs, we learned from Derrida, are substitutes or replacements. They are things that we 
use as present stand-ins for absent objects (“Differance,” 138). Though Derrida (SP, 23) claims 
to find this understanding of signs in Husserl, we have examined Husserl’s description of the 
experience of one type of sign, and found him to be describing an experience of the sign’s 
uniting with its referent as two parts within a larger whole. We do not find something to be 
absent, and then go looking for a replacement. Rather, we find something present, and discover 
that it motivates us to believe in something absent—something for which the present thing is not 

13 
 
experienced as a substitute but with which it is experienced as being unified as two parts within a 
whole.  
Derrida argues that Husserl, in the end, believes all signs are indications (SP, 42), but the 
understanding of signs that Derrida attributes to Husserl does not match Husserl’s understanding 
of how we experience indications. Whether it matches Husserl’s understanding of how we 
experience expressions—the other type of sign to which Husserl devotes extensive study in 
Investigation I—we shall now see.  
§4. Expressive Signs 
a. Investigation I, §§5–9 
What distinguishes expressions from indications is that they have a meaning (Hua XIX, 
59/1:201; cf. 30/1:183), and thus Husserl’s primary example of expressions are the signs used in 
“speech” (Hua XIX, 37/1:187). An expression obtains its meaning from “acts of mind” (Hua 
XIX, 39/1:189),13 “and in so far as it means something, it relates [bezieht] to what is objective.” 
This “relation [Beziehung] to an object is realized [realisiert],” however, only when the object 
meant by the expression is “actually present through accompanying intuitions”—intuitions that 
have the role of “confirming” or “illustrating” the expression “and so actualizing [aktualisieren] 
its relation to its object.” Without such an intuition of the referent, the “relation of expression to 
object is . . . unrealized [unrealisiert] as being confined to a mere meaning-intention.” Only 
when “the originally empty meaning-intention is . . . fulfilled” (i.e., when “the object is . . . 
intuitively before one”) does the expression’s “relation to [its] object [become] realized” (Hua 
XIX, 44/1:192).  
                                                           
13 Cf. Hua XIX, 38/1:188, where Husserl calls them “states,” rather than “acts,” and insists that they are 
not, in fact, the meaning of expressions. Cf. also Hua XIX, 44/1:192. 

14 
 
b. Investigation I, §10 
In §10, Husserl says that the experience of expression falls into two basic kinds of mental 
acts: (a) the mental act(s) of experiencing the expression itself (e.g., seeing it or hearing it), and 
(b) the act of meaning something through the expression, as well as, perhaps, actually intuiting 
the object that is meant (Hua XIX, 45/1:193). However, if we are to properly describe the 
experience of an expression, we must note that some of its parts are more “weight[y],” obtrusive, 
or important than others. Specifically, when we experience an expression, we are primarily 
engaged not with the sign itself, but with enacting some meaning. Our mission (as it were) is not 
to examine the sign, but to mean the sign’s meaning (Hua XIX, 45–46/1:193).14 
Husserl’s claim is that our emphasis on the act of meaning, rather than on the act of 
presenting the sign, is due to “the asymmetry [Ungleichseitigkeit] of the relation between an 
expression and the object which (through its meaning) it expresses or names” (Hua XIX, 45–
46/1:193). In §9, Husserl only spoke of the relation between expression and referent insofar as it 
was given to an expression by its meaning-intention, and actualized by its meaning-fulfillment 
(Hua XIX, 44/1:192). In §10, we now learn the relationship between an expression and its 
referent is asymmetrical. 
This does not mean, however, that the signs themselves are unimportant in our 
experience of expression. In fact, a hearer or reader is spurred to mean some referent by the 
words she hears or reads.15 She is invited to join the speaker or writer in giving sense to the 
                                                           
14 Thus, we can understand why Levinas claims that expressions are like windows, for Husserl. We do not 
look at them, but instead look through them to some object beyond them. Emmanuel Levinas, “The Work of 
Edmund Husserl,” in Discovering Existence with Husserl, trans. and ed. Richard Cohen and Michael Smith 
(Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1998),  47–87, here 59. Henceforth cited as “Work of Edmund 
Husserl.” 
15 What Husserl says here cannot be a description of the experience of an expression from the speaker’s or 
writer’s point of view. Husserl claims that when we hear or see an expression, this leads us to engage in a meaning-
intention directed at some object, and to focus on that object. If this were a description of the speaker’s or writer’s 

15 
 
words, to participate in expressing the object to which the words point (Hua XIX, 46/1:193).16 
Furthermore, Husserl argues: 
Such pointing [Hinzeigen] is not to be described as the mere objective fact of a regular 
diversion of interest from one thing to another. The fact that two presented objects A and 
B are so linked by some secret psychological coordination that the presentation of A 
regularly arouses the presentation of B, and that interest is thereby shifted from A to B—
such a fact does not make A the expression of the presentation of B. To be an expression 
is rather a descriptive aspect of the experienced unity of sign and thing signified [der 
Erlebniseinheit zwischen Zeichen und Bezeichnetem]. (Hua XIX, 46/1:193)17 
Here, Husserl echoes his exploration of indication and association in Investigation I, §4. In our 
experience of both indications and expressions, we have something other than the fact that 
experiencing the sign brings the thing signified to mind. With indications, Husserl appealed to 
our experience of part-to-part relationships, and said that indications “point to” what they 
indicate and “provide evidence for” them (Hua XIX, 36–37/1:187). With expressions, Husserl 
does not appeal to part-to-part relationships, but does say that expressions point to their referents 
and that there is an “experienced unity of sign [expression] and thing signified [referent].” That 
is, the expression and referent are experienced as united into a whole. 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
experience, Husserl would be saying that people first speak or write, and only subsequently mean or intend the 
objects about which they are speaking or writing. In the rest of §10, furthermore, Husserl continues to focus on the 
reader’s point of view. 
16 See Sokolowski, PA, ch. 10. 
17 Panzer notes (Hua XIX, 46, n. 1) that in the first edition of Logische Untersuchungen, Husserl had 
included the following clause at the end of the quotation’s final sentence: “genauer zwischen sinnbelebter 
Zeichenerscheinung und sinnerfüllendem Akt” (“more precisely, between the sense-animated sign-appearance and 
the sense-filling act [i.e., the intuition of the meant object]”). That Husserl deleted this clause for the second edition 
suggests that Husserl came to the conclusion either that it was not, in fact, a more precise way of putting the issue, or 
else that it was not a helpful way of putting the clause more precisely. 

16 
 
We can see that Husserl has the unity of a whole, not an aggregate, in mind here through 
his description of the hearer’s passiveness in the experience. Hearing the expression “awakens” 
the hearer’s meaning-intention, directed at the expression’s referent. The expression can do this 
because it “points to” the referent, rather than being pointed to the referent by the hearer. 
Furthermore, as we just saw, we experience the unity of expression and referent (Hua XIX, 
46/1:193), rather than experiencing ourselves as imposing a unity on the two (as with an 
aggregate). 
We have, therefore, encountered two descriptions of the relationship between expression 
and referent in §10. First, Husserl said the relationship between expression and referent is 
“asymmetrical” (Hua XIX, 45–46/1:193). In this part of his discussion, Husserl seems to be 
focusing on the speaker’s or writer’s experience. Second, Husserl described an “experienced 
unity” between the expression and referent (Hua XIX, 46/1:193). In this part of the discussion, 
Husserl is focusing on the hearer’s or reader’s point of view. We, who are both writers and 
readers, hearers and speakers, therefore, experience the sign and referent as united into a whole, 
though we experience the relationship as being asymmetrical.18 Furthermore, though we 
experience the two as united, the relationship between them is “unrealized” if we do not have an 
accompanying intuition of the referent (Hua XIX, 44/1:192).  
Since we experience the unity between an expression and its referent as the unity of a 
whole, we must now ask whether this is the unity of part with part or of part with whole. If we 
experienced the relation as that of a part to its whole, we would expect it to seem 
“asymmetrical,” whereas, if we experienced the relation as that between two parts within a larger 
whole, we would expect it to seem “symmetrical.” Therefore, our initial presumption must be 
                                                           
18 See pp. 25–26, below. 

17 
 
that—on Husserl’s account—we experience expressions as parts of their referents. To further 
explore this issue, however, we must turn to §§6 and 7 of Investigation VI, where Husserl once 
again takes up the subject of expressions and fulfillment.  
c. Investigation VI, §6 
To clarify the nature of what he calls “static” fulfillment in Investigation VI, §6, Husserl 
employs the example of an inkpot,19 describing a situation in which the meaning-intention that 
animates the expression “my inkpot” is based on an intuition of the inkpot (Hua XIX, 
558/2:201). In this example, we are dealing with an expression for the object itself, rather than 
with an expression of some property of the object. We are not bringing out the identity of some 
part of the object, but are instead bringing out the identity of the whole.  
From the speaker’s point of view, the expressed object is both meant and present in 
“static” fulfillment. In such fulfillment, Husserl says, the expression “names the object of my 
percept,” “seems to overlay [“legt sich . . . auf”]” it, and “belong sensibly [gehört sozusagen 
fühlbar] to it” (Hua XIX, 558–59/2:201). He then, however, adopts a point of view from outside 
the experience. From that stance, we see that the expression is not ingredient in (a) the physical 
“context” to which the referent belongs, or the physical content of which the referent consists 
(Hua XIX, 559/2:201). Why, then, does it seem to us from inside the experience that the fulfilled 
expression “overlays” and “belongs to” its referent? It is because, in addition to the intuitions of 
the referent and the expression, there is a third act that joins them together. This is the act of 
                                                           
19 The topic of inkpots comes up also in §2 of Edmund Husserl, “Anschauung und Repräsentation, 
Intention und Erfüllung,” in Aufsätze und Rezensionen (1890–1910), ed. Bernhard Rang, Husserliana XXII (The 
Hague: Nijhoff, 1979), 269–302; Aufsätze und Rezensionen henceforth cited as Hua XXII with German and English 
page references respectively. English translation: “Intuition and Repräsentation, Intention and Fulfilment,” in Early 
Writings in the Philosophy of Logic and Mathematics, trans. Dallas Willard, Edmund Husserl: Collected Works, vol. 
5 (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1994), 313–44; henceforth cited as “Intuition and Repräsentation” and Early Writings, 
respectively. (We will study §3 of “Intuition and Repräsentation” below.)  

18 
 
“recognition,” in which the intuited object is seen to be the kind of object to which the intuited 
word refers (Hua XIX, 559/2:201–2). He concludes: 
[I]n so far as the act of meaning is most intimately one with an act of classification, and 
this latter, as recognition of the perceived object, is again intimately one with the act of 
perception, the expression seems to be applied to the thing and to clothe it like a garment 
[als dem Dinge aufgelegt und als wie sein Kleid]. (Hua XIX, 559/2:202)  
Standing outside the experiences in question, we see that our mental acts unite with each other. 
Within the experience, this unification gives rise to the expression’s seeming to be lain out upon 
the object like its clothing.  
What, however, is the nature of this experienced relation between expression and 
referent? We have already seen that hearers and readers experience expressions as 
mereologically united with their referents. More specifically, it seemed that we experience the 
expression as a part of the referent. Now we can say the same seems to be true for those who 
experience the fulfillment of expressions, given Husserl’s talk of expressions seeming to 
“overlay,” “belong sensibly to,” be “applied to,” and “clothe” their referents. Husserl’s 
description portrays the unity as being too intimate for an aggregate. We experience the sign and 
referent as fitting together of their own accord, as it were, rather than experiencing ourselves as 
imposing unity upon them. We must experience the unity, then, as that of a whole. Furthermore, 
as before, the relation appears asymmetrical, with the referent being more substantive, and the 
expression being more like adornment (which, nevertheless, fits the referent like a glove). These 
descriptions, once again, seem to match the experience of a part’s unifying with its whole, rather 
than that of two parts uniting into a larger whole. 
 

19 
 
d. Investigation VI, §7 
In §7, Husserl turns to the examination of words that refer to the properties of objects, 
rather than referring to the identity of objects. He writes that when we recognize something as 
red, the word “red” does not simply refer to the color property of the object, but rather “names” 
the object itself “as red.” Furthermore, it does not just belong to the color of the object, but “it 
belongs to this object” because of its color (Hua XIX, 561/2:203).20 We can explain this as 
follows. 
The property Husserl uses in his example—red—is the type of part that Husserl calls a 
“moment.” That is, it is founded on other parts of the whole to which it belongs. Such a part 
cannot be recognized without also noticing the whole to which it belongs (Hua XIX, 246/2:13–
14). When, therefore, we are struck by some red, and recognize it as red, we cannot help but 
recognize it as belonging to some larger whole. Thus, though we experience the word “red” as 
belonging to the red property we see, we also experience it as belonging to the object that is red. 
Husserl takes up this issue of “belonging” next, repeating a familiar theme. 
 
We observe first that the word does not attach externally, and merely through 
hidden mental mechanisms, to the individual, specifically similar traits of our intuitions. 
                                                           
20 In this regard, see the following passage from Husserl’s unpublished essay, “Zur Logik der Zeichen 
(Semiotik),” in Hua XII, 340–73; henceforth cited as “Logik der Zeichen” with German and English page references 
respectively. English translation: “On the Logic of Signs (Semiotic),” in Early Writings, 20–51. “Any proper name 
is a direct sign, any general name is indirect. In fact, the general name designates the object under mediation of 
certain conceptual marks. The adjective ‘red’ directly designates being-red (including the abstractum red as a 
metaphysical part), which, precisely, can then serve as the signitive mark for the object itself—although other 
conditions must be added in order to make the designation univocal. All multivocal signs which connote a 
determinate range of multivocality are indirect; for such a connotation can only come about through a general mark 
or property, which thus mediates between the sign and the designated.  
“In the case of indirect signs it is necessary to distinguish: that which the sign signifies (bedeutet) and that 
which it denotes (bezeichnet). With direct signs the two coincide. The signification of a proper name, for example, 
consists just in the fact that it names precisely this determinate object. With indirect signs, on the other hand, there 
are intermediaries between the sign and fact; and the sign designates the fact precisely through these intermediaries, 
which therefore constitute the signification. . . . [T]he signification of the general name, for example, consists in this: 
that it denotes some object on the basis of and by means of certain conceptual properties which the object possess” 
(“Logik der Zeichen,” 343–44/23). (The essay is from 1890 or 1891; “On the Logic of Signs (Semiotic),” 23, n. 1.) 

20 
 
It is not enough, manifestly, to acknowledge the bare fact that, wherever such and such an 
individual trait appears in our intuition, the word also accompanies it as a mere pattern of 
sound. A mere concomitance, a mere external going with or following on one another 
would not forge any internal bond among them, and certainly not an intentional bond. Yet 
plainly we have here such an intentional bond, and one of quite peculiar 
phenomenological character. The word calls the thing red. The red appearing before us is 
what is referred to by the name, and is referred to as ‘red’. In this mode of naming 
reference, the name appears as belonging [gehörig] to the named and as one with it [und 
mit ihm eins]. (Hua XIX, 561/2:203).  
The unity, in other words, between the word for a property of some object and that property itself 
is not the unity of an aggregate. It is much more intimate, involving “belonging” and being 
“one.” But if we experience the expression as “one with” a property of an object—that is, a part 
of an object21—and as also belonging to the object as a whole, surely we must also experience 
the expression as a part of the object. 
e. The Original Passage 
Behind Investigation VI, §§6 and 7, lies a portion of Husserl’s unpublished essay (of ca. 
1893),22 “Intuition and Repräsentation” (Hua XXII, 269–302/313–44). In §3 of that essay, 
Husserl describes the experience of seeing an object that has a property, of recognizing that 
property, and of explicitly identifying the property in question using the appropriate predicate. 
                                                           
21 Husserl writes: “Every non-relative ‘real’ (reale) predicate, therefore points to [weist . . . hin] a part of 
the object which is the predicate‘s subject: ‘red’ and ‘round’, e.g., do so, but not ‘existent’ or ‘something’” (Hua 
XIX, 231/2:5). 
22 For the date of this essay, see Early Writings, 313, n. 1. 

21 
 
When recognizing a property of a perceptually-present object brings its name to mind (Hua XIX, 
286/329), Husserl writes: 
My impression is completely as if the word overlay [aufgelegt] the named in the manner 
of a quality, in accordance with the intended (signified) Moments, and in fusion with 
them [mit diesen verschmolzen wäre]—wholly as a tactile quality appears to suffuse 
[überziehen] a visual object, in that it is, as it were fused with certain visual Moments 
(glossiness, roughness, and the like). (Hua XIX, 286/330). 
What we see here is Husserl describing the experience of an expression uniting with its first and 
immediate referent (the property to which it refers) as an experience of (a) two parts uniting 
within the whole to which that referent belongs, and (b) the expression uniting with its mediate 
referent (the object to which the property belongs, and which the expression “names” as so 
propertied) as a part with its whole. This latter he describes as an experience of the expression’s 
“overlaying” its mediate referent like a “quality” (i.e., a property). 
Husserl’s discussion in “Intuition and Repräsentation,” §3 of how a word for a property 
seems to “overlay” the object to which its referent belongs is recapitulated in Investigation VI, 
§§6 and 7. The terminology in the earlier passage of an expression’s “overlaying” an object is 
repeated in Investigation VI, §6, but in reference to an expression of the type of object in 
question (rather than of some property of the object). The discussion of expressions for 
properties can then be found in Investigation VI, §7. Where Husserl had said in “Intuition and 
Repräsentation,” §3, that the expression seems to “fuse” with the property to which it refers, he 
says in Investigation VI, §7, that the expression seems to be “one with” that property.

Table 1 
The accounts in the three passages we have studied are basically the same. First, 
Husserl’s account of expressions that refer to the properties of objects does not seem to have 
changed between “Intuition and Repräsentation” and Logical Investigations. The difference 
between E1 and E3 above seems to be a matter of synonymy, and we can fill in F3 with “seems 
to be part of object,” on the strength of E3. (If something seems to “belong to” and be “one with” 
some property of an object, then surely it also seems to be part of the object. After all, it seems to 

23 
 
belong to and be one with something that is a part of the object.) Then, given the other parallels, 
we would seem justified in filling in gap at D3 with “seems to overlay object,” from D1. 
But what of line 2? The gap at E2 cannot be filled in. The expression refers not to any 
property of the object, but to the object itself. However, we should explain the difference 
between F1 and F2 as simply another case of synonymy. First, Husserl does not seem to draw 
much of a distinction (other than the obvious one at E2) between using an expression to refer to 
an object’s property and using an expression to refer to an object’s identity. Second, Husserl’s 
emphasis on the asymmetrical mereological unity we experience between expressions and their 
referents fits the part-to-whole relation better than the part-to-part relation. And third, what else 
could “x seems to belong sensibly to y” (Hua XIX, 558–59/2:201) mean—especially given that 
we experience the two as mereologically united—other than “x seems to be a property or part of 
y”?  
In general, therefore, Husserl thinks of our experience of the relation between expressions 
and their referents in terms of an experience of a part’s being united with a whole. When we are 
referring to the identity of an object, the expression refers directly to this whole. When we are 
referring to some property of an object, the expression refers indirectly to this whole. In either 
case, the whole to which the expression seems to belong is on the side of the referent. With 
indications, in contrast, we experience both the indication and its referent as parts of a larger 
whole that belongs neither to the sign-side, nor to the referent-side, of the relationship. It seems, 
as it were, distributed equally across the relationship.  
b. Generalizing Our Results 
In the analysis above, we saw Husserl describing both the experience of hearers and 
readers, as well as the experience of speakers and (perhaps) writers. Likewise, we also saw him 

24 
 
describing the experience of static fulfillment. Are we justified in generalizing our results such 
that they apply equally to the experience of hearers and readers, and to the experience of 
speakers and writers? Likewise, are we justified in generalizing our results such that they apply 
equally to the experience of static fulfillment and dynamic fulfillment? Finally, are we justified 
in generalizing our results such that they apply not only to fulfilled expressions, but also to 
unfulfilled expressions? The answer to each of these questions, I would argue, is “yes.” 
First, a speaker is—unless deaf or in some otherwise unusual situation—always also a 
hearer, as Derrida has pointed out (SP, ch. 6). To speak is also to hear oneself speak. Much the 
same can be said for the writer. For instance, as I type this essay, I am also automatically reading 
what I type. Furthermore, to hear or read is to join with the speaker or writer in giving meaning 
to the expressions used, by engaging in meaning-intentions directed at the referents of the 
expressions. Thus, the speaker and hearer are both hearing the same words—or the writer and 
reader are both reading the same words—and giving meaning to them by engaging in meaning-
intentions aimed at their referents.23 Therefore, an expression has a relation to a referent for both 
speaker and hearer, writer and reader, it has this relation because of the meaning given to it by 
our meaning-intentions as either speaker or hearer, writer or reader, and this relation is realized 
or actualized in the experience of fulfillment for both speakers and hearers, writers and readers. 
Thus, Husserl’s mereological analysis of the experience of expressions for a hearer or reader 
should apply just as well to the experience of expressions for a speaker or writer.24 
Furthermore, Husserl writes that static fulfillment is equivalent to “the lasting outcome” 
of dynamic fulfillment (Hua XIX, 567–68/2:207). That is, both dynamic and static fulfillment 
                                                           
23 See Hua XIX, Investigation I, §7 and 46/1:193 (cf. §8), and Sokolowski, PA, ch. 10. 
24 On the differences, see §6, below. 

25 
 
end up amounting to the same thing. Thus, Husserl’s analysis of the experience of expressions 
relative to static fulfillment should apply just as well to the experience of expressions relative to 
dynamic fulfillment. 
Finally, Husserl says that fulfillment “actualizes” or “realizes” the relation between an 
expression and its referent, but that relation is still there, in an unactualized or “unrealized” state, 
outside of fulfillment. The experience of fulfillment “confirms” the relationship that was already 
present (Hua XIX, 44/1:192). Furthermore, his description of our experience of the relation 
between expression and referent as being one of asymmetrical unity is presented as holding 
outside fulfillment (Hua XIX, 46/1:193). Thus, Husserl’s mereological analysis of the experience 
of fulfilled expressions should apply as well to our experience of expressions outside fulfillment.  
c. Standardizing Our Results 
It would seem, then, that Husserl thinks of our experience of the relationship between 
expressions and their referents in terms of the experience of the relationship between parts and 
their wholes. However, in the passages we saw above, the whole in question was sometimes the 
immediate referent of the expression (when expressions referred to the identity of an object) and 
sometimes the mediate referent of the expression (when expressions referred to some property of 
an object). In the latter cases, do we experience the relationship between the expression and its 
immediate referent (the property in question) as a relationship between two parts (the expression 
and the property) within a whole (the object), or as a relation between a part (the expression) and 
its whole (the property), which is, in turn, a part of a larger whole (the object)?  
Husserl does not attempt to answer this question, perhaps because his ultimate goal was 
to explore the nature of meaning (see Investigation II) and rationality (see Investigation VI), 
rather than to provide a thorough examination of expressions. The basically mereological nature 

26 
 
of our experience of expressions was clear enough, so Husserl could move on to what, for his 
purposes, were more pressing issues. Since we are trying to clarify and develop Husserl’s 
understanding of signs, however, we need to make explicit and consistent what Husserl left 
implicit and ambiguous. Thus, whether or not Husserl recognized this, a full and consistent 
Husserlian semiotics will have to claim that we experience the unity between all expressions and 
their (immediate) referents as a unity between parts their wholes, for the following reasons. 
(1) On Husserl’s account, our experience of the relationship between an expression and 
its referent must differ from our experience of the relationship between an indication and its 
indicated-object. Otherwise, we would experience the two types of sign in the same way, and 
would not experience them as different types of sign. That is, we would experience both as 
indicating their objects, or both as meaning their objects. 
(2) Furthermore, the relationship between an expression and its referent must be the 
same, no matter what type of referent is in question. Otherwise, the relationship between some 
expressions and their referents would be different from that between other expressions and their 
referents; some expressions would “point to” their referents in different ways than other 
expressions “point to” theirs. And this would mean that some expressions are not expressions, 
but some other type of sign.  
 (3) Some passages in the Investigations imply that we experience the relationship 
between an expression and its referent as a relationship between a part and its whole, and yet 
others—let us call them “problem passages”—can bear the reading that we experience the 
relationship between an expression and its referent as a relationship between two parts within the 
larger whole to which the referent physically belongs. 

27 
 
(4) However, we could read the “problem passages” as follows. We can say that we 
experience an expression (e.g., “red”) and its referent (e.g., some object’s property of redness) as 
being two parts that belong to the object to which the referent belongs (e.g., some red object), 
and say that we also experience the expression as a part of its referent (e.g., “red” as part of the 
object’s redness). After all, a part of a part is also a part of the whole to which the part belongs 
(Hua XIX, 274/2:30).  
(5) Reading the “problem passages” in this way would allow us to explicate and develop 
a Husserlian theory of signs in a way that is consistent with both (1) and (2) above. 
d. Do We Experience Expressions as Moments or 
Pieces? 
A consistent Husserlian semiotics, therefore, will hold that we experience an indication as 
united with what it indicates as two parts within a whole, and an expression as united with its 
referent as a part with its whole. In §3b, above, we asked how far Husserl’s explicit mereological 
theory from Investigation III was capable of accommodating the phenomenology of indications, 
and discovered that it was useful, but may not be fully adequate. It is now time we ask the same 
question with regard to our experience of expressions. Specifically, can we say whether we 
experience expression signs (1) as being founded by one or more (non-sign) parts of their 
referents, (2) as founding one or more (non-sign) parts of their referents, or (3) as, together with 
one or more (non-sign) parts of their referent, founding some other part of their referents?  
We can eliminate option (2) immediately. We do not experience any (non-sign) part of 
the referent as founded upon the expression. I experience the Eiffel Tower as having already 
been there with all its physical parts when I first recognize it for what it is, and call it by its 
name. I do not experience any of its parts as depending for its existence on the name I use. 

28 
 
We are left, therefore, with options (1) and (3). In option (1), we experience the 
expression as a moment of the referent—that is, as a part that cannot exist without some (non-
sign) part of the referent existing to found it. It is difficult to imagine, however, how such a 
hypothesis could explain the functioning of expressions for non-existent or imaginary objects. 
Could we experience something that exists—the expression we speak or write—as being 
founded on the existence of something that we do not experience as existing? This seems 
unlikely to me. Might it be that when we have a prior belief that something is non-existent or 
imaginary, we must imaginatively intend it (for the moment) as existing to be able to speak of it? 
Given these questions, the most promising hypothesis may be option (3). In it, we 
experience the expression as a “piece” of its referent. It is “separately presentable” (Hua XIX, 
Investigation III, §6) and yet we experience it as part of its referent. This would mean, however, 
that we experience it as helping to found a “moment of unity” with some part(s) of its referent 
(see Hua XIX, Investigation III, §§21–22).  
If indeed we experienced expressions as pieces of their referents, what would we make of 
Husserl’s claim that “an expression’s meaning . . . pertains to it essentially” (Hua XIX, 42/1:190) 
and that “[r]elational talk of . . . ‘meaning’ and ‘object’ belongs essentially to every expression” 
(Hua XIX. 56/1:199). If we experience expressions as pieces of their referents, do not we 
experience them as being essentially separable from their referents, rather than, as it were, as 
being essentially tied to a meaning and a referent? 
The answer to this question is that to experience something as an expression, we must 
experience it as having a meaning, and thus as being directed to some referent. However, the 
“expression physically regarded (the sensible sign, the articulate sound-complex, the written sign 
on paper etc.)” only takes on a meaning, and hence a referent, because it is animated by the 

29 
 
sense-giving mental acts of some subject (Hua XIX, 38/1:188). Independent of those acts, the 
expression is a mere physical mark (e.g., an “arabesque” [Hua XIX, 115/1:161]), an object (e.g., 
a chunk of marble carved, or pieces of metal molded, into the shape of a word), or a sound. To 
experience something as an expression is to experience it as having a meaning, and hence a 
referent, and yet as being something whose physical side could exist independently of that 
meaning, and separately from that referent. Likewise, to experience something as a piece is to 
experience it as a part of a whole, and yet as being something that could exist independently of, 
and separately from, that whole. It is part of the essence of a piece, qua piece, that it be a part of 
a whole, and yet it is possible for a piece, as a whole of its own, to exist independently of, and 
separately from, any larger whole. 
Finally, there is a case to be made (see Appendix I) that we experience expressions as 
being parts of their referents in a way that the basic distinction between “moment” and “piece” 
(Hua XIX, Investigation III, §17) may not fully capture. That is, it may be that Investigation III’s 
theory of parts and wholes must be expanded or nuanced to account for types of part that it 
currently overlooks or conflates with moments and pieces. If this were the case, it would be but 
another instance of the freedom of the phenomenologist, whose job it is to be faithful to the 
phenomena, rather than to any particular theory. Investigation III’s theory of parts and wholes 
may be the first word in mereology for the phenomenologist, but it need not be the only word. 
e. Expressive Experience Is Grounded in 
Mereological Experience 
Setting aside for the time being the question of whether we experience expressions as 
parts in the sense of moments, in the sense of pieces, or in some other sense, we return to the 
basic fact (if the account above is correct) that we experience expressions as parts of their 

30 
 
referents. But do we experience an expression as a part of its referent because we experience it as 
an expression of its referent, or do we experience the two as expression and referent because we 
experience one as a part of the other? And, furthermore, can we experience anything as a part of 
some other thing without experiencing one as an expression and the other as its referent? 
We may answer the last question first. It is clear that our experience of things as parts of 
wholes is much wider than our experience of things as expressions of referents. I experience the 
whiteness of the paper as a part of the paper, but not as an expression of it. I experience the 
wheel of a car as a part of the car, but not as an expression of it. Experiencing something as a 
part of something else is not a sufficient condition for experiencing it as an expression of that 
thing (see Appendix 1, below). The mereological aspect of our experience of expressions, 
however, is a necessary condition of that experience, as we will now see.  
We asked above whether (a) we experience an expression as a part of its referent because 
we experience it as an expression of its referent, or (b) we experience the two as expression and 
referent because we experience one as a part of the other. Husserl seems to choose the latter 
option, at least for readers and hearers. As readers and hearers, expressions point to their 
referents because we first experience them as united with their referents. And it is only because 
of this experienced unity and pointing that we take the thing in question as an expression—as 
something meaningful—infusing it with meaning through a meaning-intention (Hua XIX, 
46/1:193). Thus, the reader or hearer’s expressive experience is grounded in mereological 
experience. To experience something as an expression of some referent, one must first 
experience the two as united in the manner of a whole. 
I believe we should say the same of the speaker’s or writer’s experience of expression, 
though Husserl himself does not mention it in Logical Investigations. There will, furthermore, be 

31 
 
a kind of reversal compared to the hearer’s or reader’s experience. While a reader sees marks on 
a page, and a hearer hears sounds, that point him or her to some object, a writer does not usually 
start making marks, nor a speaker usually start making sounds, and then find them directing him 
or her to a referent. One does not normally find oneself talking or writing, and then have to 
figure out what one is talking or writing about. One normally has something about which one 
wishes to say something and then begins to talk or write.  
Nevertheless, writers and speakers will experience the expressions they use as pointing to 
their referents because they experience the signs and referents as united with each other in the 
manner of a whole. A writer or speaker will have a referent in mind, experience it as united with 
one or more expressions, and have to select from among those expressions the one(s) that 
seem(s) fitting, or appropriate, to what she or he wants to say.25 This, however, will usually not 
be a matter for deliberation; normally, it will happen automatically, “by feel.” In the usual case, 
we find that what we want to say immediately fits one or more of the expressions we experience 
as united with the object, and, without really thinking about it, select those that we find fitting. 
(We have, however, all had the experience of wanting to say something about an object, of being 
unable to find “the right word” for it, and then, perhaps, of finally finding it.)26  
                                                           
25 This seems to echo the following. “A name is used referentially when we speak to someone else about 
the thing named; our words bring his mind to the subject. A name is used evocatively when we refrain from 
addressing someone else, when we let the name simply hold the object in focus for our own exploration. In 
evocation we invite the named object to suggest its appropriate words, and so become truthful, in us, but we do not 
speak to anyone” (Sokolowski, PA, 5). Cf. Sokolowski, PA, 71–72, 89–90, and Robert Sokolowski, Phenomenology 
of the Human Person (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 120. Henceforth cited as PHP. 
The idea that using signs is a process of making choices between signs was introduced to me (I believe) by 
John R. Pierce’s discussion of Claude Shannon’s information theory: John R. Pierce, An Introduction to Information 
Theory: Symbols Signals and Noise, 2nd rev. ed. (New York: Dover Publications, 1980); see, e.g., 42, 61–62; Claude 
E. Shannon and Warren Weaver, The Mathematical Theory of Communication (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois 
Press, 1998). The idea was later reinforced for me by Robert Sokolowski. 
26 See, e.g., Bennett L. Schwartz, Tip-of-the-Tongue States: Phenomenology, Mechanism, and Lexical 
Retrieval (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2002). The idea that words can be fitting not only to an 
object (see Husserl’s discussion of fulfillment in Investigation I, §§9–10) but also to a meaning-intention, and that 

32 
 
It seems to me, then, that something like the following usually occurs. One sees a ball, 
wishes to inform someone of its color, and experiences it as being united with sounds like “ball,” 
“sphere,” “orange,” and “rubber.” If one is in an “everyday” context, one will be more likely to 
select “ball” than “sphere,” and thus to say something like, “This ball is orange.” However, if 
one is in the context of a physics or engineering class, one might be more likely to select 
“sphere,” and say, “This sphere is orange.” Alternatively, if one wishes to inform someone else 
of the material of which the ball is made, one will select “rubber” instead of “orange,” and say, 
“This ball is rubber” or, “This sphere is rubber.”27 
In any event, encountering or using something as a meaningful sign—that is, as an 
expression—will depend on our experiencing it as mereologically united with its referent. The 
meaning-intention that gives it sense may be awakened by the experience of it as mereologically 
united with some referent (for readers and hearers) or may have to “search out” a fitting mark or 
sound from among those we experience as mereologically united with the referent (for writers 
and speakers). However, in either case, our experience of something as a meaningful expression 
will depend upon our experiencing it as mereologically united with some referent. As with 
indications, in other words, expressive experience is grounded in mereological experience.  
f. Intermediate Results regarding the Nature of 
Signs 
Is Derrida’s understanding of signs as present replacements for absent objects adequate to 
account for our experience and employment of expressions? The answer, we can now say, is, 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
finding the right word for what one wants to say can be seen as a kind of fulfillment, I owe to Robert Sokolowski. 
(Cf. his discussion of “the unnamed” in PHP, 154.) 
27 Cf. Sokolowski’s discussion of having to choose the appropriate words for one’s interlocutor (PA, 5–6). 

33 
 
“Not if we are following Husserl.” What we have found in Logical Investigations simply does 
not match what Derrida claims to find there. Our experience of both indicative and expressive 
signs is grounded in mereological experience, not in the experience of substitution and 
replacement.28  
§6. A Unified Account of Indications and Expressions 
Readers of Investigation I could be forgiven for coming away with the impression that 
indications and expressions may both be called “signs,” but that there is ultimately no unity to 
the genus sign. Indications are not expressions, nor expressions indications, but what exactly 
makes them both specifications of a single generic essence is unclear. Derrida’s theory that being 
a sign—of whatever type—for something means standing in for that thing, does the reader the 
service of suggesting that perhaps there is a unity to the genus. The theory I have been 
expounding above—arguing that it is the theory implicit in Husserl’s discussion of indications 
and expressions—likewise argues that there is a unity to the genus sign. For one thing to be 
experienced as a sign for something else—and thus for it to be a sign of something else (Hua 
XIX, 31–32/1:184, 46/1:193)—is grounded in the thing’s being experienced as mereologically 
united with that other thing. The distinction between the two main categories of signs, then, is 
grounded in the differing ways in which we can experience the sign and its referent as 
mereologically united.  
                                                           
28 Gadamer writes: “In the earliest times the intimate unity of word and thing was so obvious that the true 
name was considered to be part of the bearer of the name, if not indeed to substitute for him.” However, “Belief in 
the word and doubt about it constitute the problem that the Greek Enlightenment saw in the relationship between the 
word and thing. Thereby the word changed from presenting the thing to substituting for it.” Hans-Georg Gadamer, 
Truth and Method, 2nd rev. ed., trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall (New York: Continuum, 2006), 
406. Henceforth cited as TM. If Gadamer is correct, Derrida propounds the later understanding of signs, while 
Husserl reveals the phenomenological motivation behind the original understanding. 

34 
 
To this point, we have been engaged primarily with static descriptions of the experience 
of indication and expression. However, we have also employed some dynamic analyses, and it is 
time we gave this approach its full due. In doing so, the unity of the genus sign will come out in 
a new and striking fashion. 
a. The Receiver’s Experience of Indications and 
Expressions 
Husserl argues that our experience of indications grows out of our experience of 
associations between things. In this experience of association, we experience indications and 
what they indicated as united in such a way that we can experience one as indicating the other. I 
would suggest that something similar occurs in the case of expressions. Association, or 
something like association29 (informed by our experiences of other expression-like things; see 
Appendix 1) leads us to experience expressions and their referents as unified in such a way that 
we can encounter the expressions as referring to their referents.  
So, in both our experience of indications and our experience of expressions, we begin 
from an experience of the sign and its referent as unified, and this motivates a certain belief (in 
the case of indications) or awakens a meaning-intention (in the case of expressions). How, 
precisely, should we describe the shift from experiencing a sign as united with its referent, to 
taking it as an indication of that referent, or to infusing it with a sense such that it now means 
that referent? The shift, if it occurs, will usually happen so quickly that it may be difficult to 
tease apart the two stages. However, I suggest that it would involve moving from the vague 
awareness that the two are united in the manner of a whole, to the more distinct awareness of the 
sign and referent as two parts of the same whole, or of the sign as a part of the referent.  
                                                           
29 Cf. Sokolowski’s discussion of association eliciting vocalization in PA, 3–4. 

35 
 
To clarify these claims, it would be helpful to understand the hearing of a spoken, or 
“vocal,” sign, as falling into five stages. 
 
1. We do not hear the sound. 
 
 
2a. We hear the sound, but do not notice it. 
 
2b. We hear the sound, and notice it. 
 
3. We experience the sound as either indicating some object,  
or meaning some object. 
 
 
Basis: We experience the sound vaguely as uniting with 
something else in the manner of a whole. 
 
4a. We experience the sound as merely 
indicating some object. 
 
4b. We experience the sound as  
meaning some object. 
Basis: We experience the sound distinctly 
as united with some absent object as  
two parts within a whole 
 
Basis: We experience the sound distinctly 
as united with some object as  
a part with its whole.30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5a. We understand what object the  
sound is indicating. 
5b. We understand what object the  
sound means 
Figure 1. 
I believe that Figure 1 lays out the basic structure of our experience of vocal signs. Since 
we can and do sometimes find ourselves called up short at any one of the stages listed in Figure 
                                                           
30 See Appendix 1, below, for a fuller description of this experience. 

36 
 
1, we must say that each is part of the experience of vocal signs at least potentially. However, 
various stages often will be “combined” with others, as when we hear and notice the sound 
simultaneously,31 or when in noticing the sound we can immediately tell that it is a word (an 
expression) not a mere noise (an indication).  
Let us examine a concrete example. Walking down the street, we hear a shout. If we are 
deeply absorbed in something else, it might take a moment for the sound to register. In any case, 
it does, and we have moved from stage 1 to stage 2b.32 The shout is indistinct, however, and we 
cannot tell at first whether it is an inarticulate cry of alarm, or perhaps some word or other. Thus, 
we become temporarily stuck at stage 3. In stage 3, we experience the sound as mereologically 
united with something else, but it is ambiguous whether this is the unity of two parts within an 
overarching whole, or that of a part with its whole.  
After a moment, it sinks in: what we have just heard is a word; perhaps it had too many 
syllables, or the wrong kind of consonants, to be a mere vocal outburst. Whatever the case, we 
have moved to stage 4b. “Beneath” this move is a shift to experiencing the mereological unity 
between the sound and the other indeterminate thing as that between a part and its whole.  
However, what kind of word we have just heard remains unclear. Was it a name, an 
instruction, a question, etc.? It then clicks: what we have heard is a name. Evidently, the person 
is calling out to someone else; we experience the sound as a part of some person, even if we do 
                                                           
31 See Husserl’s discussion of attention in Investigation V and Edmund Husserl, Erfahrung und Urteil: 
Untersuchungen zur Genealogie der Logik, red. und hrsg. Ludwig Landgrebe (Hamburg: Felix Meiner Verlag, 
1985), 24, 28, 79–84, etc.; English translation: Experience and Judgment: Investigations in a Genealogy of Logic, 
rev. and ed. Ludwig Landgrebe, trans. James Churchill and Karl Ameriks (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University 
Press, 1973), 30, 33, 76–79, etc. Henceforth cited as EU with German and English page references, respectively. 
There is a discussion somewhere in Husserl’s writings of hearing a sound before becoming aware of it, and then 
realizing that one was already hearing it. 
32 For an example of being stuck at stage 2, see Hua XIX, 398/2:105. 

37 
 
not know whom. We have moved to stage 5b. The type of whole (i.e., “person”) to which we 
experience the sound as belonging is now clear. 
In contrast, imagine that we are walking down the street and hear a noise. Our attention is 
immediately drawn to it, so we move from stage 1 to stage 2b. However, we are unsure at first 
whether it is was a human voice or the sound of machinery (or something to that effect). Thus, 
we become stuck at stage 3. In stage 3, once again, we experience the sound as mereologically 
united with something else, but it is ambiguous whether this is the unity of two parts within an 
overarching whole, or that of a part with its whole. 
Then, perhaps we hear an identical sound, and it becomes clear that what we have now 
heard twice is something inorganic. Thus, we move to stage 4a, taking it to be part of the 
working of some machine. “Beneath” this move is a shift to experiencing the mereological unity 
between the sound and the other indeterminate thing as that between two parts within an 
overarching whole. 
Finally, we realize that what we are hearing is the sound of squealing truck brakes (or 
train whistle, etc.). Thus, we have moved to stage 5a. The type of part to which we experience 
the sound as being united (within the overarching whole) becomes clear. 
If, in Figure 1, we change “sound” to “sound or mark,” and “hear” to “hear or see,” we 
can generalize the figure to cover cases of reading, in addition to cases of hearing. But what are 
we to say about the speaker’s or writer’s (the “signer’s”) experience? 
b. The Signer’s Experience of Indications and 
Expressions 
I would offer the following as an illustration of the unity of the signer’s dynamic 
experience of indications and expressions. 

38 
 
 
1. We are not aware of the object.
 
 
2a. We are aware of the object, without 
explicitly noting it.  
 
2b. We are aware of the object, and 
explicitly note it. 
 
3. We experience the object as something that could be either 
indicated or expressed (to others) 
 
 
Basis: We experience the object vaguely as uniting with one 
or more sounds or marks. 
 
4a. We experience the object as something 
to indicate (to others)33 
 
4b. We experience the object as something 
to express (to others) 
Basis: We experience the object distinctly 
as united with one or more sounds or  
marks as parts within a whole 
 
Basis: We experience the object distinctly 
as united with one or more sounds or  
marks as a whole with its parts. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5a. We select one of the available 
indications. 
5b. We select one of the available 
expressions. 
 
 
 
 
6a. We produce the selected indication. 
6b. We produce the selected expression. 
Figure 2. 
                                                           
33 We, unfortunately, do not have space here for exploring the role that others play in our experience of a 
thing as to-be-indicated or -expressed. See Sokolowski, PA, 5–11, 33, 35; PHP, 40, 58–65. 

39 
 
I believe that Figure 2, above, lays out the basic structure of our experience of signing 
(producing indications or expressions). Like Figure 1, various stages will often be “combined,” 
as when we become aware of and explicitly note an object simultaneously, or when in 
discovering that the object is something to be indicated we simultaneously select and produce an 
indication for it. But since we can and do find ourselves called up short at any one of the stages 
listed in Figure 2, we must say that each is part of the experience of signing at least potentially.  
The main question to answer regarding to Figure 2 is how it happens that we end up 
taking the object as something to indicate, rather than as something to express. This, surely, is 
not a choice about which we usually deliberate. Rather, it is, in the normal case, something we 
find ourselves as already having made. I believe the answer comes down to what we might call 
“distance.” Sokolowski argues that to name something, rather than merely indicating it, we must 
take a certain distance to it, implicitly understanding it as maintaining its identity (and 
nameableness) across both its presence to, and absence from, us (PA, 27–30.). To take something 
as something to indicate, on the contrary, requires no such distance.  
This difference in “distance” is reflected by the mereological nature of the situation. 
When we experience something as to be expressed, we experience it as a whole, standing over 
against us (as the object of our primary intention). We experience the sign we (will) produce as 
belonging to it, but the referent remains in its place, “there,” across from us. When we 
experience something as something to be indicated, however, we experience it as a part of a 
larger whole to which we experience the sign we (will) produce as also belonging. The whole is 
not the central object of our intention, and thus not something “there,” over against us. Rather, it 
seems to be something overarching, including both the referent “there” and the sign “here.” The 
whole seems to hang over our heads, as it were, as we focus on one of its parts (the thing to be 

40 
 
indicated) and produce the other (the indication). Our experience is something like being caught 
up in that whole, and not being given space to think and speak articulately. So, we cry out 
instead (see Sokolowski, PA, 24–27; PHP, 31).  
c. Conclusion 
The theory I have attempted to expound above provides an account of our experience of 
indications and expressions that is unified in two ways. In its static analysis, it explains the 
experienced connection between sign and referent for both indications and expressions using a 
single framework: that of mereological experience. In its dynamic analysis, it explains how 
mereological experience allows our encounters with, or employment of, indications and 
expressions to grow, or branch out from, a single stem. 
The account I have provided, though schematic, will provide scaffolding for elaborations 
and complexifications as the further work is done (see Appendices 1 and 2 below). Furthermore, 
it has advantages over two of the primary alternatives. The first, adopting a straightforward 
reading of Investigation I, states that there are two types of signs, one based on motivation and 
the other on meaning. This reading, while accurate, makes no attempt to explain the unity of the 
two species of signs within the broader genus sign. The second, adopting Derrida’s reading of 
Investigation I, states that all signs are substitutes, and there is, ultimately, only one type: 
indication (SP, 42). This reading, while inaccurate, does attempt to give a unified account of all 
signs. The theory expounded here, I believe, has the strengths of both alternatives, while 
remedying their weaknesses.

§7. Surrogative Signs 
Although discussions of Husserl’s theory of signs typically focus on indications and 
expressions, Investigation I also alerts us—almost in passing—to a third type of sign. Husserl’s 
summary treatment of “surrogative” signs in §20, however, masks their importance to his early 
philosophy of mathematics and logic. Thus, any fully developed Husserlian semiotics will 
eventually have to take them into account. 
a. Investigation I, §20 
In the opening of §20, Husserl is concerned his reader will misunderstand what it means 
to mean objects in their absence. When our referent is absent, our expressions do not take on a 
“surrogative function [stellvertretenden Funktion]” such that they now stand in for their referents 
(“für irgendetwas surrogierten”) as the focus of attention. Indeed, Husserl says, “Signs are . . . 
not objects of our thought at all, even surrogatively [in stellvertretender Weise]; we rather live 
entirely in the consciousness of meaning, of understanding” (Hua XIX, 73/1:210).  
Given this passage, it is surprising that Derrida would claim that to be a sign, for Husserl, 
is to be a present substitute for an absent referent. However, the rest of §20 shows Husserl does 
recognize one class of sign that seems to fit Derrida’s substitutionary theory. After calling 
attention to his discussion of mathematical signs in Philosophy of Arithmetic, Husserl writes, “In 
arithmetical thought mere signs genuinely do duty for concepts [surrogieren doch wirklich die 
bloßen Zeichen für die Begriffe]” (Hua XIX, 74/1:210). They do this because the rules of “the 
game of calculation” give them a “games-meaning [Spielbedeutung]” (in addition to their 
“original meaning”) (Hua XIX, 74/1:210–11). This he likens to “bits of ivory and wood” taking 
on “games-meanings” in chess, because of “the game’s rules” (Hua XIX, 74/1:210). Thus, he 
says, “signs taken in a certain operational or games-sense [Operations oder Spielbedeutung] do 

42 
 
duty [surrogieren] for the same signs in full arithmetical meaningfulness [arithmetisch 
bedeutsamen Zeichen]”34 (Hua XIX, 75/1:211). 
There are, therefore, two types of surrogation or substitution going on with arithmetical 
signs. When we are engaged in calculation, the mathematical signs we are using function as 
surrogates for “concepts” (e.g., for numbers [Hua XII, 81/85, 222/235]), and for themselves in 
their normal sense (e.g., when we take them as signs for numbers) (Hua XIX, 74–75/1:211–11). 
b. Final Results regarding the Nature of Signs 
It is particularly relevant for our purposes here to note Husserl’s insistence on the 
difference between taking signs in a surrogative, “games-meaning” fashion, and taking them in 
the normal, meaningful, way. Even in arithmetic, where signs usually function in a surrogative 
fashion (Hua XII, 257–58/272–73), they have this function because they first were designed to 
function in a non-surrogative fashion (Hua XIX, 237–39/251–53, 257–59/271–74). Furthermore, 
their essence as surrogative signs is not exhausted in their replacing the numbers they once 
represented. Rather, having done so, they now function as something like “counters in the . . . 
game” governed by rules that connect them with other signs (Hua XIX, 74/1:210–11).  
Given such facts, Mirja Hartimo argues that when we treat a sign as having a “games-
meaning,” we are treating it neither as an indication, nor as an expression (“Spielbedeutungen,” 
76). However, Hartimo claims, this means “Husserl’s own architectonics” of signs in Logical 
Investigations fails to accommodate surrogative signs (“Spielbedeutungen,” 76). If this were true, 
it would make it even harder to believe Derrida’s claim that for Husserl, all signs are ultimately 
surrogative signs. But is it true?  
                                                           
34 Findlay emphasizes both “arithmetical” and “meaningfulness,” but Husserl only “arithmetisch.”  

43 
 
When a sign begins to function surrogatively, its primary function ceases to be referring 
us to its referent. To be a surrogative sign, therefore, is in a sense, to have ceased to be a sign, 
and to have become something much more like a chess piece or other game token (Hua XIX, 
74/1:210). And yet, the sense of having been a proper sign remains as part of our experience of 
surrogative signs. The original meaning is “sedimented,” as J. Phillip Miller has argued, within 
such signs.35 Miller’s argument, furthermore, is supported by psychological research showing 
that people who have lost the ability to deal with numbers also lose the ability to work with 
numerals, even when those numerals should be functioning surrogatively.36 The original number 
reference is evidently still there, operative however vaguely and in the background, even as the 
numerals have taken center stage. Therefore, if that background reference is completely 
eliminated, we find the numeral no longer makes sense; it becomes unusable.  
How are we to explain this experience of the surrogative sign’s having taken pride of 
place from its original referent, and yet still being somehow connected with its referent such that 
it only makes sense in light of its referent? I would suggest we begin as follows. The relationship 
between a surrogative sign and its referent seems to have been flipped, or inverted. The sign, 
which is meant to direct attention away from itself to the referent, now stands in for the referent. 
The sign, rather than the referent, has become our main object. It occupies the center of our

attention, while its referent hangs on at the fringes of consciousness. This is, if not the mirror 
image of how we experienced the original sign-referent relationship, something very close to it. 
Let us assume, then, that our experience of the original relationship between a numeral—
the type of sign Husserl seems to have most in mind when discussing surrogation—is, in essence 
the same as our experience of the relationship between expressions and their referents. (After all, 
Husserl refers to “arithmetical signs” as originally having “arithmetical meanings” [Hua XIX, 
75/1:211] and it is expressions, not indications, that have meanings.) If, then, the relationship 
between the sign and its referent is inverted when we take the sign surrogatively, we would now 
say: we experience the (present) sign as the whole, and its (absent) referent as a mere part. If this 
is correct, it would help to explain our continued experience of a “sedimented” connection 
between the sign and its referent, even as we experience the original connection as having been 
radically altered, such that the sign now stands in place of its referent. 
This interpretation of our experience of surrogative signs would neatly round out our 
mereological understanding of Husserlian semiotics. To experience one thing as an indication of 
another is to experience the two as united as two parts within a whole. To experience one thing 
as an expression of another is to experience the former as a part, and the latter as that part’s 
whole. To experience something as a surrogative sign is to experience it as a whole to which its 
original referent belongs as a part. This would cover all three basic mereological relationships: 
part-to-part, part-to-whole, and whole-to-part. 
But perhaps this would be a little too neat. Perhaps further study of the nature of 
surrogative signs would reveal that surrogative signs’ standing in for their referents cuts off any 
relationship between them that we might experience in a mereological fashion. Even if this were 
the case, however, we could still explain surrogative signs mereologically. We would simply 

45 
 
need to shift our focus from the relation between the signs and their original referents, to the 
relations between the signs themselves. If we do this, we discover the following. 
We experience surrogative signs as signs for each other, when properly combined and 
arranged. For example, we experience “2 + 2” (or, at least “2 + 2 =”) as a sign for “4.” The 
givenness of the complex sign “2 + 2” (or “2 + 2 =”) indicates to us that there exists some 
solution numeral that is not currently given. Likewise we experience “2x + 4 = 8” as a sign for 
“2.” Once again, the givenness of the complex sign “2x + 4 = 8” indicates to us that there exists 
some solution numeral that is not currently given. 
 On this analysis, to be a surrogative sign would involve being a sign that has a 
sedimented sense like that of expressions, which we currently experience as functioning with the 
mereological structure of indications. We would experience surrogative signs as being initially 
parts of the wholes that were their original referents, but now as being parts (when arranged in 
the appropriate way) that are united with their new referents as parts within the same whole. Our 
experience of surrogative signs, then, would combine our experience of a sedimented part-to-
whole relationship with our experience of a current part-to-part relationship.37 This would, 
likewise constitute a “rounding out” of our mereological theory. 
It would require another essay to fully explore surrogative signs and test the above 
proposals. Until then, I must speak tentatively, though I believe the first proposal has merit, and 
am confident in the second. If either were confirmed, this would mean our experience of even the 
type of sign that seems to fit Derrida’s description is fundamentally mereological, enabling us to 
provide an ultimately unified account of all three types of sign recognized by Husserl. 
 
                                                           
37 This is true of expressive experience as well (see Appendix 1, below), but in a different way. 

46 
 
§8. Conclusion 
We began with comments from a pair of anthropologists who claim that being properly 
human boils down to a capacity for working with “symbols.” To better understand what symbols 
are, we turned to Derrida’s interpretation of signs as substitutes—an interpretation he claimed to 
find in Husserl. We have since seen, however, that a consistent Husserlian theory of signs would 
actually present our experience of signs as grounded in mereological, rather than substitutional, 
experience. The only possible exception to this rule involves our experience of surrogative signs, 
but even these, I suggested, should be understood in mereological terms.  
What I have tried to provide is a consistent, unified, mereological account of all three 
types of sign recognized by Husserl in Investigation I, and to do so—as much as is possible—on 
Husserl’s own terms. I may have to settle ultimately for a mereological account of indication and 
expression alone, but even this would constitute a significant step forward in understanding the 
unity of Husserlian semiotics. Furthermore, it would (1) make it possible to provide a fuller 
account of the genesis of semiotic experience out of our more fundamental, or “primal,” 
engagement with the world and its part–whole structures,38 and (2) provide a means for better 
understanding human nature, if being human fundamentally involves being engaged with signs.39  
Likewise, the theory expounded above should provide a new direction for research and 
debates about the relation between the cognitive abilities of humans, nonhuman animals, and 
machines. If an animal or machine is incapable of the types of mereological experience that 
                                                           
38 For some initial steps in this direction, see Appendix 1. See also the genetic phenomenology of judgment 
in Husserl’s EU. Sokolowski writes: “Two formal structures are everywhere present in Husserl’s philosophy: the 
contrast . . . between absence and presence, and the relationships between wholes and parts. Other formal structures, 
like . . . [the] relationship of sign and the signified, are defined with the help of the first two” (HM, 8). 
39 Even if there is more to being human than this alone; see Derek C. Penn, Keith J. Holyoak, Daniel J. 
Povinelli, “Darwin’s Mistake: Explaining the Discontinuity between Human and Nonhuman Minds,” Behavioral 
and Brain Sciences 31 (2008): 109–30, here 121–22.

ground semiotic experience, then it would be incapable of encountering and employing signs, as 
much as it might seem to act in a semiotic fashion. More specifically, if an animal or machine 
were incapable of experiencing the type of mereological experience necessary for experiencing 
expressions, we would be able to conclude that it was incapable of encountering or employing 
language qua language. 
Scientists who study animal behavior, neurology, and cognition would surely be able to 
design experiments for teasing out the nature of animal’s mereological experiences (assuming, as 
I do, that many species have such experiences).40 Computer cognition, however, is another issue. 
It is difficult for me to believe that computers understand the signs they encounter, but others 
seem to have no such difficulty.41 Perhaps progress in this debate might be made by asking 
whether computers encounter the signs with which they function in terms of parts and wholes. If 
they do, perhaps they can encounter some of those signs as expressions, and hence, perhaps they 
can understand some of them. If they do not, however, there would be no point in asking if they 
could understand the signs they encounter, since they would not be able to encounter them as 
signs. 
It is my hope, then, that the semiotic theory sketched above will provide impetus for a 
renewed interest in Husserl’s understanding of signs, a deeper investigation of the 
phenomenology of signs, and a more nuanced exploration of human, animal, and artificial 
cognition. 
                                                           
40 Unfortunately, however, I can find no scientific literature that even examines the issue (though this may 
be simply because I have been looking in the wrong places). 
41 See John Searle, “Minds, Brains, and Programs,” Behavioral and Brain Sciences 3 (1980): 417–24, with 
commentary and response (424–57). To settle this debate would require, at the very least, a more complete 
phenomenology of what exactly it means to experience one thing as a part, and another as a whole, than we have 
been able to provide here (see, e.g., Sokolowski, HM, chapter 1). 

48 
 
Appendix 1: Elaboration on the Character of Expressive Experience 
To experience one thing as an expression for another, we must experience it as a part of 
that other. And yet there must be more to our experience than this, or we would encounter 
everything that seems to us to be a part of some whole as being an expression for that whole. 
This Appendix will attempt to give a more thorough account of exactly what it is that we must 
“add,” as it were,  to our experience of one thing as part of another in order to experience that 
thing as an expression of the other. 
a. Five Traits of Expressive Experience  
What exactly is distinctive about our experience of expressions? First, we experience an 
expression as a kind of bridge between at least two wholes, because we experience it as being 
simultaneously a part of both wholes. The first whole is the referent to which the sign belongs. 
The second whole is constituted by the expression and the meaning-intentions of the subject who 
uttered or wrote it. Husserl says that the two are “phenomenally one with” each other “in the 
consciousness of the man who manifests them” (Hua XIX, 37/1:188). (This, I would argue, is 
connected with the phenomenon of finding an expression fitting for what one wants to say.) 
Hearers and readers also experience this whole, since the expression indicates to them the 
meaning-intention that animates it (Hua XIX, 39/1:189).42  
Second, we experience expressions as parts that we can make present at will, even when 
the object itself is absent.43 In contrast, consider the nature of a “normal” part. Here in North 
                                                           
42 But not to the speaker or writer, since the speaker or writer is engaged in those meaning-intentions, and 
hence they are not absent (Hua XIX, 43/1:191).  
43 This fact is related to Derrida’s claim that signs have typically been understood as present replacements 
or substitutes for absent referents, along with his emphasis on the will in expression (SP, 32–36). See also 
Sokolowski, PA, 25: “The sound is part of an attempt to make the object present, at least in fantasy. I bring about the 

49 
 
America, I cannot make any of the four legs of the Eiffel Tower physically present, and yet I can 
make the auditory analogue of, “the Eiffel Tower,” present whenever I wish, simply by speaking.  
Third, we experience each expression as a part that can be essentially identical to an 
infinite number of other parts of the same whole.44 We do not experience a chicken’s foot as 
being potentially identical with an infinite number of other parts of the same chicken, and yet we 
experience “rooster” as being essentially identical with “rooster,” “rooster,” and “rooster,” etc., 
which could all just as well be expressions for (i.e., seem to be parts of) the same chicken. 
Fourth, we experience many expressions as potentially belonging simultaneously to an 
indefinite number of wholes. After all, I could take the “rooster” in, “The rooster is a bird,” as an 
expression for all roosters at once. Any rooster’s left foot, however, could only be a part of at 
most one rooster, or perhaps two (e.g., in the case of conjoined twins), at any given time. 
And fifth, we experience expressions, in fulfillment, as belonging to and uniting with 
their referents. Husserl describes this as the sign’s “clothing” its referent (Hua XIX, 559/2:202). 
However, we also experience expressions as directing attention away from themselves to their 
referents in such a way that they (the expressions) cease to be the center of focus (Hua XIX, 45–
46/1:193). The spoken sound fades away,45 and the written sign is no longer seen, as our 
attention is directed toward the referent. Thus, in fulfillment, the expression seems to disappear 
(although it is retained in memory). These two aspects of our experience—the expression’s 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
items associated with the object which are in my power to bring about—and the sound is always mine to make—in 
the hope that the object will come too.” 
44 This is a point brought out by Derrida’s (SP, 41, 49–52, 57; cf. 6, 9–10) and Gadamer’s (TM, 394) talk of 
signs and “repetition” and Sokolowski’s discussion of consonants (PA, 68–69). Also, “When no one is saying the 
word ‘lamplight,’ it falls into a kind of latent existence; but when it is said again by someone, it returns as the very 
same word that was said before by him or by another speaker. It is not a similar word, but the same one” 
(Sokolowski, PA, 65). 
45 “Spoken words are almost insubstantial” (Sokolowski, PHP, 185). See, once again, Levinas on the 
window-like nature of expressions (“Work of Edmund Husserl,” 59). 

50 
 
seeming to be united with its referent, and its seeming to disappear—lead the experience of 
fulfillment to be an experience in which the expression seems to soak into, or be absorbed by, its 
referent.46 But this requires further discussion. 
b. Elaboration on the Fifth Trait 
In fulfillment, the expression “fuses” (Hua XXII, 286/339), or is one (Hua XIX 
561/2:203), with its referent, clothing (Hua XIX 559/2:202) and overlaying it (Hua XIX, 558–
59/2:201). However, since it directs attention away from itself and toward its referent, it fades 
away or slips from view. I suggest this experience of unity, in which one part seems to disappear, 
amounts to an experience of the referent’s seeming to absorb the sign. The predicate seems to 
soak into its referent, and thus to be a part of it.  
As an illustration, I suggest the following exercise. Looking directly at a physical object 
in your vicinity, correctly identify it, but apply an incorrect predicate. For example, looking at a 
white wall, you might say, “This wall is orange.” Then, repeat the sentence, but this time 
employing both the correct identification and the correct predicate. Go back and forth between 
the two sentences a few times, keeping your eyes fixed on whatever you are describing. 
You will notice, I believe, a certain tension whenever you predicate of the object falsely, 
and a certain relief of tension when you predicate of it correctly. The incorrect predicate will feel 
unfit, as if it does not belong.47 It will seem to hang in the air, as if rejected by the thing of which 
you are predicating, while the correct predicate will seem to disappear, as if it had been accepted 
and absorbed by the thing of which you are predicating.  
                                                           
46 And the relation we experience in fulfillment as being “actualized,” we experience as being there, though 
“unrealized” even outside of fulfillment (Hua XIX, 44/1:192; see p. 26, above). This, furthermore, would be true no 
matter to what type of object we find ourselves referring (see Appendix 2, below). 
47 This is the experience Husserl calls “frustration [Enttäuschung]” (Hua XIX, 574/2:211). 

51 
 
Once you have noticed the difference between the experiences of the two sentences, you 
will also begin to notice that the tension you feel regarding the incorrect sentence does not 
actually arise until the moment you reach the incorrect predicate. The part of the sentence 
involving the identification of the object will feel fitting. If you are looking at a brown chair, and 
say, “This chair is yellow,” only the “yellow” (or perhaps the “is yellow”) will feel as if it hangs 
in the air. The beginning of the sentence, “This chair,” will seem to fit, and soak into, the object. 
Similarly, you might look at a table, and identify it as a television, but correctly describe 
its shape. You might listen to a fan, correctly identify it as a fan, but incorrectly describe its 
sound (it actually hums, but you use the predicate “chirp”). Or, you might incorrectly identify it 
as a microwave, but correctly describe its sound. Or, you might both correctly identify it and 
correctly describe its sound. In going back and forth between these various versions of a 
sentence, you will experience different parts seeming to be accepted and rejected, to be absorbed 
and to hang in the air, to be fulfilled and frustrated. 
What is going on here? We are experiencing various levels of harmony and conflict 
between the object as we are intending it through the expression and the object as we are 
experiencing it perceptually. The experienced conflict leads to the erroneous part of the 
expression becoming prominent, drawing attention to itself, and remaining a center of focus, 
rather than directing attention away from itself. That is, when we experience a conflict between 
the object as perceived and the object as expressed, we also experience a second conflict between 
how the expression is functioning and how it is supposed to function. The expression is failing to 
express the object, and thus to direct attention away from itself. It is failing to achieve its telos, 
and in this failure is drawing attention to itself. This is why it seems to hang in the air, rather than 
being absorbed by its referent. 

52 
 
In contrast, when we experience harmony between the object as we perceive it and the 
object as we are expressing it, the expression we use seems to fit the referent, and to direct 
attention away from itself to the referent. The referent becomes the center of focus, and the 
expression fades out of our immediate perception (we cease to hear the words, or read the words, 
as we focus on the referent) and toward the periphery of consciousness. In this combination of 
fitting and fading, we have the experience of the referent as accepting or absorbing the 
expression.48 
I have emphasized fulfillment here because it shows the relation between expression and 
referent in its full actuality. It is a matter of teleology; we see most fully what a thing is in its 
achieving its telos.49 However, this relation is still there, in “unrealized” form, even outside 
fulfillment (Hua XIX, 44/1:192, 46/1:193).50 Furthermore, we have seen how we can experience 
an object as absorbing parts of our expression, but rejecting others. This leads us to the issue of 
complex expressions, with which we will deal in Appendix 2. 
c. Other Things that Seem Like Expressions 
To experience something as an expression is to experience it as a part of its referent, and 
this, I have been arguing, is to experience it (at least in fulfillment) as being absorbed, as it were, 
by its referent. A significant amount can be said to make the latter claim sound less exotic. Let us 
begin with the five traits of the experience of expressions that we identified earlier. 
                                                           
48 This, it seems to me, is true even if the referent itself also fades away. It still remains closer to the center 
of attention in retentional consciousness than does the expression-sign. 
49 See Francis Slade, “On the Ontological Priority of Ends and Its Relevance to the Narrative Arts,” in A. 
Ramos, ed., Beauty, Art, and the Polis (Washington, DC: The Catholic University of America Press/American 
Maritain Association, 2000), 58–69, here 58–59. 
50 See, once again, p. 26, above.

First, we experience expressions as parts that simultaneously belong to two wholes; the 
first whole is the referent of the sign, while the other part of the second whole is the meaning-
intention that animates the sign. Second, we experience expressions as being parts that can be 
made present at will, even in the absence of their wholes. Third, we experience expressions as 
being parts that are identical with a potentially infinite number of other parts of the same whole. 
Fourth, we experience at least some expressions as potentially being parts of an indefinite 
number of the same kind of whole simultaneously. And fifth, we experience expressions as being 
united with their referents, even while they disappear—that is, they seem to be absorbed by their 
referents—when we bring them to fulfillment. 
Now, we might ask, are there any other things that seem to share the above five 
attributes? Take food and drink, for example. These are things that, in becoming a part of a 
person or animal, disappear into, and seem to be absorbed by, that person or animal. This 
matches (to some extent) the fifth attribute of expressions. Furthermore, we spend our lives 
eating and drinking the same things repeatedly. This matches (to some extent) the third attribute 
of expressions. It is even the case that we experience one thing becoming part of multiple 
persons in sharing food and drink with others. This matches (to some extent) the fourth attribute 
of expressions. Many foods and drinks, furthermore, are intentional creations, and thus indicate 
for us the intentional acts of their creators. In experiencing them as indicating these intentions, 
we encounter them as related to the objects of those intentions; cake and champagne are “for,” or 
“represent,” celebration, while other foods (e.g., turkey or beer, in contemporary America) are 
“for,” or “represent,” family or community. This matches (to some extent) the first attribute of 
expressions. The only attribute which food and drink do not seem to match in any way is the 
second; we cannot make food present at will.

Our experience of air and breath is similar to that of food and drink. Breathing involves 
the repeated (similar to attribute three) taking in of air (similar to attribute five), and usually 
occurs at will (similar to attribute two), although the almost immediate exhalation of the air no 
doubt leads us to experience breathing as something less than the continual taking on of new, 
though basically identical, parts. However, we have the experience of breathing the same air as 
other people (similar to attribute four), and can even experience air’s being, to some extent, an 
intentional creation (similar to attribute one), when we experience the fresh air let in by a 
deliberately opened window, the cool air created by someone’s “turning down the thermostat,” 
or the warm air created by someone’s “turning up the thermostat.”  
Then we have things like creams, makeup,51 jewelry, and clothing (the last of which 
Husserl himself uses to describe our experience of expressions). We experience these as parts of 
ourselves to a certain extent. Creams disappear into us (similar to the fifth attribute of 
expressions), makeup does not, but is absorbed into the skin, and jewelry and clothing are not 
absorbed (except in the case of jewelry for piercings, perhaps), though the extent to which we 
become distressed when certain articles are lost or damaged shows just how much we experience 
them as parts of ourselves.52 We, furthermore, apply these things day after day, wearing the same 
clothing, jewelry, makeup, or cream over and over (similar to the third attribute of expressions). 
We find other people applying the same creams, makeup, jewelry, and clothing (similar to the 
fourth attribute of expressions), and as “trying to say something” about themselves in so doing 
(similar to the first attribute of expressions). However, we do not experience creams, makeup, 
and clothing as things we can make present at will. 
                                                           
51 Tattersall and Schwartz call “bodily decoration” like makeup “a hallmark of modern humankind” 
(“Evolution,” 81).

C. B. Macpherson (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1980), §26, 19. 

55 
 
And then there is the part-whole relationship between our lives and the experiences or 
events we constantly add to them. They become a part of our lives, even as they slip into the past 
and disappear (similar to attribute five of expressions). We have the cyclical or repetitive nature 
of the day, the week, the month, the season, and the year, with repeated events within the 
calendar like weekly religious meetings or liturgies, or yearly festivals, holidays, and birthdays.53 
In these, we are adding new parts to our lives that are the same as many other parts (similar to 
attribute three). And communal participation in events leads one and the same event to become a 
part of many different lives (similar to attribute four). Through memory, furthermore, we have a 
way of making these parts present again at will, in a certain way (similar to attribute two), and 
we experience many as being intentional creations, and thus as having an “object,” purpose, or 
“meaning” (similar to attribute one). 
Likewise, we experience facts (e.g., that the sun rises in the east, that the ball is in the 
corner, or that four is two more than two) as, in a sense, becoming part of our minds, though they 
“disappear” from present consciousness into long-term memory (similar to attribute five of 
expressions). Furthermore, we experience the same facts as becoming parts of an indefinite 
number of other minds (similar to attribute four), and perhaps in relearning things, or 
remembering things with difficulty, we even have the experience of a things becoming part of 
our minds over and over again (similar to attribute three). Likewise, in remembering or recalling 
things with ease, we have the experience of making a part of our minds present again at will 
(similar to attribute two). We even experience some facts as being intentional creations or 
choices, and thus as having an object or meaning in some sense (similar to attribute one).

d. Ground and Context for Expressive Experience 
It is, I would propose, the fact that our lives are suffused with experiences of the above 
types that allows us to experience expressions. In our early months and years, we become 
familiar with things that are intentional creations or are intentionally chosen, that seem in some 
instances to be presentable at will, that seem to be repeatable and to be able to belong to multiple 
wholes at once, and that seem to be parts that disappear into that of which they are parts. As we 
develop a greater and greater familiarity with such things, we become more and more able to 
experience and employ things as expressions, and with greater and greater ease. 
This does not mean, however, that we experience the various things listed above as 
expressions. We simply experience them as being similar to expression, and as our familiarity 
with them grows, we are laying the groundwork and context for our experience and use of 
expressions themselves. Without our experiences of the things described above functioning as a 
kind of background, it would be much more difficult, and perhaps impossible, for us to grasp 
“what is going on with” expressions. 
Appendix 2: Elaboration on the Many Types of Expressions 
There are many different types of expressions. Is it possible to understand them all as 
parts of their referents? Husserl’s primary examples, unfortunately, are only two: using a noun to 
name what an object is, and using a noun to name a property of some object (or to identify an 
object as being so propertied). He has not, in the passages we have read, given us a study of other 
types of expressions. However, he appears to think of nouns of other varieties as names (Hua 
XIX, 45–46/1:193, 54–55/1:198, 558–59/2:201, 691/2:292), and there is no reason that we 
cannot expand the Husserlian theory beyond Husserl’s explicit statements. 

57 
 
I see no problem, for example, with understanding proper names as naming people, verbs 
as naming activities, adverbs as naming ways of engaging in activities, and adjectives as naming 
ways of being a thing.54 Prepositions, likewise, may name relationships.55 After all, a statement’s 
categorial structure is filled by the structure of its object (Hua XIX, 671/2:280).56 But what of 
syncategorematicals like “the,” “if,” “whether,” and “every”? I suspect we would have to say 
that they are parts of expressions, rather than expressions themselves, just as letters are parts of 
words, but not words themselves (excluding cases like “a” and “I,” in English, or “y” and “o” in 
Spanish). 
All of these issues are complex, and would require a much longer essay to explore. 
However, the general principle I would propose is that we experience the various types of words 
employed in expressions either (a) as parts of their referents, and thus as being themselves 
fulfilled or frustrated (absorbed or rejected) by their referents, or (b) as affecting or influencing 
the fulfillment or frustration (absorption or rejection) of other words within the expression, and 
thus as being fulfilled or frustrated (absorbed or rejected) along with those other words. (Perhaps 
type (b) words are not complete expressions, but form complete expressions in conjunction with 
type (a) words.) 
What, then, of entire sentences? To be consistent, I believe we would have to say that we 
experience each part of a sentence that can itself be called an expression as being a part of 
whatever it refers to. In, “The cow is white,” we experience “The cow” as a part of the cow, and 
                                                           
54 “The noun, in its more elementary forms, names an individual, a group, or a class, while the verb either 
names an activity the subject is said to be engaged in, or it names a characteristic the subject is said to possess. . . . 
But perhaps we can dig deeper. . . . The verb can be considered as naming . . . the way the subject appears. The 
‘process’ of appearing can occur either in an action performed by the subject or . . . in the possession of an attribute” 
(Sokolowski, PA, 12). 
55 Cf. Sokolowski on prepositions having a sedimented spatial sense (PA, 123–24). 
56 “I say ‘is,’ and this word . . . names the predicational crease in the object under discussion” (Sokolowski, 
PA, 106). 

58 
 
“is white” as a part of the cow’s color (and hence as a part of the cow). (Alternatively, it may be 
we experience “is” as being a part of the cow alone.) In, “The blue book is on top of the grey 
book,” we would experience “The blue book” as a part of the blue book, and “the grey book” as 
a part of the grey book. But what of, “is on top of”? It seems to me (a) that I experience this part 
of the sentence as being part of both books at once, and (b) that this is made possible by the state 
of affairs of blue books’ actually being on the grey book. Given such examples—in which it 
seems we can account for each part of the sentence—I do not think we need to say that we also 
experience the whole sentence as itself a part of something. However, I am open to being 
convinced otherwise. 
Finally, what are we to say of expressions that refer to imaginary and ideal objects? Take, 
for example, “Frodo carried the Ring to Mt. Doom,” “The triangle has three sides,” or “Two is 
two less than four.” On the theory I am developing here, we must experience the expressions in 
such statements as parts of their referents. Otherwise, the sentences we take to refer to imaginary 
and ideal objects would not involve expressions at all, and hence such objects would be 
fundamentally ineffable. But can it make sense to say that we experience concrete, physical 
expressions as parts of imaginary or ideal objects? 
It seems to me there are at least four different ways of answering this question. First, we 
might say, “Whether or not it makes sense to rational, theoretic reflection, we do in fact 
experience expressions as parts of imaginary and ideal objects.” Second, we might say, “We 
obtain intuitive access to ideal objects through imagination” (see EU, 410–20/340–48) “and can 
also imagine expressions” (see Hua XIX, 42/1:191); “the experience of unity between 
expressions and imaginary or ideal referents, then, may somehow be achieved by imagination.” 
Third, we might say, “Expressions are ideal objects that have physical manifestations” (see, e.g., 

59 
 
Hua XIX, 48–49/1:195; Derrida, SP, 50); “when expressing physical things, we experience some 
physical manifestation of the sign as united with its referent, and when expressing ideal objects, 
we experience the ideal essence of the sign as united with its referent.” Fourth, we might say, 
“When we refer to ideal objects, what we are actually referring to is to a class of concrete 
objects, such that, ‘The triangle has three sides,” means, ‘All triangles have three sides.’ Thus, 
there is actually no problem with saying that we experience concrete expressions as parts of ideal 
objects; ideal objects are actually just a bunch of concrete objects” 
 To decide between these responses would require us not only to settle some thorny 
ontological issues, but to be able to study the fulfillments of the expressions in question. 
Unfortunately, describing how to bring imaginary and ideal objects to intuitive givenness is 
something into which we cannot go now.57 Thus, we must satisfy ourselves for the moment with 
a suite of possible solutions, rather than one definitive conclusion.
