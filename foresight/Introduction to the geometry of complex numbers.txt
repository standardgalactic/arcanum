PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION
The presentation of this book to English-speaking students permits
us to return to its reason for existence.
It is addressed to beginners, if we understand by this term all
those who, whatever might be their mathematical knowledge beyond
the usual studies, have not considered the use of complex numbers
for establishing geometric properties of plane figures.
We declare, in fact, that a student accustomed to the classical
methods of analytic geometry or of infinitesimal geometry is not,
ipso facto, prepared to solve problems, even be they elementary,
by appealing to complex numbers.
He is even very often much
embarrassed.
Now such obligations arise in the applied sciences, particularly
in electrical studies, where the graphical interpretation of the calcu-
lation is a convenient picture of the circumstances of the phenomenon
studied.
Finally, to assure the reader an easy and complete understanding,
we have not hesitated to develop things from the beginning, by
placing emphasis on the constructions connected with the algebraic
operations.
In deference to the practical end endorsed, we have only considered
constructions related to the concepts and methods of elementary
geometry.
One will find in other works (see, for example, the first
cited book by Coolidge) constructions which, following the ideas
of Klein, possess the character of invariance under the group of
circular transformations.
The French edition has undergone a complete revision in the
theory of unicursal bicircular quartics, in that of antigraphies, and
in the proof of the theorem of Schick (art. 128).
In addition, the statements of 136 exercises have been inserted
after the various sections.
They will allow the reader to test his
new knowledge and to interest himself at the same time with some
aspects of the geometry of the triangle; a theory is well understood
and will acquire power only after its successful application to the

PREFACE
solution of proposed problems.
At the start, some indications of
the path to follow, but not always suppressing personal effort, are
offered to assist the solver.
One can find in the Belgian journal
Mathesis, when such a reference is given, a complete solution by
means of complex numbers and often accompanied by developments
which enlarge the horizon of the problem.
The reader desirous of increasing his geometric knowledge in the
domain to which the present work serves as an introduction will
consult with profit, in addition to the books already cited, the re-
markable work Inversive Geometry (G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., London,
1933)
by Frank Morley and F. V.
Morley.
He will also find
in Advanced Plane Geometry (North-Holland Publishing Company,
Amsterdam, 1950), by C. Zwikker, a study of numerous curves
by means of complex coordinates.
It is pleasant to express our gratitude to Professor Howard Eves
of the University of Maine, who was so willing to take on the
burdensome task of the translation and whose judicious remarks
have improved the texture of several proofs, and our thanks to the
Frederick Ungar Publishing Company of New York for the attentive
care that it has brought to the presentation of this book.

FOREWORD
The present work briefly develops the lectures which we have
given since 1930 to the engineering candidates who chose the section
of electromechanics at the Faculte polytechnique de Mons.
A memoir by Steinmetz 1 emphasized the simplifying role that
can be played by the geometric interpretation of complex numbers
in the study of the characteristic diagrams of electrical machines.
This idea has proved fruitful in its developments, and many articles
published in such journals as the Archiv fur Elektrotechnik can be
comprehended only by the engineer acquainted with the meaning
and the results of a plane analytic geometry adapted to representations
in the Gauss plane.
One there encounters, for example, unicursal
bicircular quartics discussed by commencing with their parametric
equation in complex coordinates; the procedure consisting of returning
to classical geometry by the separation of the real and the imaginary
will more often than not be devoid of interest, for it hides the clarity
of certain interpretations which employ the relation between a com-
plex number and the equivalent vectors capable of representing this
number.
The study of such questions explains the appearance, particularly
in Switzerland and Germany, of works in which geometric expositions
accompany considerations on alternating currents.2
There does not exist a treatise of this sort in Belgium, and this
lack will perhaps justify the book which we are presenting to the
public.
Since, on the other hand, the geometrical results are independent
of the technical reasons which called them forth, the service rendered
to engineers will be little diminished if we stay
in the purely
mathematical domain.
We most certainly do not wish to affirm
by this that some technical illustrations of the theories which we

develop, presented by an informed specialist, would be lacking in
interest or timeliness; on the contrary, all our best wishes attend
the efforts of the engineer who would contribute to the papers of
Belgian scientific activity a work which certain foreign countries have
judged useful to undertake.
An engineer looking for a geometric solution to a problem born
in an electrotechnical laboratory will be able, in general, to limit
himself to the first two chapters.
It is interesting, however, to note
that H. PBieger-Haertell arrived at the determination of the affix
of the center of a circle, not by the method that we give for
finding the foci of a conic (article 60), but by utilizing a property
of Mobius transformations (article 127); and this shows that the
engineer is able to take advantage of these theories too.
The table of contents states the subject matter of each of the
articles, and therefore it appears unnecessary here to take up again
the detailed sequence of material treated.
To the friends of geometry, we hope they find in the reading
of these pages the pleasure that we have experienced in writing them.
No serious difficulty needs to be surmounted.
Variety is assured
by the appeals that we make to algebra, to the classical notions of
analytic geometry, to modern plane geometry, and to some results
furnished by kinematics, and the third chapter revives in a slightly
modified form the essentials of the projective geometry of real binary
forms, thus putting in relief all the pertinency of the title given
by Mobius to the first of his papers on the subject: 2
Ueber eine Methode, um von Relationen, welche der Longimetrie
angehOren, zu entsprechenden Siitzen der Planimetrie zugelangen (1852).
We would like to emphasize, moreover, the importance of those
circular transformations of which the particular case of inversion
is so often considered, but of which the direct involutoric case does
not seem to have received the same favor, which it so well deserves.
The obligation of limiting ourselves has not permitted us to treat
the antigraphy with the same amplification as the homography in
the complex plane.
Concerning these matters the reader will consult
with profit the Vorlesungen iiber projektive Geometrie (Berlin, 1934)
of C. Juel, the two books of J. L. Coolidge, A treatise on the circle

and the sphere (Oxford, 1916), The geometry of the complex domain
(Oxford, 1924), as well as the Lefons de geometrie projective complexe
(paris, 1931) of E. Cartan.
At a time when difficulties of all sorts create much anxiety for
the most cautious editors, the firm of A. De Boeck has not, however,
been afraid to undertake the publication of this work.
For its noble
courage, and for the attentive care that it has brought to the composi-
tion as well as to the presentation of this book, we express our thanks
and our gratitude.

CHAPTER ONE
GEOMETRIC REPRESENTATION
OF COMPLEX NUMBERS
I.
FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS
I. Complex coordinate.
Consider the complex number
x + iy
(x and y real)
which we denote by z.
Draw, in a plane, two perpendicular coor-
dinate axes Ox, Oy.
The point Z having for abscissa the real part x
of the number z and for ordinate the coefficient y of i is called the
representative point, or the image, of the number z.
Conversely,
each real point Zl of the plane is the image of a unique complex
number Zl equal to the abscissa of Zl increased by the product
with i of the ordinate of this point.
The number Zl is called the
complex coordinate, or the affix, of the point Zl'
A plane in which each real point is considered as the image of
a complex number is called the Gauss plane, the Cauchy plane, or
the plane of the complex variable.
We shall denote a point of the Gauss plane by an upper case letter,
and its affix by the corresponding lower case letter.
Corollaries.
10 The Ox axis is the locus of the images of the real
numbers.
The Oy axis is the locus of the images of the pure imaginary
numbers.
This is why Ox and Oy are sometimes called the real
axis and the imaginary axis of the Gauss plane.
20 The number -z is the affix of the symmetric of point Z with
respect to the origin O.
2. Conjugate coordinates.
The complex number conjugate to
z=x+iy
will be designated by the notation
z = x-iy
15

FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS
which is read, " z bar," and which will never appear as the written
representation of a vector.
A vector will always be indicated by
the juxtaposition of the two upper case letters representing its origin
and its extremity, surmounted by a bar, as AB.
The image Z of the number zis the point symmetric to Z with respect
to the Ox axis.
3. Exponential form.
In the Gauss plane, we choose for the
positive sense of rotation and of angles the sense of the smallest
rotation about 0 which carries the Ox axis into the Oy axis.
The
algebraic value (xy) of any angle having Ox for initial side and
Oy for terminal side is, then, to within an integral multiple of 27T,
7T
(xy) = +"2'
(1)
FIG. 1

Let Z be the image of a non-zero complex number
z = x + iy.

One

recognizes in eand r polar

coordinates of Z for the
x-
x pole 0 and the axis Ox.
From
the
theorem
on
orthogonal projections we
have
a
x=rcosB
and, because of equation (1),
y = rsin B.
Equation (2) can then be written as
z = r (cos e+ i sin e)
or
z = reiB , I
(3)
the exponential form of z.

6. ADDITION
When z
=
0, we are to take r zero and 8 arbitrary.
We have
17
4. Case where r is positive.
When the positive sense of the
a axis is that from 0 toward Z, the number r is positive and is the
modulus of z; 8 is then an argument of z.
We write
r = I z I = I x + iy I = + vix2+y2,
the radical signifying that we extract the arithmetic square root of
x2 + y2.
If, on the contrary, the a axis is such that r is negative, then
equation (3) can be written as
Z = (-r) (-I) eiB
or, since -
1 =
ein, as
z = (- r) ei ("+61.
The modulus and an argument of z are then -
rand
7T + 8.
5. Vector and complex number.
The image Z of the number z
is determined if we know the vector OZ, the vectorial coordinate
of Z for the pole O. We can then say that the number z is represented
by this vector.
The number and the vector have equal moduli,
and we can conveniently speak of an argument of the number as
an argument of the vector.
Nevertheless, we will never convey these facts by writing
OZ = z
as is done by some authors, for such a use of the = sign easily leads
to contradictions when employed in connection with the product
of two vectors (see article 10) in the sense of classical vector analysis.
6. Addition.
If the n complex numbers
(k = 1, 2,... , 11)
have for images the n points Z k> their sum
z = Zl + Z2 + ... + Zn
has for image the point Z defined by the geometric equation
OZ =
OZI + OZ2 + ... + OZ".

Let x, y be the coordinates of

1Â° Any vector Z'i
of the Gauss plane represents the

complex number equal to the complex coordinate of the extremity of
the vector diminished by the complex coordinate of the origin of the vector.
Equation (6) gives, in effect,
so that the vector Z2Z1 represents, like OZ, the difference ZI -
Z2'

8. MULTIPLICATION
19
2Â° Any equality between two geometric polynomials whose terms are
vectors of the Gauss plane is equivalent to an equality between two
algebraic polynomials whose terms are the complex numbers represented
by these vectors, and conversely.
Thus, using the notation suggested in article I, an equation such as
AB = CD +EF
is equivalent to the algebraic equation
b -
a = d -
c +f -
e.
8. Multiplication.
If the complex numbers Zl. Zz are represented
by the vectors OZt, OZ2' the product
x
z,
FIG. 4
Therefore
is represented by the vector OZ which one obtains from OZt, for example,
asfollows: 10 rotate OZt about 0 through an angle equal to the argument
of the other vector OZz; 20 multiply the vector thus obtained by the
modulus of vector OZ20
If r1, rz and 8t , 82 are the moduli and the arguments of ZI. zz,
we have, by (3) of article 3,
!I
The
argument
of
z
is
then
81 + 8z, while its modulus is
r1 r2 = I OZI
0 OZz I
which justifies the indicated con-
struction.
We can realize the same end by taking on Ox the point U having
abscissa + 1.
The sought point Z is the third vertex of triangle

Particular cases.
10 The number Zz is real.
Its argument is
o or 7T according as it is positive or negative.

20
We have
FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS
OZ = Z20Z1
and the point Z is on the line OZI'
2Â° The number Z2 is complex with unit modulus.
It then has the
form
Z2 = ei8"
82oF kn,
k an integer.
The point Z is at Zi and is obtained from Zl by a rotation of
angle 82 about O.
3Â° The number Z2 is i or -
i.
Since
to multiply a complex number Zl by Â± i is to rotate its representative
vector OZI about 0 thr(lugh an angle of Â± n12.
9. Division.
If the complex numbers Zl> Z2 are represented by
-
-
the vectnrs OZl> OZ2' the quotient
Z =
Zl
Z2
is represented by the vector OZ which one obtains from the vector OZI
as follows: 1Â° rotate OZI about 0
through an angle equal to the
negative of the argument of vector OZ2; 2Â° divide the vector thus
y
(lbtained by the modulus of vector OZ2'
Using the notation of article 8,
the construction of Z follows from
The point Z is the third vertex of

triangle OZ2U,

Construction of the point Z given by Z = l/z2'

with respect to Ox and we have

Consequently, the point Z is

plex numbers to the geometric concept, or the reverse, is the aim
of the present notes.

FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATIONS

FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATIONS
13. Transformation.
Any process associating with each point Z
of the Gauss plane at least one point Z' of this plane constitutes
a transformation of the plane into itself, and may be designated
by a letter, say w.
We shall consider only transformations in which
1Â° to each point Z there corresponds a single point Z' ;
2Â° each point Z' is the correspondent of a single point Z.
Such a transformation w is said to be one-to-one,. the point Z'
is the correspondent, or the homologue, of Z.
The process which, starting with Z', yields the point Z, is called
the inverse transformation of wand is denoted by w-1 .
The equation of a transformation w is the relation between the
affix z of an arbitrary point Z of the plane and the affix z' of the
point Z' corresponding to Z.
OZ' = OZ + OA,
the equation of the translation
IS
(7, corollary 20)
ZZ' = OA
is called the homologue of Z m
the translation of vector OA.
Since we have

14. Translation.
Let A be a fixed point and Z an arbitrary
point of the plane and let a and z be their affixes.
The point Z' such that
Iz' = z+aÂ·1
When a is real but not zero, the translation is parallel to Ox.
If a
= 0, the translation reduces to the identity transformation with
equation
z' = z
which transforms each point of the plane into itself.

15. Rotation.
Let A be a fixed point of affix a, and let a be a
given real number, positive, zero, or negative. In a rotation about A
of an angle with algebraic value
'!I
a, each point Z of the
plane
takes a position Z'.
The vectors AZ', AZ repre-
sent the complex numbers
(7, corollary 1Â°), and since AZ'
is obtained from AZ by the in-
dicated rotation,
we have (8,
particular case 20)
z' -
a =
(z -
a) eiaâ€¢
The equation of the rotation of angle a in algebraic value, about
the point of affix a, is then
z' = zeia + a (1 -
eia).
Corollary.
The symmetry with respect to the point A is nothing
but a rotation of angle a
=
71" (or -
71") about A and, since
em = cos 71" + i sin 71 = -
1,
its equation is
z' = -z +2a.
16. Homothety.
Let us be given a fixed point A of affix a
and a real non-zero number k, positive or negative.
If we arbitrarily
place an axis on the line joining A to any point Z whatever of the
plane, the point Z' of this axis such that we have the algebraic relation
AZ'
AZ
=
k
is the homologue of Z in the homo-
thety (A, k) of center A and coefficient,
or ratio, k.t
Since
FIG. 9

AZ' = k AZ,
we also have (7)
z' -a = k (z-a)

Complements de geometrie plane, article 116
(A. De Boeck,
Brussels, Belgium, 1955).

FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATIONS
and the equation of the homothety is
z' = kz + a (1 -
k).
Remark.
The values I, -
I for k give the identity transformation
(14) and the symmetry with respect to point A (15).

FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATIONS
In order to introduce the expression (7) for p, and at the same time
to eliminate (xd), which depends on the point Z considered, let
us substitute for equation (8) the result obtained by replacing each
number in the equation by its conjugate, that is to say, by
z- m= NIZ e-i(xdl.

If we multiply equation (9) by equation (10), member by member,
and take note of (7), we get, for the equation of the inversion (M, p)

20. Point at infinity in the Gauss plane.
The projective
plane (which can be studied in analytic geometry with the aid of
homogeneous coordinates) contains an infinitude of points at infinity
constituting a range of points lying on the line at infinity in this plane.
The Gauss plane (which is studied with the aid of the complex
coordinate z) contains, on the contrary, only a single point at infinity,
that which corresponds to z infinite.
By virtue of the equation (19)

Z =--::-,

in an inversion, the point at infinity in the Gauss plane is the inverse
of the center of inversion.

The transformation

Furthermore, from an equation such as (13) we can

right or on the left, by the same transformation

from the definition of a product of transformations.

30 The product of a transformation wand its inverse w-1 is the
identity transformation, and is represented by 1.
Thus we have
w-1w = 1, and ww-l = 1.
22. Permutable transformations.
Two
transformations
WI>
W 2 are said to be permutable if the correspondent of each point Z
in the transformation W2Wl coincides with the correspondent of Z in
the transformation WlW2'
We write
W 2W 1 = W 1W2'
Examples.
1Â° Any two translations whatever are permutable.
The equation of the product W l W 2 of the translations considered
in the first example of article 21 being
z' =
Z + a2 + aI'
proves, if we compare with equation (16), that Z'
=
Z2, which
is what we wished to establish.
2Â° Two rotations are permutable only if they have the same center.
The equation of the product
WlW2 of the rotations
considered
in the second example of article 21 being
z' = zei(at,+at,) + a2 (1 -
ei at,) ei at, + a1 (1- ei at,),
proves, if we compare with equation (17), that the points Z', Z2
coincide only if we have
a1(l -

ei at,) = a2 (1 -
ei at,) ei at, + a1 (1 -

Since <Xl'
a2 are supposed not to be integral multiples of 27T, the
exponentials eia1, eia. are different from 1, whence al
=
a2 and
the centers A l , A2 of the rotations coincide.
23. Involutoric transformation.
A transformation w is said
to be involutoric if the correspondent of an arbitrary point Z being Z',
the correspondent of Z' is Z.
The product of the transformation wand the transformation w
is then the identity transformation, and we have
ww = 1
or
W Z = 1.
(18)
We therefore say that a transformation is involutoric if its square
is the identity transformation.
If we multiply the two members of the symbolic equation (18)
by w-l , we have (21)
Consequently, a transformation is involutoric if it is identical with
its inverse.
A symmetry with respect to a point, a symmetry with respect
to a line, and an inversion are involutoric transformations.

the A.R. of four points of the Gauss plane.
IÂ° An A.R. of four points does not alter in value if we exchange
two points and at the same time the other two points,. it takes the reciprocal
value if we exchange the first two points or the last two points,. it takes
the value complementary to unity if we exchange the two mean points
or the two extreme points.

Corollary.
Each real or imaginary number Z is the anharmonic
ratio determined by the point Z, the point U on the Ox-axis having
abscissa 1, the origin 0, and the point at infinity, for
(ZUOoo) = (zlOoo) = z.
28. Real anharmonic ratio.
In order that the A.R. of f(lur
points Zl' Z2' Z3' Z4 of the complex plane be real, it is necessary and
sufficient that these points belong to a common line or to a common
circle.
This A.R. is then the same as that considered in elementary
geometry.
With the notation of article 25 we have
(1)
and for this A.R. to be real it is necessary and sufficient that for
some integer n we have
(a 2S alS) -
(a24 a14) = mr.
(2)
Case I -
where thepoints Zl, Z2, Z3 are collinear.
For some integer
n1 we have
and consequently
(a24 au) = (nl -

which proves that point Z4 is on the line ZlZ2'

ANHARMONIC RATIO
Choose the axes ala, au, a2a, a24 SO that they form a single axis.
Equation (1) then becomes
and is the same as the definition given in elementary geometry for
the A.R. of four collinear points.
Case 2 -
where the points Zl' Z2' Za are not collinear.
The points
lie on the circle y which they determine.
Orient ala, a2a, au from
Za toward Zl, from Za toward Z2' and from Z4 toward Zl; then
choose the positive sense of a24 so that in equation (2), which holds
by hypothesis, the integer n is even.
The equation then becomes
and
proves
that
the
point Z4 is on the circle

Points Za, Z4 mayor

39
But, by projecting the second A.R. from point M, we conclude
that it is equal to the A.R. defined in modern plane geometry for
the four points Zl' Z2' Zs, Z4 of the circle y.
Conversely, if the points Zl> Z2' Zs, Z4 are collinear or concyclic,
we have equation (2), and equation (1) proves that the A.R. (ZlZ2ZSZ4)
is real.
29. Construction.
Being given three points Zl' Z2' Zs, as well
as a real or imaginary number of modulus r and argument 0, there
exists a unique point Z 4 such that
(ZlZ2ZSZ4) =
reiO
(3)
and we shall construct it.
From the equation
(ZlZ2ZSZ4) =
we obtain
Zl -
Z4 = reiO
Z2 -Z4
Z4 [(z2-zS)reiO -
(zczs)] =
Zl(z2-zS)reiO -

In this equation, which is linear in Z4' we cannot have at the same time
(Z2-ZS)reiO -
(Zl-ZS) = 0,
Zl(z2-zS)reiO -
Z2(ZCZS) = 0,

(Z2-ZS)(Zl-ZS)(Z2-Z1) = 0,
Zl(Z2-ZS)

which is impossible since the points Zl' Z2' Zs are supposed to be
distinct.

If (5) does hold, that is, if
Zl -

Z2- Za
or (9)
Z4 is infinite and the point at infinity of the Gauss plane is the only
point Z4 which fulfills the requirement.
To construct Z4 when (5) does not hold, we do not employ the
expression (6) for Z4' but we write equation (3) in the form (25)

this circle has for diameter the segment PQ of the line ZlZ2' where

In the
case where r 1 = I, that is to say, if r = I ZlZa/Z2Za I, circle y is replaced
by the perpendicular bisector of the segment Z1Z2.
Equation (8) says that Z4 is on the arc u described on Z2Z1 and
for which Z2Z1 subtends an angle of algebraic value
8 =

whose sign specifies on which side of the line Z1Z2 in the oriented
plane we should draw u.
In the case where 81 is an integral multiple
of 17, the line Z1Z2 replaces u.
Point Z4 is the intersection of y and u.
It will be noticed that
Z4 is at infinity if r1 = I, 81 = 0 ; it is the midpoint of the segment
Z1Z2 if r 1 = I, 81 =
17, and in the two cases, y and u are lines.
30. Harmonic quadrangle.
When the A.R. of four points Zl>
Z2' Za, Z4 of the complex plane is equal to -
I, it is said to be
harmonic.
The four points are necessarily on a line or on a circle (28).
In
either case, if
(9)
we say that Zl> Z2 are harmonic conjugates with respect to Za, Z4
or harmonically separate Za, Z4' and also, since (ZaZ4Z1Z2) =

(26), that Za, Z4 harmonically separate Z1' Z2.
The figure formed
by the four points is called a harmonic quadrangle, and is degenerate
if the points are collinear.

Apollonius of triangle ZlZ2ZS associated with vertex Z3' and its
center Os is the midpoint of segment XY inasmuch as angle XZsY
is a right angle.
Since (ZtZ2XY) =
-
1, the circle of Apollonius 0 3 is orthogonal
to circle Â° and the line Z3Z4 is the polar of point 0 3 with respect
to circleÂ°and thus contains the pole P3of the line ZlZ2'

If we observe that (II, corollary)

equation (14) takes the form (12).
The equality of the moduli of the two members of (12) yields
equation (13).
If we place the origin of cartesian coordinates at M a and the
x-axis on ZlZ2, equation (12) becomes
z~ = ZaZ4'
Since
z~ is a positive real number, its argument is zero, which is
then also the sum of the arguments of Za, Z4' and the proof is complete.
Conversely, if we have equation (12), then point Ma is the midpoint
of the segment joining Zl to its harmonic conjugate Z2 with respect
to points Za, Z4'
In fact, (12) can be written as
ma (2z1 -
Za -
Z4) =
z~ -
ZaZ4
which is linear in ma.
The value of ma is that of the affix z of the
midpoint of ZlZ2 if (ZlZ2ZaZ4) =

31. Construction problems.

harmonically separate Za, Z4 and such that Ma shall be the midpmnt
of the segment ZlZ2'

If Za, Z4' Ma are not collinear (Fig. 21), the sought points are
(30, III) the intersections of the interior bisector b of angle (MaZa,
M aZ4) with the circle y which passes through Za, Z4 and whose
center 0 is on the perpendicular to b at Ma.

31. CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS
The construction is still applicable if Z3' Z4' M3 are
with
M3 between
Z3
and
Z4 (Fig. 22).
It does not succeed if M 3 is on an extension
of the segment Z3Z4' for then b coincides
with the line Z3Z4; in this case b contains
Zl'
Z2'
and
these points are determined
by
the
equation
M3Z~
=
M3Z3.M3Z4
(Fig. 23).

The form of equation (15) shows that Z is the harmonic conjugate
of the point A, of affix a, with respect to the points B, C, of affixes
b, c (30, II), and can be constructed by the procedure indicated
above (30, I).
Equation (16) written in the form
_2_=_1_+_1_

shows that Z is the harmonic conjugate of the origin 0 with respect
to the points A, B of affixes a, b.

If A, B, C are the points of affixes a, b, c, point Z is the midpoint
of the segment which joins A to its harmonic conjugate with respect
to B, C (30, III).
32. Equianharmonic quadrangle.
When four points constitute
a harmonic quadrangle (30), the principal A.R.'s are -
1, 1/2, 2,
and the 24 possible A.R.'s separate themselves into three sets of
eight ratios having these values, for these have -
1, 2, 1/2 for their
reciprocals.
We are going to show that there exist in the Gauss plane quadruples
of points for which the 24 A.R.'s lead to only two values, instead
of the 6 of the general case and the 3 in the case of a harmonic
quadruple.
If four points are such that tW(l principal A.R.'s are equal, they
are equal to a third and have for value either
ei :rt/3 or e- i:rt/3â€¢
We
say that the anharmonic ratio is equianharmonic and that the four
points form an equianharmonic quadrangle; 12 of their A.R.'s
have the value ei"/3, the other 12 have the value e-i:rt/3â€¢
The principal A.R.'s of any four points have the values (26)

Properties.
10 Given any three points Zl' Zz' Z3 in the Gauss
plane, there exist two points W, W' which form with the given points
two equianharmonic quadrangles.
The points W, W', called the isodynamic centers of triangle
ZlZZZ3, are common to the three circles of Apollonius of the triangle.
In an equianharmonic quadrangle, the three pairs of opposite sides
have equal products, and conversely.
We know (29) that there exists a unique point W such that
(ZlZZZ3W) = ein/s
and a unique point W' such that
(ZlZ2Z3W') =
e-in/3
and we are able to construct these points by noticing, for W for
example, that

ZZZ3 . ZzW

(Z3ZZ' Z3Z1) -

But we can determine the pair W, W' by considering only the moduli,
if we write
for from this we obtain
I ZlW I
I ZlZ3!
I ZIW I
I ZIZz!
I Z3W !

ZzW

Z3W

and similar equalities for W', whence W, W' are common to the
three circles of Apollonius.
The preceding equations give
I ZIW.ZZZ3 1=
I ZZW,Z3ZI I = ! Z3W.ZIZzl
and conversely.
20 In order that a triangle ZlZZZ3 be equilateral, it is necessary
and sufficient that one of the isodynamic centers be the point at infinity
in the Gauss plane,. the other isodynamic center is the point of con-
currency of the medians of the triangle.

EXERCISES 17 TO 31
49
(21)
The condition is necessary.
In fact, if ZlZ2Za is equilateral, we
have
I ZlZa I = I ZzZa I,
and consequently (25, 27)
(ZlZzZaoo) =
eÂ±i3r/S,
(22)
from which it follows that the point at infinity is an isodynamic
center.
Since the circles of Apollonius reduce to the perpendicular
bisectors of the sides, the second isodynamic center is the point
mentioned.
The condition is sufficient, for equation (22) carries with it equations
(21), and these express that the triangle is equilateral.
30 If the points Zl' Z2' Za are collinear, and if we construct Z',
Z', Z' such that
z
a
(ZzZaZlZ;) = -
I,
(ZaZlZzZ;) = -
I,
(ZlZzZaZ;) = -
I,
then the isodynamic centers of the triple Zl' Z2' Za are the points W,
W' common to the three circles having for diameters the segments ZlZ~,
Z2Z;, ZaZ~.
These circles are, in fact, for the degenerate triangle ZlZ2Za, the
circles of Apollonius associated with the vertices Zl' Z2' Za.

CHAPTER TWO
ELEMENTS OF ANALYTIC GEOMETRY
IN COMPLEX NUMBERS
I.
GENERALITIES
33. Passage to complex coordinates.
Let x and y be the car-
tesian coordinates and z the complex coordinate, relative to two
perpendicular axes Ox and Oy, of a real point Z.
We have (1)
x+iy=z
and consequently
x -
iy = z.
From these two equations we obtain the formulas
x = ; (z + z),
y =
~i (z -
z)
permitting us to pass from the rectangular cartesian coordinates to the
complex coordinate.
The polar coordinates 0 and r of Z, relative to the pole a and the
polar axis Ox, are related to x and y by the equations (3)
x = r cos 0,
from which we obtain
y =
r sin 0
z-z
o=
arc tan . (
_) .
lZ+Z
r2 = x2 + y2 = (x + iy) (x -
iy) = zz,
y
z -
z
tan 0 = x =
i (z + z)"
We therefore pass from the polar coordinates to the complex coordinate
by the formulas
r = (zz)!,
55

56
THE STRAIGHT LINE
34. Parametric equation of a curve.
If, relative to two per-
pendicular axes Ox, Oy, a curve c has parametric equations
x = fI(t),
Y = fe(t),
(1)
fl(t), f2(t) being real functions of a real parameter t, the complex
parametric equation of c is
Z = x + iy = fl(t) + ife(t)
or
z = f(t),
(2)
f(t) being a complex function of the real parameter t.
Conversely, we pass from (2) to (1) by separating the imaginary and
the real parts.
Direction components of the tangent to c at the point with para-
meter t being
~~ = f~(t), z=
f~(t),
the complex number
dx + idy
dt
dt
or
dz
dt
we have
is the affix of a point which, joined to 0, gives a line parallel to the
considered tangent.
Therefore:
If z =
f(t) is the complex parametric equation of a curve c, the tangent
at the point with parameter t is parallel to the line joining the origin
to the point of affix dzJdt.
II.
THE STRAIGHT LINE
35. Point range formula.
If Zl' Z2' Z are the affixes of two points
Zl' Z2 and of the point Z which divides the segment ZlZ2 in the ratio
k =
ZIZ
ZZe '
Zl + kZ2
(I)
Z=
l+k.
By analytic geometry, we know that if (Xl' Yl), (x2, Y2), (X, y)
are the rectangular cartesian coordinates of Zl' Z2' Z, then
Xl + kXe
YI + kYe
X=
l+k
' Y=
l+k
.

36. PARAMETRIC EQUATION
57
Since
Z = x +iy,
we obtain equation (1).
This result also follows from the classic
vector equation
OZ =
OZI + kOZ2
1+ k
.
Corollary.
By taking k = 1, we again find (30, II) the affix
Z = ! (ZI + Z2)
of the midpoint of the segment ZIZ2.
36. Parametric equation.
If a line passes thrQugh the point A
of affix a and is parallel to the line joining the origin to the point B
of affix b, its parametric equation is
I z = a + bt, I
(2)
:r:
FIG. 24
o
OZ = OA+AZ
or, since
AZ =
t OB
with the real number t varying with
the point Z,
where t denotes a real parameter which can vary from -
00 to + 00.
If Z is any point whatever of the
y
line, we have
OZ = OA+t OB.
From this vector parametric equation of the line we obtain (7)
equation (2). This result also follows (34) from the analytic parametric
equations
x = al + bIt,
y = a2 + b2t
of the line, where (aI' a2), (b I , b2) are the cartesian coordinates of
the points A, B.
Corollaries.
1Â° Every real line contains the point at infinity of
the Gauss plane.
Equation (2) shows, in fact, that for t infinite we
have z infinite.

58
THE STRAIGHT LINE
2Â° It is easy to calibrate the line of equation (2), that is to say,
to construct the points Z which correspond to diverse real values
of t.
Since the points A, ZI of affixes a, a + b are given by the
values 0, I of t, the calibration is accomplished by considering AZ1
as a positive unit segment.
3Â° The parametric equation of the line joining the points ZI' Z2
of affixes z l' Z2 is
since the vector Z2Z1 having the direction of the line represents the
number Z 1 -
Z2.
4Â° To express that the points ZI' Z2' Zs are collinear, it suffices
to state that, t being a real number, we have
Z3 -
Zl = t(Zl -
Z2)Â·
This equation is equivalent to
ZIZa =
t Z2Z1.
This way of expressing the collinearity of three points is generally
preferred to that pointed out in article 37.
37. Non-parametric equation.
The general equation of a real
line of the Gauss plane is of the form
(3)
in which b is a real number.
This line contains the point of affix -
b/2a
and is perpendicular to the vector represented by the number a.
In fact, the general equation of a real line in rectangular cartesian
coordinates is
!XX + f3y + y = 0,
the numbers ex, fl, y being real.
The real points Z of this line then
have for affixes z the solutions of the equation (33)
ex (z + z) + ~ (z -
z) + 2y = Â°
t
or
ex(Z + z)-ij3(z-z) + 2y =
0,

37. NON-PARAMETRIC EQUATION

2')1 = b,
ex + if3 = ii,
which, if one sets
ex-if3 = a,
takes the form (3).
Equation (3) admits the solution -
bl2a inasmuch as b being real
we have b = b.
The parallel line drawn through the origin has
for equation
az + iiz = 0,
and contains the point of affix ia and is thus perpendicular to the
vector joining the origin to the point of affix ii.

The line with equation (3) contains the points Zl' Zz if we have

(6)
By claiming that the linear homogeneous equations (3), (5), (6) in
a, ii, b are satisfied by values of a, ii, b which are not all zero, we
obtain equation (4).

In fact, equation (8) is equivalent to

from which we obtain (9).
The numbers PBC/ABC, PCA/ABC, PAB/ABC are the absolute
barycentric coordinates of P for triangle ABC.
The relation (9) thus
expresses the affix of a point as a function of the absoluteÂ· barycentric
coordinates of this point for any triangle and of the affixes of the vertices
of the triangle.

THE CIRCLE

40. Non-parametric equation.
The general equation of a real
or ideal circle of the Gauss plane is of the form
I zz + az + liz + b = 0
(2)
or
in which b is a real number.
The affix of the center is - a and the square of the radius is aa -
b.
In rectangular cartesian coordinates, every real or ideal circle has
an equation of the form
x2+y2 + 20cx + 28y + 'Y = 0,
the numbers a, [:3, 'Y being real.
The coordinates of the center are
-
a, -
[:3 and the square of the radius is a 2 + [:32 -
'Y.
According
as this square is or is not positive, the circle is real or ideal.
In complex coordinates, the equation of the circle is then (33)
zz + a(z + z) -
i[:3(z -
z) +'Y = 0
zz + (ex -i[:3)z + (ex + i[:3)z + 'Y = Â°
which, if we set
ex -
i[:3 = a,
ex + i[:3 = ii,
'Y = b,
takes the form (1).

64
THE CIRCLE
From equations (2) we find that the affix of the center and the
square of the radius are
-rx-ifJ = -a,
rx2 +fJ2 _y = (rx +ifJ) (rx-ifJ)-y = aa-b.
Example.
If A, B, C are three given points in the Gauss plane,
let us determine the locus of points Z such that
ZA.ZB + ZB.ZC + ZC.ZA = O.
If a, b, c, z are the affixes of A, B, C, Z, we must have (10)
~-~~-~+~-~~-~+~-~lf-~+~-~~-~
+ (c-z) (a-z) + (c-z) (a -z) = 0
or, by expanding,
6 zz -
2 (a + b + c) z -
2 (a + b + c) z + (a + b + c) (a + b+ c)
-
(aa + bE + cf) = O.
The locus is thus a circle.
If we place the origin at the centroid G
of the system of points A, B, C, we have (38)
a + b + c = a + b+ l = 0,
aa = GA2 = 1. (2 AB2 + 2 AC2 -
BC2)
9
and the equation of the circle becomes
zz =
~ (GA2 + GB2 + GC2) = l~ (AB2 + BC2 + CA2).
The center is G and the square of the radius is the value of ZZ.l
41. Parametric equation.

z=--
ct + d
in which a, b, e, d are real or imaginary constants such that
ad-bc::J::O
and t is a parameter able to take on all real values, represents

2Â° a circle in all other cases.

When c = 0, we have ad =FÂ°by virtue of (4), and equation (3),

This represents a straight line.

Zl =

as well as relation (4).

The four points Z, Zl' Zo, Zoo are therefore on a straight line
or on a circle (28).
The curve, which is determined by the fixed
points Zl' Zo, Zoo, is the locus of all the points Z furnished by the
set of real values of t considered in (3).
The curve is a straight line
if there exists a real value of t which makes z infinite, that is to say,
if the root -
dlc of
et+d=O
is real, for a straight line is distinguished from a circle by the fact
that it contains the point at infinity of the Gauss plane.
Conversely, any straight line and any real circle can be represented
by an equation of the form (3).

66
THE CIRCLE
In fact, if Z, P, Q, R are an arbitrary point and three fixed points,
of affixes z, p, q, r, on a straight line or circle, we have (28), t denoting
a real number varying with Z,
(zpqr) = t
or, after the development of
z-q . z-r _ t
p-q' p-r -
,
r(p-q) t-q(p-r)
z =
(p _ q) t _ (p _ r)
.
In this equation, which has the form (3), we have
a=r(p-q),
b=q(r-p), c=p-q, d=r-p,
ad-bc = (p-q) (r-p) (r-q)
and this product is not zero since P, Q, R are distinct.
42. Construction and calibration.
To construct a circle given
by an equation of the form (3), it suffices to construct three points
of the circle.
It is particularly interesting to construct the points
Zl' Zo, Zoo corresponding to the values 1,0,
ClO of t and whose affixes
are
t(ez-a) = b-dz,
But if these points are close to one another, it is expedient to use
other values of t.
Or we can calculate, as follows, the affix w of the
center and the magnitude R of the radius.
It suffices to find the
non-parametric equation of the circle by eliminating t from equation
(3) and its conjugate
which gives

Being given three non-collinear points A, B, C and
a real number e, let us determine the points Z such that if we rotate
the points B, C about Z through angles of algebraic values 2e and e
respectively, the resulting points B', C' shall be collinear with point A.
Consider the figure in the oriented Gauss plane and related to
two perpendicular axes Ox,

The point Z is then (31, 40) the midpoint of the segment which
joins C to its harmonic conjugate C I with respect to points A and B.
Since triangle CAB is isosceles, the symmedian CC I is a diameter
of the circumscribed circle, and point Z is the center of the circum-
scribed circle of the triangle.
We easily recognize the fact that the
rotations 2B and Babout Z carry B, C into B' = A = C'.
We are led more directly to the indicated construction by the
following often employed device: we choose the origin of the Ox
and Oy axes in such a fashion as to simplify the affix of the point
to be constructed (see the example of article 40).

When the properties of a figure to be studied depend

scribed about triangle ABC and to place the center 0 of this circle at the origin of the
rectangular axes Ox, Oy of the Gauss plane.
Circle (0) is then referred to as the

separate the real and the imaginary parts, then eliminate t from the
two parametric equations so obtained.
But the calculation is simpler if we observe that a suitable rotation
of the Ox and Oy axes about 0 converts equation (I) into an equation
of the same form in which the complex numbers a, b are replaced by
their moduli.
In fact, let a, f3 be the arguments of a, b. Since
a = I a I ei<x,
b = I b I eiP,
equation (1) can be written as

As t varies, the lines bearing the vectors OAt, OBt generate two
pencils which, being inversely equal, have in common two per-
pendicular rays Ox!> Oy!> the interior and exterior bisectors of every
---
----
angle (OAt> OBt).
When OAt> OBt are on Ox1, they have the
same sense, while their senses are opposite when they are on 0Yl'
In each case, the tangent to (E) at the point Z which these vectors
determine is perpendicular to AtB t (see 1Â°), that is, to the diameter
OZ, and the latter is thus an axis of the ellipse.
3Â° If the lines OAt> OBt meet the normal ZN to (E) in
A~,
B~,
the foci of the ellipse are the intersections F, F' of the OX1 axis with
the circle passing through
A~,
B~ and having its center at the point
of intersection T' of the Oy1 axis and the tangent ZT.
The affixes of these foci are the two square roots of the product 4ab.
We have, by 2Â°,
OP = OF'2 = [lOA I+ IOB IF -
[i OA I- IOB 1]2 = 4 IOA.OB I
= lOA; 1. lOB; IÂ·
Since, moreover, OX1 IS the interior bisector of angle (OAt, OB t),
we have (30, III)
whence (31, 1) the indicated construction for F and F' and, if f
is the affix of F,
j2 = a;b; = 2at . 2bt = 4ab.
We also note that if T and N are the points of OX1 on the tangent
and the normal at Z, then (TNFF') = -
1, OF = -
OF', from
which we get another construction of F and F'.
4Â° The semi-diameter OZ' conjugate to OZ is perpendicular to AtB t
and has IAtB t I for length.
The diameter conjugate to OZ is parallel to the tangent ZT, and
therefore perpendicular to AtB t.
Since the tangent is parallel to
the vector represented by the number (see 1Â°)
i(aeiUJt _ briUJt) = ein/2.aeiUJt + e-in/2.briUJt = aeiUJ(Hn/2UJ) + be-iUJ(t+n/2UJ)
and since Z' must be furnished by a value t' of t giving
Z' = aeiUJt' + be-iUJt',
we conclude that Z' is obtained for

and that
I OZ' I = I aeiwt' + be-iwt' I = I aeiwt -
be-iwt I = I AtBt I.
5Â° The center of curvature C of the ellipse for the point Z is the
harmonic conjugate, with respect to the points A;, B;, of the orthogonal
projection P of the center of the ellipse on the normal.
At the instant t, the magnitude v of the velocity of the point Z
describing the ellipse is (10)
v = I ~; I = IwAtBt I
while the acceleration vector is represented by the complex number
~:: = _w2 (aeiwt + be-iwt) = -w2z.
This vector is therefore w 2ZO.
Consequently, the algebraic value
of the normal acceleration, on the arbitrarily oriented normal ZN,
is ZP.w 2â€¢
But we know that ZP.w2 has the value
ZC
whence we have
ZB? = ZP.ZC,
which establishes the property.
The point C can be constructed by notlcmg that OP and OC
cut off on ZB t a segment of which B t is the midpoint.
Corollary.
The radius vector OZ sweeps over an area which in-
creases proportionally to the time t.
We have just seen that under the motion of equation (1), the
acceleration w 2ZO always passes through the fixed point 0, and the
planar motion takes place under the action of a central force.
48. Theorem.
Every ellipse can be generated with the aid of two
determined rotating vectors.
Consider (see Fig. 32) an ellipse (E) with foci F, F', and whose
minor axis lies on 0Yl'
If the tangent to (E) at a point Z cuts 0Yl
in T', let A't>
B~ be the points where the normal at Z is cut by the
circle having center T' and passing through F, F'.
The vectors
OA;/2,
OB~/2 are the sought vectors OAt> OBt, which must rotate
with angular velocities that are equal and opposite, but of arbitrary
magnitude inasmuch as the lengths of the axes of the generated
ellipse are independent of w.

Theorem I.
An ellipse is
in two ways the locus of a point Z which describes a circle with a constant
angular velocity, while the circle rotates around a fixed point 0 with
a constant angular velocity equal to minus half the first angular velocity.
It suffices to interpret equation (1) of the ellipse (E) written in
one of the forms
z =
aeiwt + beiwt.e-2iwt,
z = ae-iwt.e2iwt + be-iwt.
(5)

Consider equation (5). Let A,
B be the points with affixes a,
b; the fourth vertex Zo of the
parallelogram
constructed
on
OA and OB is the position of
the moving point at the instant
t = O.
By rotation about 0 with
constant angular velocity w, the
points A, Zo, and the circle (co)
of center A and radius I AZo I
occupy at instant t the positions
At> Z', (Ct).
The affix of At is
aiwt, and vector AtZ' is ob-
tained from AZo by the rotation
represented

the
number

biwt.
If, then, we rotate AtZ' about At through the angle -
2wt,
we have the vector AtZ representing the number biwt.e-2iwt, and
the point Z can then be obtained as stated in the theorem.
Equation (6) gives Z by considering a point which describes the
circle of center B and radius I OA I with angular velocity 2w, while
this circle rotates about 0 with velocity -
w.
Theorem II.
An ellipse is in two ways the hypocycloidal locus
of a fixed point Z im'ariably connected with a circle which, without

82
THE ELLIPSE
slipping, rolls interiorly on a circle of radius twice that of the first circle.
At instant t, the motion of point Z on the ellipse (E) is tangent
to the motion which results (theorem 1) from the rotation of angular
velocity -
2w about At and the rotation of angular velocity w about
O. These rotations compound into a single rotation about the in-
stantaneous center of rotation C a located on line OAt and such that

The locus of C a in the fixed plane, that is, in the plane of the base
curve, is thus the circle f3a of center 0 and radius I OCa I = 2 I OAt I
= 2 lOAI, while the locus of C a in the moving plane, that is, in the plane
of the generating curve, is the circle Pa of center At and radius I AtCa I
= I OAt I = I OA I.
The ellipse (E) is then the locus of a point Z

a point Z rotating uniformly about a point while that point rotates
uniformly about a fixed point O.
It suffices to interpret equation (I) written in one of the forms

as Wll

For an epicycloid, the base circle and the generating circle are exteriorly

rolls on the smaller.
In fact, if WIW Z > 0 and, as in figure 36, I WI I < I W z I, equations
(4) show that CI is between 0 and AI> whence the circles PI' f31
touch exteriorly, while C z is on the prolongation of AzO and the
circles Pz, f3z are tangent interiorly, the radius of the first being
then greater than that of the second.
For a hypocycloid, the base circle and the generating circle are tangent
interiorly, and it is the smaller circle which rolls on the larger.

52. EPICYCLOIDS, HYPOCYCLOIDS

In fact, if W1W2 < 0 and, as in figure 37, I WI I > I W2 I, equations (5)
show that CI is on the prolongation of OA1, whence the circles PI'

The same
reasoning applies to P2' [:12'
For a hypocycloid, the diameter of one generating circle is less than
the radius of the corresponding base circle, while the diameter of the
other generating circle is greater than the radius of the corresponding
base circle.

A cycloidal curve (epicycloid or hypocycloid) is said to be ordinary
if it is generated by a point of one of the generating circles.
This point
belongs to two generating circles, the two base circles coincide, the moduli
of the rotating vectors are inversely proportional to those of their angular
velocities, and the radii of the generating circles are proportional to
the moduli of the angular 'velocities of the vectors which cause their
centers to rotate.
In fact, if Z is on the generating circle PI of radius (51, II)
I OAI W I!W 2 I, we have
IAIZ I = I OA2 I = IOAI :: I,
then
I A2Z I = I OAI I = I OA2 :: I

Moreover
I OAI I = Iw21

whence the concentric base circles [:1 1> [:12 have (51, II) the same

An epicycloid is lengthened or shortened according as the point Z

UNICURSAL CURVES
53. Definitions.
A plane curve is said to be unicursal if it can
be represented in cartesian coordinates by parametric equations
(1)
in which fl(t), f2(t) are rational functions of the real parameter t,
that is, are polynomials or ratios of two polynomials in t.
Its complex parametric equation
then has the form
ao+ aIt + a2t2 +
+ amtm
A(t)
(2)
Z =
bo+ bIt + b2t2 +
+ bntn
B(t)'
the coefficients a, b of the polynomials. A(t), B(t) of arbitrary degrees
m, n being real or imaginary constants.
1 In an article where these developments are found (Ueber neue kinematische
Madelle, sowie eine neue Einfuhrung in die Theorie der cyclischen Curven, Zeitschrift
Math. Phys. XLIV, 1899, translated in the Enseignement mathematique, vol. 2, 1900,
pp. 31-48), F. SCHILLING has given the construction of simple apparatuses based on
these properties which permit all the cycloidal curves to be described mechanically.

54. ORDER OF THE CURVE
89
Thus the straight line and the circle with respective equations
(36, 41)
are unicursal curves.
54. Order of the curve.
If we eliminate t from equations (1),
by Sylvester's method, for example, we obtain the cartesian equation
of the curve in the form
P(x, y) = 0,
where P(x, y) is a polynomial of some degree s in the variables x and y.
The curve is thus algebraic, and we know that an arbitrary straight
line cuts it in s points, real or imaginary, distinct or not.
We say
that the curve is of order s.
Theorem.
The unicursal curve with equation (2) in which
1Â° the polynomials A(t), B(t) are relatively prime, and
2Â° B(t) vanishes for v real or conjugate imaginary values (distinct
or not), is of order
m + n -
v
if
m > n,
2 n-v
if
m <: n.
Let us first of all obtain from (2) the cartesian parametric equations.
We must give to the fraction a denominator having real coefficients.
Since the total number of real roots and of conjugate imaginary
roots of the equation B(t) = 0 is v, we can write
B(t) = B.(t).Bn_.(t),
where B.(t) is a polynomial of degree v whose coefficients are all
real, while, if v < n, B,,_.(t) is a polynomial of degree n -
v whose
coefficients are not all real.
The equation
Bn_.(t) = 0
has no real roots nor any pairs of conjugate imaginary roots. By
grouping together the real and the pure imaginary parts we have
Bn-.(t) =
B/(t) + iB"(t),
which we will write as
Bn-. = B' + iB";
at least one of the polynomials B/, B" has degree n -
v.
Note
that B/, B" are relatively prime, for if they should have a common

90
UNICURSAL CURVES
root, real or imaginary, Bn-. would have a real root or two conjugate
imaginary roots.
We similarly write
A(t) = A'(t) + iA"(t)
or
A = A' + iA";
at least one of the polynomials A', A" has degree m.
We then have
A' + iA"
Z =
B.(B' + iB")Â·
(3)
Multiplication of the numerator and denominator of the fraction
by B' -
iB" gives the sought form
A'B' + A"B" + i(A"B' -
A'B")
Z =
B.(B'2 + B"2)
(4)
and consequently the cartesian parametric equations of the curve
A'B' + A"B"
x =
B.(B'2 + B"2) ,
A"B' -
A'B"
Y =
B.(B'2 + B"2) .
(5)
The real or imaginary points of the curve located on the arbitrary
real or imaginary line with equation
(6)
(8)
correspond to the real or imaginary values of t which are roots of
the equation
A"B' -
A'B" = p(A'B' + A"B") + qB.(B'2 + B"2)
obtained by replacing x and y in (6) by their values (5).
This
equation can be written as
qB.(B'2 + B"2) + [A'(pB' + B") + A"(pB" -
B')] = 0.
(7)
The degrees in t of the first and second terms are 2n -
v and
m + n -
v, respectively.
The announced theorem will then be established if we show that
no root of (7) gives the form %
to one, and consequently to the
other, of the expressions (5).
If a root to of (7) renders x and y indeterminate, we will have
A'B' + A"B" = 0,
A"B' -
A'B" = 0,
B.(B' + iB") (B' -
iB") = 0,
a system equivalent to equation (8) along with
A'B' + A"B" + i(A"B' -
A'B") = Â°or (A' + iA") (B' -
iB") = 0, (9)
A'B' + A"B" -
i(A"B' -
A'B") = Â°or (A' -
iA") (B' + iB") = 0. (to)

54. ORDER OF THE CURVE
91
By virtue of (9), to annuls A' + iA" or B' -
iB".
Since the polyno-
mials A, B are relatively prime, if to annuls A' + iA", this value
also annuls, because of (10) and (8), A' -
iA" and B' -
iB" ; thus
to annuls each of the polynomials A', A" and is imaginary inasmuch
as B' and B" are relatively prime; the number conjugate to to therefore
annuls A', A", B' + iB", and consequently the polynomials A, Bn-.,
which is impossible.
If, on the other hand, the value to annuls
B' -
iB", it is imaginary and does not annul B' + iB", for B' and
B" are relatively prime.
Hence, by virtue of (10), to must annul
A' -
iA" ; the conjugate of to will then annul B' + iB" and A' + iA",
which is impossible.
x
FlG.38
Remarks.
IÂ° An imaginary root of (7) gives, with the aid of
(5), an imaginary point of the curve and, by (4), a z whose image
is not this point since each z has a real point for image (I).
2Â° It may be that a unicursal y
curve consists of a curve of lower
order but counted several times.
Thus, according to the theo-
rem, the equation
z =
ao+ a1t2
represents a curve of the second
order, or a conic.
But if we set
t2 = T,
T > 0
the equation becomes
z = ao+ alT
and represents (36) a ray radiating from the point Ao of affix ao,
each point Z of which is given by two values of t, namely the two
square roots of the number T which yields this point.
As t varies
from -
00 to + 00, the ray is thus described twice, namely in the
two opposite senses, by the point Z.
Also notice the case where B(t) is the conjugate of A(t).
Since
I z I = 1, Z lies on a circle.
3Â° The only non-irreducible fractions to which the theorem can be
applied are obtained by multiplying the polynomials A(t), B(t) by the
conjugates of an arbitrary number of linear factors into which the
polynomial Bn-.{t) resolves itself.

92
UNICURSAL CURVES
and we will have
In fact, if we multiply A(t) and B(t) by a common factor t -
0:,
the analogues of m, n, v are
mi = m + 1,
ni = n + 1,
VI
if
VI =
V + 2.
The only way of increasing by 2 the number of real or conjugate
imaginary roots of B(t)
=
0 by multiplying by the single factor
t -
0: is to choose for ex the conjugate of some one of the roots of
Bn_.(t) = O.
It follows that the fraction (4) is the only fraction whose denominator
polynomial has all its coefficients real and to which the theorem for
the determination of the order of the curve can be appli~d.
55. Point construction of the curve. l
If we carry out the
indicated division, equation (2) becomes
R(t)
z =
Q(t) + B(t)'
Q(t) being a polynomial
Co + CIt + c2t2 + ... + cm_ntm-n
(11)
of degree m -
n, and the fraction can be replaced by a sum of simple
fractions in which a p-fold root ex, real or imaginary, of B(t)
=
0
gives rise to the partial sum
k=P-I

k (t _

(12)
k=O
where the lk's are constants,
The point Z corresponding to a value of t can then be found
by obtaining the sum of the vectors representing the terms of (11)
and those of the sums analogous to (12).
For these latter it will
be noted that

56. CIRCULAR UNICURSAL CURVES
93
56. Circular unicursal curves.
A plane algebraic curve re-
presented by a cartesian equation with real coefficients and which
passes k times through one of the circular points at infinity also
passes k times through the other circular point at infinity.
The
curve is said to be k-circular,. it is called circular, bicircular, or tri-
circular according as k is 1, 2, or 3, that is, according as each of the
circular points is a simple, double, or triple point of the curve.
A curve can be k-circular without being unicursal, and conversely.
but it can also possess both of these characteristics.
Theorem.
The unicursal curve with equatinn (54)
A(t)
A(t)
A
(13)
z = B(t) = Bv(t) . Bn-v(t)
Bv(B' + iB")
is (n -
v)-circular.
The coordinates of an arbitrary point of the curve are given by (5).
Since the circular points are at infinity, the values (imaginary) of t
able to give a point of the curve which is to be a circular point must
annul the denominator of the fractions (5) and thus figure among
the roots of
Bv(B' + iB") (B' -
iB") =
O.
(14)
must be roots of
Moreover, the t's corresponding to the
the isotropic line of equation
x + iy = 0
circular point situated on
(15)
A'B' + A"B" + i(A"B' -
NB") = 0,
an equation which can be written as
(N + iN') (B' -
iB") = 0
or
A(B' -
iB") = O.
(16)
The t's furnishing the considered circular point are therefore the
roots common to equations (14), (16), or, since A and Bv(B' + iB")
are two relatively prime polynomials, are the roots of
B'-iB" = o.
(17)
This equation being of degree n -
v, the theorem is established.
57. Foci.
A real or imaginary point is a focus of a given plane
curve if the two isotropic lines radiating from this point are tangents
to the curve.
When the curve is k-circular, a focus is singular if the isotropic
lines radiating from this point have their points of contact at the

94
UNICURSAL CURVES
circular points.
For example, the center of a circle is the only focus
of this circular curve, and it is singular.
Theorem.
If the unicursal curve with equation (56)
A
Z = B.(B' + iB")
does not have a multiple point in the finite part of the plane on the
isotropic lines radiating from the origin, then the origin is
I0 an ordinary focus if the equation A =
0 has a root which is
at least double and which is not a root of
B' -iB" = 0;
20 a singular focus if the equations in t
A = 0,
B' -
iB" = 0
have at least one common root.
(17)
The t's of the points common to the curve and to the isotropic
line of equation (15) are the roots of (16) ; the n -
v common circular
points (coincident at the same circular point) correspond to the roots
of (17) (56).
Among the remaining common points, suppose that
there are no two which coincide
because of the existence on the
isotropic line of a multiple point in the finite part of the plane.
Then, in order that the origin be an ordinary focus, that is, in order
that the isotropic line be tangent to the curve at a non-circular
point, it is necessary and sufficient that two roots of the equation
A = 0 be equal but be distinct from any root of B' -
iB" = O.
If, on the contrary, the origin is to be a singular focus, the point
of tangency must lie at the circular point, and at least one of the
points given by A = 0 must coincide with the circular point.
Determination of foci.
A translation of axes to a sought focus
of affix ep gives the curve the new equation
A
A -
4>Bv(B' + iB")
Al
, = Bv(B' + iB") -
4> =
Bv(B' + iB")
= Bv(B' + iB")'
The ep of an ordinary focus annuls the discriminant of Al and the
double root then existing for Al = 0 must not annul B' -
iB".
The ep of a singular focus annuls Al and B' -
iB".
For the 4> of
an ordinary focus, it is necessary to see if the isotropic line contains
or does not contain a multiple point in the finite part of the plane.

UNICURSAL BICIRCULAR QUARTICS AND
UNICURSAL CIRCULAR CUBICS
We first of all make the following remarks about the trinomials
A == ao+ 2alt + a2t2,
B == bo+ 2blt + b2t2
in the real parameter t and whose coefficients are real or imaginary.
1Â° A and B have no common zero and are therefore relatively prime
if and only if their eliminant
dab = 4(aobl -
albo) (alb2 -
a2bl)-
(aOb2 -
a2bo)2
is not zero.
If we set
mo = alb2 -

we have
2Â° The zeros of B are real or conjugate imaginary if and only if

for it is necessary and sufficient that bo, bl , b2â€¢ and consequently
also their conjugates, be proportional to (the same) three real numbers.
3Â° For only one zero of B to be real, it is necessary and sufficient
that equations (1) do not hold and that the equations
B == bo+ 2blt + b2t2 = 0
B == bo+ 2blt + b2t2 = 0
be compatible, and therefore that we have
d bb = 4(bobl -
blbo) (blb2 -
b2bl)-
(bob2 -
b2bo)2 = o.
These conditions are necessary, for if we have (1) the two zeros
of B will be real or conjugate imaginary, and if a real number is
a root of an algebraic equation, it is also a root of the conjugate equa-
tion.
The conditions are sufficient, for if bo = 0 or b2 = 0 we have
the real zero 0 or 00, and if bob2 -::f:. 0, the common zero is that of
b2B -
b2B == 2(blb2 -
b2bl) t + bolJ2 -
b2bo,
which is real.

65. GENERAL EQUATION
107
4Â° From the preceding it follows that for tlte zeros of B to be non-
conjugate imaginary, it is necessary and sufficient that we have
d bb -::1= 0,
for this inequality will not allow the equalities (1).
65. General equation.
If tlte trinomials A, B are
relatively
prime, the equation
(2)

A

B
represents 1
1Â° a unicursal bicircular quartic if the zeros of B are non-conjugate
imaginary, that is, if d bb -::1= 0 ;
2Â° a unicursal circular cubic if only one of these zeros is imaginary.
We refer to the notation of article 54.
10 Since the zeros of B are non-conjugate imaginary numbers,
we have n = 2 and v = O.
Therefore
n-v=2
(3)
and the curve is bicircular (56).
Also, smce m
~ n, we see that
the curve is of order (54)
2n-v =
4.
Hence the curve is a unicursal bicircular quartic.
2Â° Since B contains only one imaginary zero, it is clear that v = 0
or 1 according as the other zero of B is infinite or a finite real number.
If v = 0, then n = 1 and
n-v=1
and the curve is circular (56).
We cannot have m = 1, for then
A and B would each have infinity for a zero.
Therefore m
=
2
and m > n, whence the curve is of order (54)
m + n-v =

Hence the curve is a unicursal circular cubic with an equation of

Hence the curve IS a unicursal circular cubic with an equation of

Z = [bo (yT + 0) + 2 bl(txT + j3)] [ro(yT + 0) + 2 rl(txT + fI))

We can satisfy (7) by

Theorem I.
The origin is a double point
for the cubic or the quartic with equation (2) if the numbers ao, aI' a2
are proportional to real numbers.

66. DOUBLE POINT
109
FIG. 41
If from (2) we obtain the cartesian coordinates x, y of a variable
point o(the curve as functions of t (54), then, for the origin to be
a double point, it is necessary and sufficient that all lines through
the origin intersect the curve in points of which two coincide with
the origin, and hence that x and y vanish simultaneously for values
of t which are real and distinct, real and equal, finite or infinite,
or conjugate imaginary.
Therefore it is necessary and sufficient that
z vanish under the same conditions, that is, that the roots of
A => ao + 2al t + a2t2 = 0
be real, finite or infinite, or be conjugate imaginary, whence the
theorem.
Corollary+ If ao, a1, a2 are real, then, according as
is negative, zero, or positive, the two branches of the curve which pass
through the double point D
have real and distinct tangents,
real and coincident tangents,
or conjugate imaginary tan-
gents, and D is called a cru-
node, a cusp or spinode, or an
acnode or isolated point.
Theorem II.
If equation (2) represents a quartic C 4, and if the
numbers mo, m 1, m 2 are not proportional to real numbers, then C4
has a single proper double point D with affix

a real or imaginary number k such that
bod + kro =

bId + kri = aI'
b2d + kr2 = a2Â·
(13)
Since D..bb ::f=- 0, we do not have the equalities (1), the numbers bo,

['II bo

They are not all zero since (14) is of rank 2; consequently fJ
::f=- 0.
Since mo, ml, m2are not all zero, we find from the first two of equations
(13), if m 2 ::f=- 0, for example, the affix (9) of the unique double point.

and consequently also, even if t1> t2 are conjugate imaginary,
2fli2-

Since the sought equation is of the form
t2-
(t} + t2) t + t1t2 =
0,
the elimination of t 1 + t2 and t1t2 from these last three equations

If we replace d in (12) by its value (9), equation (12) becomes

,
whence, by the corollary of theorem I, we have the assertion concern-
ing the sign of expression (11), for the numbers like m1ifi2 -
m2ifi}
are pure imaginaries.
Corollary.
If the double point D
IS a CUsp, its affix d is a root
of the equation
(bob2-
b~)d2 -
(aOb2-
2a}b} + a2bo)d + aOa2 -
a~ = Â°
(18)
obtained by setting the discriminant of the trinomial in t in the
numerator of (12) equal to zero.
In fact, the vanishing of (11) implies, by virtue of (17), the vanishing
of rOr 2 -
ri, which, because of (13), implies the vanishing of
(ao-
bod) (a2-
b2d) -
(a} -
b}d)2.
Theorem III.
If equation (2) represents a quartic C4, and if the
numbers m o, m}, m 2 are proportional to real numbers Po, P1> P2' the
quartic degenerates into a circle r counted twice, and which has, according
as m 2, mo, or m l is different from zero, the equation
t 2, to, t l being real parameters.

UNICURSAL BICIRCULAR QUARTICSâ€¢â€¢â€¢
we get
Because
~ab *- 0, at least one of the numbers mo, ml, m2 is not
zero.
Since
equations (15), (16) are equivalent and we can, if m2, for example,
is not zero, choose arbitrary real numbers ro, r l and find r2 by (15).
We are going to show that, for ro' rl not both zero, the first two
of equations (13) are solvable for d and k, that is, that we have
bOrl -
bIrO *-Â°or, what amounts to the same thing, bobl *- 0.
Because ~bb *- 0, we have bo*- 0.
Otherwise, from the equations
alba -
a2bl = fJ-Po,
a2bo-
aOb2 = fJ-PI'
aObl -
albo = fJ-Pa,
boPo + blPI + baPa = 0,
(19)
and consequently, if boshould be zero, bo, bl, b2 would be proportional
to real numbers and ~bb would be zero.
Solving the first two of equations (13), we have
d =
aOrl -
alrO_.
bOrl -
bIrO
Therefore C4 has for double points all the points of the locus with
equation
z -
~ota -
a.l
(20)
-
bota-
hIÂ·
By virtue of (19), bl/bo is not real, since otherwise b2/bo would also
be real and we would have ~bb = 0.
Consequently (41), the locus
of double points is a circle and not a straight line.

Theorem IV.
When the quartic C4 degenerates into a double circle r,
the point Z with affix (2) runs over the whole circle or over only an
arc of the circle according as the number
P~ -
4 PoP2 is negative or
positive.

Suppose m 2 -::j::. O.
The right members of equations (2) and (20)

For a given real t 2' the two values of t are real if

Since
~ab = 4mOm2-

we also have

If P; -
4POP2 < 0, relation (22) holds for all real values of t2 because
P: > 0, while if P; -
4POP2 > 0, we must take t2 ~ t' or t2 ~ t",
where we have designated the zeros of P2t2 + plt + Po by t', t"
(t' < t").

Corollary.
The two values
T 1,
T 2 of t which furnish a common
point of r are related by
2moT 1T 2 -
m1(Tl + T 2) + 2m2 = o.
In fact, (21) yields the two relations
2m2t2
-
m2
T 1 + T2 =

TIT2 =

m1t2 + mo
m1t2 + mo
from which it suffices to eliminate t 2â€¢
Theorem V.
If equation (2) represents a cubic, then this cubic
does not degenerate and it enjoys the properties stated in theorem II.
By hypothesis we have
~ab = 4mOm2 -
m~ -::j::. 0,
~b5 = 4(bob1 -
b1bo) (b1b2 -
b2b1) -
(bob2 -
b2bo)2 = 0,
but the matrix
(23)
is of rank 2.
It suffices to show that mo, m1, m2 cannot be proportional to real
numbers Po, Pl, P2' because it is on this fact that rests, in theorem II,
the existence of the unique proper double point.

We employ reductio ad absurdum.
If we should have

we would have
boPo + blPl + b'lfJ2 = 0,

hoPo + hlPl + h'lfJ2 = 0,
relations which, because of (23), give
Po = v(b1h2-
b2hl),
PI = v(b2ho-
boh2),
P2 = v(bohl -
b1ho)Â·
We would then have
d ab =,.,,2(4poP2-pi) =,."Vdbb =0,
which is contrary to hypothesis.

value of t.
In the calibration of (d) and (c), point 0 1 corresponds to 0 on
(d) and to 00 on (c).

68. Inverse of a conic.
The transform of a non-circular conic
(C) by an inversion of center 0 is a unicursal circular cubic or a unicursal
bicircular quartic (CI ) with double point 0
according as 0 is or is
not on (C).
Choose axes with origin at O.
The equation of any conic (C) is (58)
Co + 2cIt + c2t
2
(26)
Z =
ro+ 2rIt + r2t2 '
where ro' r I , r 2 are real.
Since in the inversion with center 0 and
power p, the point with affix z has the point with affix plz for inverse
(19), the inverse curve (C I ) of (C) has for equation
z -

only one real zero r, which is then also a zero of Co -+ 2ctt -+ c2t2â€¢
In the two cases (C) passes through 0 for t = co and t = r respectively.

10 The double point is an acnode, a cusp, or a crunode
according as the conic (C) is an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola
(66, corollary of theorem I).

116
UNICURSAL BICIRCULAR QUARTICSâ€¢â€¢â€¢
The tangents to (C1) at Â° are parallel to the asymptotic directions
of (C).
In fact, the inverse of a point at infinity on (C) is at 0.
2Â° The preceding statements are particular cases of general properties
of inversion, which we are going to recall.
An inversion with center Â° is a quadratic involutoric point trans-
formation whose fundamental (or 'singular) points are Â° and the
circular points I, J. 1
The transform of an algebraic curve (C)
of order 1 which passes to> li' 1; times, respectively, through 0, I,
J, is a curve (C1) of order 21- 10 -li -
1; which passes 1- li -1;,
1-
1; -
10 , 1 -
10
-
li times, respectively, through 0, I, J.
The
tangents to (C1) at 0, I, J contain the points of intersection, other
than 0, I, J, of (C) with, respectively, the lines IJ, JO, 01; two
tangents at Â° to (C 1) coincide if (C) is tangent to IJ.
Therefore, if (C) is a non-circular conic, we have 1 = 2, li =
1; = 0,
and (C1) is a cubic or a quartic according as 10 has the value I or O.
We deduce from the preceding that a necessary and sufficient condition
for the circular points I, J to be cusps of the quartic (C1) is that the
center Â° be a focus of the conic (C), for it is necessary and sufficient
that the conic be tangent to the isotropic lines 01, OJ.
3Â° The converse of article 65 is true: every unicursal circular cubic
and every unicursal bicircular quartic can be represented by an equation
of the form (2).
We know that a cubic and a quartic are unicursal when they
have, respectively, one and three double points.
If the curves are
circular, the quartic being bicircular, the unique double point of
the cubic and the third double point of the quartic are necessarily
in the finite part of the plane.
An inversion having this double
pointÂ°for center transforms the cubic or the quartic into a conic (C),
for in the case of the cubic we have (see 20)
I = 3,
10 = 2,
Ii = I,
I; = I,
21 -
10 -
Ii -
I; = 2,
and for the quartic we have
I = 4,
10 = 2,
Ii = 2,
I; = 2,
21 -
10 -
Ii -
I; = 2.
Since the equation of the conic (C) can always be put in the form
(26) (58), the equation of the considered cubic or that of the con-
sidered quartic can always be given the form (27), therefore also
the form (2).

117
69. Lima~on of Pascal and cardioid.
A
lima~on of Pascal
is a unicursal bicircular quartic whose circular double points are cusps.
It is called a cardioid when the third double point D is also a cusp.
In an inversion with center D, the
lima~on then transforms (68,
corollary 20) into a conic with focus D.
According as D is an acnode,
a crunode, or a cusp, the conic is an ellipse, a hyperbola, or a parabola.
The quartic with equation
is a limafon if
Z=
ao+ 2aIt + a2t2
bo+ 2bIt + b2t2
~b =
bob2-b~ = 0,
that is, if the den(lminator is a perfect square.
If we take the origin of axes at the double point D of affix d, the
equation becomes

bod + 2(al -
bId) t + (a2-
b2d) t2
Z
-
-"---"----'------;--'---'----=-;-'----'-----,--:~-"---"--'---

bo+ 2bIt + b2t2

and we know (66, theorem I) that ao -
bod, al
-
bId, a2
-
b2d
are proportional to real numbers.
The conic obtained from the quartic by the inversion with center D
and power p has for equation
p
bo + 2bIt + b2t2
Z2 = ZI = P ao-
boa + 2(al -
b;J)-t-+=----:(:-a2-Â·b2J) t2 â€¢
In order that D be a focus, it is necessary and sufficient that we
have (60, corollary)
bob2-
b; = 0
or
bob2-
b; = O.
Corollary.
The quartic is a cardioid if (66, theorem II)
bob2-bi = 0,
(mOffzl -
mIffzo) (mIffz2-
m2ffzl ) -
(mOffz2-
m2ffzo)2 = O.
70. Class of cubics and quartics considered.
The number m
of tangents which can be drawn from a point to a given plane algebraic
curve is independent of the point and is called the class of the curve.
Plucker has shown that we have the relation
m =
n(n -1) -
2d -
3r
connecting the order n, the class m, the number d of non-cuspidal
double points, and the number r of cuspidal double points of the curve.

118
UNICURSAL BICIRCULAR QUARTICSâ€¢â€¢â€¢
Consequently, a unicursal circular cubic is of class 4 or 3 according
as it is not or is cuspidal.
A unicursal bicircular quartic is of class 6 if none of its double points
is a cusp, of class 5 if the proper double point is the only cusp, of class 4
or 3 according as the quartic is a limafon which is not or is a cardioid.
Remark.
In the evaluation of the number m of tangents drawn
from a point P of the curve, it is necessary to note that if P is simple,
the tangent at this point counts for 2 in the number m; if P is double,
the tangents at this point count for 4 or 3 according as P is not or
IS a cusp.
71. Foci. Theorem.
A unicursal circular cubic possesses a singular
real focus and, according as it is or is not cuspidal, one or two ordinary
real foci.
A unicursal bicircular quartic which is not of the limafon type possesses
two singular real foci and, according as it is or is not cuspidal, one
or two ordinary real foci.
A limafon has a singular real focus and
an ordinary real focus,. a cardioid has a singular real focus and no
ordinary focus.
These properties follow from the definition of a focus (57) and
from the class (70) of the curve.
Thus, a non-cuspidal quartic
has two tangents
t 1,
t z at the circular point I and the conjugate
lines
t~, t; as tangents at the second circular point I', whence the
points
tlt~, t 2t; are the two singular real foci.
Moreover,
since
the class is 6, we can draw two tangents t3 , t4 from I whose points
of contact are not I, and the imaginary conjugate lines t;,
t~ of
t 3, t4 are the tangents drawn from I'; the points t3t;,
t4t~ are then
the ordinary real foci.
Singular foci.
If we take the origin of axes at the point F
of affix e/>, equation (2) becomes
~ _
ao -
boe/> + 2(al -
b1e/Â» t + (~2 --=_t2e/Â»
~2
(28)
-
bo+ 2b1t + b2t2
Point F is a singular focus if the numerator and the conjugate of
the denominator have a common zero (57), and therefore if their
eliminant is zero, or
4(bob2-
b;) [(aD -

(az-

71. FOCI
If we set, by analogy with what has been done for conics,
119
H ab = aobz -
2a1b1 + azbo'
Haii and H ba having the obvious analogous meanings, the equation
becomes
or
(4~b~b-H~b)c/>z-2(2Hab~b-HabHbb)c/>+4~a~b-H~b =
O.
(30)
For a cubic, the denominator in equation (2) has a real zero
which is then a zero of the conjugate trinomial, and the eliminant
4~b~b -
Hgii is zero.
Equation (30) is of the first degree and the
affix of the only singular focus of the cubic is
4~a~b -
HZab
2(2 Hab~b -
HabH bb)"
A quartic which is neither a limayon nor a cardioid has two singular
foci (see theorem) ; their affixes are the two roots of (30).
For the limas;on and the cardioid we have
~b
= 0 (69), hence
also
~ii = 0, and equation (29) gives the affix
H ab
H bb
of the only singular focus.
Ordinary foci.
Their affixes are to be found among the values
of c/> which annul the discriminant of the numerator of (28) (57).
We must therefore have
or
(31 )
This is the same equation as that for conics, except that the b's
are imaginary (60).
We notice first of all that if the non-circular double point D is
a cusp, its affix d is a root of equation (31), for this equation is none
other than equation (18).
Consequently, if the curve is not cuspidal at D or at the circular
points, the roots of (31) are the affixes of the two ordinary foci.

directly similar to triangle aDZt gives a point Z of the curve (8)
which corresponds to the same value of t as does Zt.
We can also construct the curve, as an epicycloidal curve, with the
aid of two rotating vectors.
In fact, the addition and subtraction of w in the form (34) to and
from the right member of (33) gives, if we set
rxoflt - rxtflo
a=

Po + tPt

The coefficient of a has unit modulus and we can set

,
whence
z =
w 2 + 2aweiT + a2e2iT
and if we place the axes at the point of affix w 2 the equation becomes
, = 2aweiT + a2e2iTâ€¢
The vectors representing the numbers 2aw, a2 and rotating with
angular speeds in the ratio I : 2 furnish the construction of the
curve (50).
Relation (35) between t and T can, if we set
be written as
rosin (80 + ;)
t = - ----:-------'--
r l sin (81 + ;)
2Â° Other quartics.
If a 2 is not zero in equation (2), then, by
carrying out the division of the two trinomials and by placing the
origin at the point with affix a 2/b 2, the equation takes the form
,
=
a~ + 2a{t
bo+ 2b1t + b2t2"
Designating the non-conjugate imaginary zeros of the denominator
by p and q, we can write the preceding equation in the form
I
m
,= t-p + t-q'

122
UNICURSAL BICIRCULAR QUARTICS...
where land m are constants.
Since the equations
l
m
~I =
t _ p'
~2 =
t _ q
represent two circles passing through the origin (t = 00), the quartic
can be constructed pointwise by forming the sum of the vectors issuing
from the origin and terminating at the points (If the circles which
correspond to the same value of t (also see article 64).
3Â° Double point.
If the double point does not have nne of the
numbers ao/bo, ai/bI' a 2/b 2, relative to equation (2), as affix, then it
belongs to the three straight lines or circles with equations
(36)
This follows from equations (13), from which we find, if we denote
the quotient of the real numbers rl' r2 by t,
The double point D with affix d is then on the straight line or the
circle represented by the first of equations (36).
We interpret the
other two equations in a similar way.

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE HOMOGRAPHY
73. Definition.
Let z, z' be the affixes of two points Z, Z'
of the plane referred to two perpendicular axes Ox, Oy, and let
ex, fl, y, 8 be given constants, real or imaginary.
Consider the equation
exzz' + flz + yz' + 8 = Â°
(I)
which is bilinear in z and z.'
By writing the equation in the form
z(exz' + fl) + yz' + 8 = 0,
we see that if, having arbitrarily chosen z', we wish the equation
to give one and only one value for z (00 not excluded), it is necessary
and sufficient that the equations
cx.z' + fl =
0,
yz' + 8 = Â°
be incompatible, or that
cx8 -fly* o.
(2)
We then conclude, by writing the equation in the form
z'(cxz + y) + flz + 8 = 0,
that to each value of z there corresponds one and only one value of z'.
Consequently, if the inequality (2) holds, equation (1) associates
with each real point Z of the w plane one and only one point Z'
of the superimposed w' plane, and conversely.
This particular one-to-one transformation (13) of the Gauss plane
onto itself is called a homographic transformation of the complex plane,
or, for a reason which will appear soon (76, 77), a direct circular

transformation of the plane.
It is also called a Mobius transformation,
after the name of the German geometer who discovered it in 1853.1
Solved for z', equation (1) of the transformation becomes, by
setting -
j3 = a, -
8 = b, ex = c, I' = d,
z' =
az +b
cz + d'
(3)
We say that z' is a homographic function of z.
74. Determination of the homography.
A
homography is
determined if to three distinct and arbitrarily chosen points ZI' Z2'
Zs we assign, as correspondents or homologues, three distinct and arbi-
trarily chosen points Z~, Z;, Z;.
If

The above proof assumes that all the points are in the finite part
of the plane.
Three cases remain to be considered.

This
equation can be verified also by starting with the second member.
Now suppose
z~ is infinite.
This will be so if, when
ex ~ 0,
we have ZI = -
y!ex, or, when ex = 0, we have ZI =
00.
Since (27)
we have, by expressions analogous to (10),
(11)
In the first case, by replacing y!a by -
ZI' we obtain the desired
relation; in the second case (11) becomes
76. Circular
transformation.
The
homographic transfor-
mation is said to be circular because of the following property.
Every curve of the set consisting of the straight lines and the circles
of the plane is transformed into a curve of this set.
In fact, let I be any straight line or circle, Zl> Z2' Za three fixed
points and Z a moving point on I, and
Z~,
Z~, Z;, Z' their corres-
pondents in any homography of the complex plane.
The anharmonic ratio (ZIZ2ZaZ) is real (28); this is then also
true of (Z~Z;Z~Z') (75), and the point Z' thus describes the straight
line or the circle l' passing through
Z~, Z;, Z; (28).
Article 91 will determine when l' is a straight line.
77. Conservation of angles.
If two curves I, II intersect in a
point Z, whose affix is not -
die, at an angle of algebraic value 8,
then their transforms I',
l~ under the homography of equation (3) intersect
in Z', the homologue of Z, at an angle 8 + kTr, k an integer.
We say that the homography conserves angles (to within kTr) in
both magnitude and sign, or, that the homography is a directly
conformal transformation.

be the equation of l.
The tangent at point Z is parallel to the vector
OT which represents dzjdt, and we can agree to orient the tangent
positively in the sense of this vector.
The equation of I' is
,
af(t) + b
z = ef(t) + d

sponding to Z, which is assumed to be
such that cf(t) + d #

If rp is the argument of (ad -

and, for the curves II'
I~, by an obviously symmetric notation,
From these relations we obtain by subtraction, to within 2kTT,
(OT',OT;) = (01', OTI ) = e.
If the positive sense of the tangent to
I~ at Z' is opposite to the
sense of OT~' its angle with OT' is then e+ (2k + I)TT, which proves
the theorem,
78. Product of two homographies.
The product of two homo-
graphies is a homography.
Let
(XI ZZ1 + f31Z + YIZI + 81 = 0,
be the equation of a homography WI in
corresponds a point ZI' and
(X2Z I Z 2 + f32Z1 + Y2Z 2 + 82 = 0,

GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE HOMOGRAPHY

formation which permits us to pass from Z to Z2.
Its equation

79. Circular group of the plane.
A set of transformations
constitutes a group if it satisfies the following two properties:
10 the product of any two transformations of the set is a trans-
formation of the set ;
20 the inverse (13) of each transformation of the set is contained
in the set.
The set of homographies
,
az + b
Z
--
cz + d'
possesses these two properties by virtue of article 78 and because
the replacement of a by -
d and d by -
a converts equation (15)
into the corresponding inverse transformation.
We call this group
the circular group of the plane.
80. Definitions.
We call a point a double point of a homo-
graphy if it coincides with its homologue.
A homography which is not the identity has at most two double points.
In fact, there exists a single homography having three given double
points (74), and the identity transformation possesses this property.
It is convenient to denote the Gauss plane by w or w' according
as we consider it the set of points Z or that of their transforms Z'
under a homography.
The limit point L of the w plane for a homography w is the
point whose homologue L' is at infinity in w'.
The limit point
M' of the w' plane is the homologue of the point M == L' at infinity
in the w plane.
The points L, M' are thus the homologues of the
point at infinity in the homographies w -1 and w (13).

It
suffices
to
consider
two
corresponding
triangles
ZlZ2Za,
Z~Z;Z;.
We have (75, 82, 10)
(ZlZ2Za 00) =
(Z~Z;Z~ 00)
whence (25), by equating the moduli and then the arguments,
(ZaZ2, ZaZl) =
(Z~Z~,
Z~Z~).
The two triangles are thus directly similar, and the ratio of similitude
IS
4Â° The direct similitudes constitute a group.
In fact, the product of two similitudes is a homography which,
also having the point at infinity as a double point, is a similitude;
this fact also follows from equation (14) 78, for if 1Y1 =
1Y2 = 0 we
have
1Y1'Y2 -
cx2f31 = O.
In addition, the replacement of a by -
d
and of d by -
a converts equation (2) into the corresponding inverse
transformation, and this, we note, is a similitude.
The similitude group, being contained in the circular group, is a
subgroup of the latter.
5Â° Every direct similitude is the product of a rotation, a homothety
having the same center, and a translation, where one or tW(l of these
component transformations may be wanting.
Equation (2) follows, in fact, from the equations

THE SIMILITUDE GROUP
The first represents the identity transformation if a = d, a homothety
with center at the origin if ajd is real but different from unity (16),
a rotation about the origin if ajd is imaginary with unit modulus (15),
the (permutable) product if a homothety and a rotation both centered
at the origin if aid is imaginary with non-unit modulus.
The second
represents a translation or the identity transformation.

83. Center of similitude.
A
similitude which is neither the
identity transformation nor a translation has a double point a in the
finite part of the plane and called a center of similitude; the similitude
is the permutable product of a rotation and a homothety both centered
at a, one or the other of these two transformations perhaps being wanting.
A translation has only the point at infinity f(.>r double point (82, 10).
A point a of affix w is a double point for the similitude with
equation (2) if
or
w(d-a) = b.
If d = a, b = 0, every point a is a double point, and (2) represents
the identity transformation.
If d = a, b *" 0, there is no finite point a, and (2) represents a
translation.
If d *" a, the only value of w is
b
w = d-a'
For the origin at a we have

84. Determination of a similitude.
A direct similitude is deter-
mined by two pairs of corresponding points.
These two pairs, and the point at infinity in the Gauss plane
considered as a double point, determine a homography (74, 30).

85. Group of translations.
The translations of the plane form
a group.
The product of the translations with equations
has for equation
Z2 = Z + al + a2
and is a translation of vector equal to the sum of the vectors of the
given translations.
Moreover, the set
z'=z+a
of translations contains the inverse of each transformation of the set.
86. Group of displacements.
The translations and the rotations
of the plane form a group called the group of displacements.
The similitude with equation (2) is a translation if the coefficient
aid of z has the value 1, and a rotation about the center of similitude
if aid is imaginary with modulus I (83).

I, and
the product of these similitudes having for equation
Zz =
P2PlZ + P2gI + g2
(5)
is itself a translation or a rotation.
Also, the inverse of ZI = Piz + ql
is Zl
=
zlpl - qllpl' which is again a translation or a rotation.
It follows that the translations and the rotations form a group.
We call this group the group of displacements for the following
reason.
If a figure (F) is arbitrarily displaced in its plane so as
finally to occupy a position (F'), then the figures (F), (F') are directly
equal.
That is, (F') corresponds to (F) under a direct similitude
whose ratio of similitude is I.
This similitude then has an equation
of the form
Z' = pz + g,
I P I =
1

87. GROUP OF TRANSLATIONS AND HOMOTHETIES
139
and is a translation or a rotation capable, just as the considered
displacement, of carrying (F) into coincidence with (F').
Corollaries.
10 Every transformation of this group conserves the
magnitude and the sense of each angle, as well as the length of each
segment.
20 The rotations do not constitute a group, but rotations having the
same center do constitute a group.
In fact, equations (4) represent rotations if
and (5) represents a translation if
ei (6 1+6,) = 1
or
81 + 82 = 2k-rr, (k an integer).
On the other hand, if the rotations have the same center, say
the origin, we have q1 = q2 = 0 and (5) represents a rotation.
87. Group of translations and homotheties.
The equation
z' = pz + q
represents a translation if p = 1, and a homothety if p is real but
different from 0 and 1 (83).
If each of the equations (4) represents
a translation or a homothety, then so also does equation (5).
More-
over, the inverse of a translation or a homothety is another translation
or homothety.
The translations and the homotheties therefore form
a group.
Corollaries.
10 Every transformation of this group conserves the
magnitude and the sense of each angle, as well as the direction of each
segment, and changes the length of each segment in a constant ratio.
20 The homotheties do not constitute a group, but the homotheties
having the same center do constitute a group.
The product of two homotheties not having the same center is a
translation if the ratios of the homotheties are reciprocals of one another,
otherwise it is a homothety whose center is on the line which joins the
centers of the given homotheties.
Suppose the center of the first homothety, with equation (4), is
at the origin; then q1
=
O.
If q2 01::- 0, (5) represents a translation
if PIP2 =
1, a homothety if P1P2 01::- 1; when q2 = 0, (5) represents
a homothety or the identity transformation.
If (4) and (5) represent

140
THE SIMILITUDE GROUP
homotheties, the affixes of their centers, with ql = Â°and q2 =1= 0, are
and are thus collinear.
88. Permutable similitudes.
Two direct similitudes are per-
mutable (22) if they are two translations or if they have the same center.
If we reverse the order of the similitudes Wl' w 2 characterized
by the coefficients Pl' ql and P2' q2 of equations (4), these equations
are replaced by
and the equation of the product WlW 2 is
z~ = PIP2Z + PIq2 + qp
(6)
We will have W2Wl
=
W l W 2 if the second members of equations
(5) and (6) are equal, and hence if
qI(1- P2) = q2(1 -
PI)Â·
(7)
When Pl = I, so that Wl is a translation, it is necessary that P2 = I
or ql = 0, that is, that W 2 be a translation or W l be the identity trans-
formation.
The last case affirms that the identity transformation
is permutable with every similitude, which is obvious.
When Pl and P2 are different from I, equation (7) states that
qI
q2
--=--,
I-PI
I-P2
and hence that the centers of similitude of WI and W2 coincide (83).
89. Involutoric similitude.
The only direct involutoric similitude
is the symmetry with respect to a point.
The direct similitude with equation
z' = pz + q
(8)
is involutoric if (23) it coincides with its inverse with equation
z = pz' + q,
and therefore if for all z
z = p2z + pq + q
so that

90. APPLICATION
141
If P =
1, it is necessary that q = 0, and equation (8) represents
the identity transformation.
If p = -
1, we have
z'=-z+q
which represents (15, 16) the symmetry with respect to the point
of affix q/2.
90. Application.
We shall examine some properties
of the
following figure which is encountered in electrical studies: being
given a triangle ABC, consider the triples of directly similar triangles
BCA', CAB', ABC'.
One of these triples is determined when A' is chosen, and we
have the three direct similitudes

Similarly, the equations of fl, yare

a'(e-a) + b'(e-b) + ab-e2 = O.

THE SIMILITUDE GROUP
If the origin is assumed at A, then a = 0 and we have
l-=l-+l.

whence the indicated construction for Sa (31, 20).
2Â° Point Sa is common to the circle passing through C and tangent
to AB at A and the circle passing through B and tangent to AC at A.
This construction is that of article 83 utilizing the two pairs of
equal pencils
C(AS aâ€¢â€¢â€¢) A A(BS a â€¢â€¢â€¢ ),
A(CS a...) A B(ASa...)
if we note that to the ray in the first pencil joining the centers C and A,
there must correspond in the second pencil the tangent AB at the
center A.
3Â° The centroid of triangle A'B'C' is fixed and coincides with the
centroid G of triangle ABC.
Point A' is determined if we know
I

(BC, BA') = 8.

The vertices of triangle A'B'C' are thus fixed by means of a common
complex parameter ".
Addition of equations (10), (11), (12), member by member, gives
a' + b' + c' =
a + b + c,
which establishes the property (38).
4Â° If ABC is equilateral, so also is A'B'C'.
IfABC is not equilateral,
the only two equilateral triangles A'B'C' have their vertices at the
centroids of the equilateral triangles constructed on BC, CA, AB, all
exterior to triangle ABC or all interior to triangle ABC.

Theorem II.
For a straight line or a circle (C) of the w plane to
transform into a straight line (C') of the w' plane, it is necessary and
sufficient that (C) contain the limit point L of w.
It is necessary, for if (C') is a straight line it must contain the
point L' at infinity in w', and then (C) contains L.
It is sufficient, for if (C) contains L, the transform (C') contains
L' and is therefore a straight line.
Corollary.
The pencil of lines having vertex L is the only pencil
which transforms into a pencil of lines, and this pencil has M' for vertex.
Theorem III.

at the limit points L, M' are inversely equal, and if Z, Z' are any
two corresponding points, the product

which establishes the inverse equality of the pencils.
Remark.
The angle of the two axes intersecting in the limit point L
is conserved in magnitude but not in sense (see article 77).
92. Double points.
Theorem I.
If a homography of the complex
plane is not a similitude, it possesses two double points E and F in the
finite part of the plane and the midpoint of segment EF coincides with
the midpoint of the segment determined by the limit points Land M'.
When the double points coincide, the homography is said to be para-
bolic.
The affixes e, f of the double points (80) are the roots of the equation
ez2-(a-d)z-b = 0
obtained by setting z' = z in (l), whence

e = 2)a -

f =

The homography is parabolic if
(a -
d)2 + 4 be = o.
The segments EF, LM' have the same midpoint, for from (4)
and (2) we obtain
a-d
e +f = -- = 1+ m'.

Theorem II.
If the homography is not parabolic, the anharmonic
ratio formed by the double points and any two corresponding points
is a real or imaginary constant A, different from 0, I,
00.
This property applies also to a similitude which is not a translation.

93. Decomposition of a homography.
If a homography is not
a similitude, it is a product of similitudes, an inversion, and a symmetry
with respect to a line.
From equation (3) we find
,
,
be-ad
z = m + e2(z -I) .
we have
,
,
be-ad
z = m + --2-Z2'
e
We thus pass from Z to Zl by a translation, from Zl to Z2 by an
inversion of center 0 and power I followed by a symmetry with
respect to Ox (9), and then from Z2 to Z' by a similitude.
94. Definitions.
The constant (92)
(EFZZ') = ,\
is called the invariant of the homography.
The homography, assumed
not to be the identity transformation, is parabolic if,\ = I, hyperbolic
if ,\ is real but different from 0 and I, elliptic if ,\ is imaginary with
unit modulus and therefore of the form
eirJ. with ex not an integral
multiple of 7T, and lflxodromic if,\ is imaginary with non-unit modulus.
The corresponding cases for the similitude are: translation, homo-
thety, rotation, and product of a rotation and a concentric homothety.

The limit points L, M' are
the midpoint of their join.
The
line LM' is double for the

95. PARABOLIC HOMOGRAPHY
151
2Â° Any two corresponding points Z, Z' are on the circle y passing
through Z and tangent to line LM' at E.
The ohomography is the product of the symmetry with respect to the
perpendicular bisector p of segment LM' and the inversion having center
M' and power (LM')2/4, or of the inversion (L, (LM')2/4) and the
symmetry having axis p.
We orient the line LZ
=
d from L toward Z.
Since line LM'
is double, point Z' is (91, III) on the axis d' which is symmetric
to d with respect to p, and is such that we have in magnitude and sign
LZ.M'Z' = LE2.
If Z~ is the symmetric of Z with respect to p, we have
M'Z~.M'Z' = M'E2,
which establishes the property.
It follows that every circle y tangent to LM' at E is transformed
into itself by the parabolic homography.
We say that such a circle
is anallagmatic.
3Â° If the points Z, Z' move on the fixed axes d, d', the line ZZ' envelops
the circle E having center E and tangent to d, d'.
The equation (9) of the homography is
2(z -
e) (z' -
e) = (z -
z') (m' -I)
(12)
and gives, if we equate the moduli of the two members,
[ EZ.EZ' [ = [ZZ'.LE [.
Denoting the radius of y by R and the distance from E to the line
ZZ' by h we have, for the inscribed triangle EZZ',
I EZ.EZ' I = 2Rh,
and hence
h =
I ZZ'. LE I
2R
.
But I ZZ'/2R I is the sine of the inscribed angle ZEZ', which
is equal to angle ELZ.
Therefore h is equal to the distance from
E to d, and ZZ' is tangent to the circle E.
We also conclude that in a parabolic homography the quotient
I
EZ.EZ' I
ZZ'
is constant and equal to half the distance between the limit points.

NON-SIMILITUDE HOMOGRAPHY
4Â° The equation of the parabolic homography is
1

--z-=e- z' -e = l-m'Â·
(13)
The homography is determined by its limit points, or by its double point
and a pair of corresponding points.
The double point and an arbitrary point Z are harmonic conjugates
with respect to the homologues Z', Z" of Z in the homography and
in the inverse of the homography.
Equation (13) is obtained from equation (12) by replacing z -
z'
by
(z -

(z' -

and by dividing the two
members
by
(z -

96. Hyperbolic homography.
10 Any two corresponding points
Z, Z' and the double points E, F lie on a common circle y.
Every
circle passing through E and F is anallagmatic.
In fact, the invariant (EFZZ') = A is real (28).
20 The limit points lie on the line EF, have the same midpoint as
segment EF, and are inside or outside the segment EF according as
Ais negative or positive.
The line LM' is a double line of the homo-
graphy.

We shall study in Â§ IV the case where the limit points coincide.
3Â° The homography is the product of the symmetry with respect to
the perpendicular bisector p of segment LM' and the inversion which,
having its center at the limit point M', exchanges the double points,

98. Siebeck's theorem. l
The double points E, F of a direct
circular transformation are the foci of the conic enveloped by the line
joining two variable corresponding points Z, Z' lying on two corresponding
lines d, d' radiating from the limit points L, M'.
The transformation determines on d
and d' two projective point ranges which
are not perspective if the point dd' is
not E or F.
Line ZZ' then envelops
a conic y tangent to d and d'.
The
center of y is the midpoint of LM', for,
M'
Land M' being the limit points of the
FIG. 51
ranges (Z) and (Z'), the parallels to d'
and d drawn through Land M' are tangents to y.
The pencils E(Z), E(Z') are projective and their double rays are
the tangents to y drawn from E.
It follows that E will be a focus

Its proof is

Let Zl' Z~ be two other corresponding points on d, d'.
From

(EZl> EZ') + (EZ', EZ) =

(EZ', EZ) =
(EZ~, EZI ) Â± 7T,
which is what we had to establish. I
Corollary.

midpoints is an ellipse C called the inscribed Steiner ellipse of the triangle; it has the

87. Invariant of a direct similitude.
The invariant is I for a translation,
imaginary with unit modulus for a rotation of angle different from (2k + 1)1T, real and
different from 1 and 0 for a homothety (- 1 for a symmetry), imaginary with non-
unit modulus for the remaining case.
These similitudes can then be called parabolic,
elliptic, hyperbolic, and loxodromic, respectively.
The anallagmatic lines and circles are, respectively, the parallels to the translation
vector, the circles centered at the center of rotation, the lines drawn through the center
of homothety and, if the homothety is a symmetry, the circles centered at the center of
homothety.
There are no anallagmatic lines or circles in the last case.
88. In a loxodromic homography, the point of intersection of two corresponding
lines describes an equilateral hyperbola which passes through the double points E,
F and on which the limit points L, M' are diametrically opposite one another.

circle of diameter OK (the Brocard circle), and that line LM' (the Lemoine line) is the
polar of K in (0).
The angle (OK, on) is the Brocard angle of triangle ABC.
90. A homography admits an irreducible cyclic set of order n only if its invariant
has the form
where n1 is a positive integer less than n and prime to n, and it suffices to take n1< n/2.
Each point of the plane is then the start of a cyclic set of order n.
If n > 2, the homography is elliptic.
Each cyclic set is situated on an anallagmatic
circle and constitutes a harmonic (Casey) polygon, transformed from a regular polygon
by an inversion whose center is a double point of the homography.

1889, p. 50 and 1932, p. 275.]

IV.
MOBIUS INVOLUTION
99. Equation.
A homography of the complex plane
,
az + b
z =---
cz + d
is involutoric, and is called a Mobius involution, if
(1)
a + d =
O.
(2)
In fact, it is necessary and sufficient that equation (I) be identical
to the inverse homography (23)
az' + b
z =
cz' + d'
If we write the two homographies as
czz' -
az + dz' -
b = 0,
czz' + dz -
az' -
b = 0
we conclude that (2) is the sought condition.

101. PROPERTIES
From the form
czz' -
a(z + z') -
b = 0
we see that an equation of the involution is symmetric in z and z'.
159
FIG. 52
Corollary.
If Z' is the homologue of Z, then Z is the homologue
of Z'.
We say that Z and Z' doubly correspond, or are conjugate,
in the involution.
100. Sufficient condition.
In order that a homography be in-
volutoric, it is sufficient th.at two distinct homologous points doubly
correspond.
In fact, if Zo'
Z~ are two such homologous points, we have the
identities
czoZ~ -
azo+ dz~ -
b == 0,
cz~zo -
az~ + dzo-
b == 0,
which, by subtracting member from member, give
(a + d) (z~- zo) == 0
or, since Zo * z~, gives a + d =
O.
10I. Properties.
1Â° A M 6bius involution is a hyperbolic homo-
graphy whose invariant has the value -
1.
It suffices to set a + d
=
0 in equation
(5) of article 92 to find that A =
-
1.
This
fact is immediate in the case of an involutoric
similitude (89).
2Â° The double points E, F and any two
conjugate points Z, Z' are vertices of a harmonic
quadrangle (30).
3Â° The limit points L, M' coincide at the
midpoint of segment EF, the conjugate of the
point at infinity of the Gauss plane, and called
the central point of the involution.
4Â° The product of the distances of the central
point from two conjugate points is a constant
called the power of the involution, and is equal
to the square of the distance from the central point to a double point.
The line determined by the double points interiorly bisects the angle

160
MOBIUS INVOLUTION
formed by the lines joining the central point to the two conjugate points
(30, 91).
5Â° The line EF and its perpendicular at L are double lines for the
Mobius involution.
The first line carries a hyperbolic involution of
points having E, F for double points; the second line carries an
elliptic involution of power -
LP.
6Â° The circles passing through E, F, as well as the orthogonal tra-
jectories of these circles, are anallagmatic.
In fact, the orthogonal
trajectory passing through Z also passes through Z' (30).
7Â° A Mobius involution is the product of the inversion of center L
and power -
LP and the symmetry with respect to the perpendicular
bisector of EF.
These transformations are permutable (96).
102. Determination of an involution.
An involution is deter-
mined if we are given any two pairs of conjugate points,. the points
of one or of both pairs may coincide.
Let Zl'
Z~ and Z2'
Z~ be the two given pairs of points.
If
Zl ==
Z~, Z2 ==
Z~,
then these points are the double points of
the involution, and the involution is determined inasmuch as the
homologue of any point Z is the harmonic conjugate of Z with
respect to the double points (101).
If Zl is distinct from Z~, there
exists a unique homography of the complex plane in which Zl' Z~,
Z2 have for homologues
Z~, Zl'
Z~ (74), and it is an involution
inasmuch as the distinct points Zl> Z~ correspond doubly (100).
Equation.
First form.
If
Zl,
z~ and
Z2,
z~ are the affixes
of the given points, the involution has an equation of the form (99)
azz' + b(z + z') + c = 0
with the conditions
The sought equation is then

If Z1'
z~ and Z2'
z~ are gzven as roots of the
equations
ar
2 + 2b2z + C2 = 0,
the affixes of an arbitrary pair of conjugate points
are the roots of the equation
a1z 2 + 2b1z + C1+ ,\(a2z2 + 2b2z + c2) = 0,
(6)
in which ,\ is a parameter able to take on all complex values.
The usual equation
rxzz' + f3(z + z') + y = Â°
of an involution says that there exists a constant linear relation
between the product and the sum of the affixes of two conjugate
points.
For Zl> Z~ and Z2' Z; we must then have
(XCI -
2f3b1+ yal = 0,
(7)
(XC2 -
2f3b2+ ya2 = 0,
(8)
and for any conjugate pair of points whose affixes are the roots of
az2+ 2bz + c = 0,
(9)
we will have
exc -
2f3b + ya = 0.
From (7), (8), (10) we obtain
I ::

:: I = Â°

and consequently, if J1'1' J1'2 are two arbitrary complex numbers,
a =
J1'l a l + J1'2a2,
b =
J1'l bl + J1'2b2'
C = J1'I C1+ J1''Jh.
It suffices to substitute these values into (9) and to set J1'2/J1'1 =,\
in order to obtain (6).
Affixes of the double points.
If an involution is given by (3),
the affixes of the double points are the roots of

MOBIUS INVOLUTION
In the case of equation (6), the ..\'s for the double points annul the
discriminant
(..\a2 + a1) (..\c2 + c1) -
(..\b2 + bl )2
and the sought affixes are the values of
..\b2 + bl
..\a2 + a 1
for each of the ..\'s found.
But we can also form an equation of the
these affixes e, f for roots.
Let it be
rz2 + 2sz + t = O.
Since we must have
second degree having
(11)
(efz1z{) = -
1
or
(30, II)
it is necessary that
(e + f) (Zl + z{) = 2(ef + zlz{),
(12)
and, similarly,
rC2 -
2sb2 + ta2 = O.
From (11), (12), (13) we obtain the sought equation
(13)
FIG. 53
C'
103. Theorem.
If the four sides of a complete quadrilateral are
in the finite part of the plane, the three pairs of opposite vertices are
three pairs of conjugate points in a Mobius involution.
Let (A, A'), (B, B'), (C,
C') be the three pairs of op-
posite vertices, A, B, C lying
on a common side.
At least
two of these pairs are com-
posed of proper points; let
A, A' be one of the pairs.
There exists a unique homo-
graphy
w
of the
complex
C
plane in which A, B, C have
A, C', B' for homologues ; A
is
a
double
point
in this
homography.
The homography determines on the corresponding
lines ABC, AB/C' two projective ranges
ABC ... 7\ AC'B'

104. CONSTRUCTION DEFINED BY TWO PAIRS OF POINTS
163
which, having point A in common, are perspective from center A'.
The limit points Land M' of these ranges, lying on the parallels
to AB' and AB drawn through A', are also the limit points of w.
The second double point of w is thus A' (92, I) and we have (75)
(AA'BC) = (AA'C'B').
Hence we also have (26)
(AA'BC) = (A'AB'C'),
an equation which proves that in the homography of the complex
plane which assigns A', B', C' as the homologues of A, B, C, the
points A, A' doubly correspond; this homography is then an in-
volution (100).
Corollary. fr c, C' are at infinity, the involution is a symmetry
with respect to the center of the parallelogram ABA'B' (89).
104. Construction of the involution defined by two pairs
of points AA', BB'.
It suffices to construct the double points E, F, for then any
pair of corresponding points Z, Z' can be constructed by (30)
(EFZZ') = -
1.
Case I, A, A', B, B' collinear.
a) If the pairs AA', BB' do not
separate one another (Fig. 54), E, F are the double points of the
hyperbolic involution (AA', BB') determined on the double line
AA'BB'.
The radical axis a of any two circles ex, f3 passing through
A, A' and B, B' intersects this line at the central point O.
The
circle y of center 0 and orthogonal to ex contains E, F.
FIG. 54
A
FIG. 55
b) If AA', BB' separate one another, the double line AA'BB' is
the perpendicular bisector of the segment EF, and the points E,
F are common to the circles ex, f3 having AA', BB' for diameters
(Fig. 55).

164
MOBIUS INVOLUTION
Case 2, A, A', B collinear (Fig. 56).
The line AA'B transforms,
by the involution, into the circle 'Y = A'AB', which thus contains
the central point O.
In order to determine 0, we note that
(BAA' 00) =
(B'A'AO) = (OAA'B'),
whence, if P is the second point of 'Y on the parallel to AA'B drawn
through B', we have
P(BAA' 00) = P(OAA'B')
and point 0 is on the line PB.
B
FIG. 56
The problem becomes that of constructing E, F such that (EFAA')
=
-
1 and such that 0 shall be the midpoint of EF (31).
The
interior bisector OJ of angle AOA' is cut in E, F by the circle S
passing through A and A' and having its center K on the exterior
bisector of this angle.
Case 3, A, A', B, B' are the vertices of a quadrangle.
a) If A'
is at infinity, then A is the central point and E, F are such that
(EFBB') =
-
1 with A as the midpoint of EF (31).
b) If the four points are proper points, let C, C' be the points
(AB, A'B'), (AB', BA').
Points C, C' are conjugate points in the
involution, for they form the third pair of opposite vertices of the
quadrilateral having sides a
=
AB'C', b =
BC'A', c
=
CA'B',
d = ABC (103).
The involution transforms the lines a, b, c, d into
the
circles a' =
A'BC,
b' = B'CA, c' = C'AB,
d' = A'B'C',
which then have in common the central point of the involution
(91, II).
The double
points E, F are the intersections
of the
interior bisector p of angle BOB', for example, with the circle f3

In a complete quadrilateral abed, the circles circum-

The angles subtended at Â° by the diagonals AA', BB', CC' have
the same interior bisector p.
The circles passing through the pairs of opposite vertices (A, A'),

PERMUTABLE HOMOGRAPHIES
105. Sufficient condition.
A sufficient condition for two hom(l-
graphies of the complex plane to be permutable is that they have the
same double points.
We know that for two similitudes the condition is both necessary
and sufficient (88).

106, 107. THEOREMS

Parabolic homographies.
If E is the double point common to
the parabolic homographies with equations (95)

to Z", the homography associating Z with Z" has the equation

-----=a +a2

z" -e
I
(2)
and is parabolic with double point E.
If we interchange the roles
of the first two homographies, which amounts to interchanging the
constants aI' a2 in equation (1), the product is again given by (2).
Non-parabolic homographies.
Let E, F be the common double
points and let Al and A2 be the invariants of the two homographies
WI' w 2â€¢
The equations of these homographies are (92, III)
(ejzz') = AI'
(ejz'z") = A2
and the equation of W 2W1 is
(ejzz') (ejz'z") = (ejzz") = AIA2â€¢
The product is thus a homography with double points E, F and invariant
A1A2 ; it is therefore the same as W1W2'
106. The homographies permutable with a parabolic homography WI
with double point E are the parabolic pomographies with double point E.
Any homography W 2 permutable with WI must have E for double
point.
Otherwise, let E 2 be the homologue of E in
W2;
it will
also be the homologue of E in W 2W1 (21), and can be the homologue
of E in WIW2 only if E 2 is double for WI' which is impossible since
E is the only double point of WI'
Homography
W 2 cannot have a double point F 2 distinct from E.
In fact, the homologue F 21 of F 2 in WI is distinct from E and F 2'
and is also the homologue of F 2 in w1w2; it cannot, on the other
hand, be the homologue of F 2 in W2W1 since it is not double for W 2â€¢
The sought w2's must then have the unique double point E, which
is sufficient (105).
107. A non-involutoric homography WI with double points E, F is
permutable with only one involution I, namely that which has E, F
for double points.

168
PERMUTABLE HOMOGRAPHIES
or (26)
If E is not double for I, its conjugate E' in I cannot be distinct
from F, for E/, the homologue of E in IWl, would not be the homo-
logue of E in wlI as it should be if WI and I are permutable.
If E' is at F, it is the homologue of E in IWI and in wlI.
But then
the conjugate of F in I is E, and the double points X, Y of I are
such that (EFXY)
=
-
1.
The homologue Xl of X in WI is
the homologue of X in wlI but not that of X in IWI because WI'
being non-involutoric, cannot have its invariant (EFXX l ) equal to
-
1, and Xl is not double for I.
The hypothesis thus does not
give an involution I which is permutable with WI'
lt is therefore necessary that E be double for I and, by the first
part of the argument, that F be the second double point of I.
This
condition is sufficient (105).
The involution I is the united involution of the. homography.
Corollary.
If Al and A_I are the homologues of a point A in the
homography WI and in its inverse wIl , the conjugate of A tn the united
involution I is its harmonic conjugate A" with respect to Al and L
l .
We have the equation (92, II)
(EFA_I A) = (EFAAl ),
(EFA_I A) = (FEAIA),
proving (100) that A is double for a Mobius involution admitting
the pairs EF, A_lAl .
If A" is the second double point we then have
(EFAA") = -
I,
(A_1A1AA") = -I,
which establishes the corollary.
Remark. When WI is parabolic with double point E, point A"
is always at E (95, 40 ).
108. Harmonic involutions.
A necessary and sufficient condition
for two distinct involutions to be permutable is that the double points
of one be harmonic conjugates with respect to the double pnints of the
other.
We also say that the involutions are harmonic.
Let 11' 12 be two involutions with double points E l , F1 and E 2,
F 2' and with equations
a1zz1+ bl (z + Zl) + Cl = 0,
a2z1z2 + b2(ZI + Z2) + C2 = o.

109. THEOREM
169
The homography 1211 has for equation (78)
(a1b2-
a2b})zz2 + (a}c2-
b}b2)z + (b}b2-
a2c})z2 + b}c2-
b2c} = Â°
(3)
and is identical to the homography 1112 with equation
(a2b} -
a1b2)zz2 + (a2c1-
b2b1)z + (b2b} -
a1c2)z2 + b2c1-
b}c2 = Â°
(4)
if the coefficients of equations (3) and (4) are proportional.
Since
11 and 12 are distinct, the matrix
II

is of rank 2.
If b1 or b2 is not zero, we do not have simultaneously
a1b2-
a2b1 = 0,
b1C2 -
b2c1 = 0,
and the quotient of two corresponding coefficients in (3) and (4)
is -
1.
The coefficients of z or of Z2 give
(5)
the double points
a1c2-
2b1b2+ c1a2 =
0,
which is a necessary and sufficient condition that
of 11' 12 whose affixes are roots of
a1z2 + 2b1z + C1 = 0,
form a harmonic quadruple (102).
If b1 = b2 = 0, we have a1c2-
a2c1 =1= 0 and (3) and (4)
1211 = 1112 if a 1c2 + a 2c} = 0, which is (5).
we obtain
Corollary.
If two Mobius involutions with double points E1, F 1
and E 2, F 2 are harmonic, their product is a new involution with double
points E3, F3' and each pair of these three involutions is harmonic;
the quadrangles E}E2FIF2' E2E3F 2F3' E3E 1F3F 1 are harmonic (30).
In fact, (5) says that in (3) the coefficients of z, Z2 are equal, and
1211 is an involution 13.
From the equation
1211 =
13
121111 = 131}
or (23)
12 = 1311â€¢
Since the product 131} is an involution, the reasoning above permits
us to conclude that II' 13 are also harmonic.
In the same way we
show that 12, 13 are harmonic.
109. A necessary and sufficient condition for two non-involutoric
homographies to be permutable is that they have the same double points.
We know that this theorem is true if one of the homographies
is parabolic (106).
If the given homographies WI' W2 are not para-

170
PERMUTABLE HOMOGRAPHIES
bolic, let E, F be the double points of WI'
If E is not double for
W 2, its homologue E 2 in W2 is also the homologue of E in W2WI,
and in order that E 2 be at the same time the homologue of E in
WIW 2, it must be double for
WI' and hence be at F.
Similarly,
the homologue F 2 of F in
W2' not being F, will have to be E.
Consequently, E, F will correspond doubly in
W 2, which will thus
be involutoric, which is contrary to the hypothesis.
It is necessary,
then, that E be double for
W 2, and we easily conclude that F must
be double for W2'
These conditions are, moreover, sufficient (105).
Corollary.
A non-involutoric homography is permutable with the
homographies having the same double points, and, in particular, with
its united involution (107) if it is not parabolic.
A Mobius involution is permutable with the homographies for which
it is the united involution, and with the involutions which have its
double points for conjugate points (108).
110. A necessary and sufficient condition for the product of a homo-
graphy wand an involution I to be an involution is that the double
points of W be conjugate points in 1.
We say that I is harmonic to w.
If the equations of wand I are
ex.zz' + f3z + yz' + S = 0,
(6)
az'z" + bz' + bz" + c =
0,
(7)
that of Iw is
(ex.b-f3a)zz" + (cx.e-f3b)z + (yb-Sa)z" +yc-Sb = 0

10 If w is parabolic, its double point is also double
for J.
20 Every homography w is, in a double infinity of ways, the product

171
of two Mobius involutions,. these have the double points of W as a common
pair of points.
In fact, from Iw = J we obtain W
= 1], since 12 = 1.
We deter-
mine an involution I by arbitrarily selecting one of its double points.
Since the equation Iw = J can be written as I = Jw-l and since w,
w-l have the same double points, we conclude that these points are
also conjugate points in J.
III. Simultaneous invariant of two
homographies.
As
generalizations of articles 108 and 110, we can consider two homo-
graphies WI' w 2 with equations
(XIZ Zl + f31z + yIZl +Â°
1 = 0,
(X2Z1Z2+ f32Z1+ Y2Z2+Â°2 = 0
whose product W 2WI, with equation (78)

is an involution.
It is necessary and sufficient that we have (99) equality of the
coefficients of z and z 2' or
(XI02 -
f31f32 -
YIY2 + (X201 = O.
(9)
The left member of this equation is a simultaneous invariant of
Corollaries.
1Â° If WI'

L I ,

2Â° Assuming W 2 == WI' we have the condition

112. Transform of a homography.
In a homography Wi, the
homologue of a point A or A k will be designated by Ai or Akiâ€¢
Let A, Al be any two cor-
responding points of a homography
WI' and let A2, Al2 be the homo-
logues of A, Al in a homography
W2'
The
correspondence which
connects A2 and Au as A moves
in the Gauss plane is the product
of the
successive
homographies
W;\ WI' w2 and is therefore (78) the homography
(12)
This homography W is called the transform of WI by W 2â€¢
To any two corresponding points A, Al in the homography WI that
is transformed, the transforming homography
W 2 associates two cor-
responding points A 2, A l2 in the transformed homography w.
In particular, each double point of WI is transformed into a double
point of w.
Since, on the other hand, a homography does not alter
anharmonic ratios, the homographies
WI and ware simultaneously
parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptic, or l(lxodromic with the same invariant,
and a Mobius involution is transformed into a Mobius involution.
The permutability of the homographies WI' w 2 which IS expressed
by
(13)
is related as follows to the notion of the transform of one homography
by another.
Multiply the two members of (13) on the right by
Wi!, then
by wII (21).
Since w 2wi1 = WIWII =
1, we have
By virtue of (12), these equations say that if WI' W 2 are two permutable
hom(lgraphies, each is transformed into itself by the other, whence any
two corresponding points in the one are transformed by the other into
two points which are also corresponding points in the first homography.

IÂ° An antigraphy is the product of a symmetry

Corollary.
An antigraphy leaves real anharmonic ratios invariant.
4Â° The product of a homography and an antigraphy is an antigraphy.
The product of two antigraphies is a homography.

equations

A.
ANTISIMILITUDE
115. Equation.
The antigraphy with equation (1) or (2) is called
an antisimilitude if ex =
C = 0, and it then has an equation of the form
Z' = pz + q.
It is the product of the symmetry with respect to Ox and a similitude
(114, 81).
116. Properties.
I. Any antisimilitude has the point at infinity
for a double point.
It transforms any straight line into a straight line,
any circle into a circle, and any triangle into an inversely similar triangle
for which the ratio of similitude of the second to the first is I p I.
As Z approaches 00, so does z'.
The straight line or the circle having equation
at + b
Z - --
t a real parameter
(4)
-
ct + d'
is transformed into the curve having the equation
,
(pa + qc) t + pb + qd
Z
=
_
ct + d
which represents (41) a straight line or a circle according as (4)
represents a straight line or a circle.
If ZlZ2Z3,
Z~Z~Z; are
two
corresponding triangles, we
have
(114, 3Â°)
(ZlZ2Z3 00) =
(Z~Z~Z~ 00)
and, by expressing that the moduli are equal while the arguments
are opposite,
(Z3Z2' Z3Z1) = -
(Z~Z;, Z~Z~).

176
ANTIGRAPHY
The triangles are thus inversely similar and the ratio of similitude
I Z~Z~JZIZ2 I is Ip I (82).
This is why an antisimilitude is also
called an inverse similitude.
II. An antisimilitude is determined by two pairs,

III. An antisimilitude is an inversely conformal transformation,. it
preserves the magnitudt of each angle but reverses its sense.
This follows from property I.
117. Symmetry.
lo The symmetry with respect to the line d
having equation (37)
az + az + b = 0,
b real
is the antisimilitude with ratio 1 and with equation
az' + az + b = Â°
(5)
and whose double points are all the points of the line d.
The line d contains the point S with affix -
bJ2a and is parallel
to the vector representing the number iii (37); it therefore also
contains the point T with affix -
bJ2a + iii.
In order that two
points Z', Z be symmetric with respect to d, it is necessary and
sufficient that triangles Z'ST, ZST be inversely similar, or that (116)

118. DOUBLE POINTS
177
2Â° The antisimilitude with equation
z' = pz + q
(6)
is a symmetry with respect to a line if I p I = 1 and pq + q = 0.
It is necessary and sufficient that the equation
z-pz-q = Â° or
Az->"PZ->..q = Â°
represent a real straight line, and therefore, if r is a real number,
that we have (37)
,\ = ->..p,
Aq = r.
The first equation says that Ip I = 1.
If q = 0, the second equation
is realized; if q *- 0, elimination of >.. gives pij + q = 0.
3Â° Symmetry with respect to a line is the only involutoric antisimilitude.
The antisimilitude with equation (6) is an involution if its square,
with equation
z" = pz' + q = p(pz + ij) + q
or
z" = ppz + pij + q,
(7)
is the identity transformation (23), that is, if
pp = 1,
pij + q = 0.
It is then (see 20) a symmetry with respect to a line.
4Â° An antisimilitude is involutoric when there exists a pair of distinct
corresponding points Z, Z' which correspond doubly.
Such a pair of points gives the relations

of the unknowns
and, contrary to hypothesis, we would have z' = z.
It is necessary,
then, that Pi> = I, and that the condition of compatibility of the
equations, q + pij = 0, hold, whence the property.
118. Double points.
In addition to the point at
infinity, an
antisimilitude possesses
lOa proper double point if the ratio of similitude is different from 1 ;

2Â° a line of double points if it is a symmetry with respect to a line;
3Â° nQ proper double point in the case of an inverse equality which
is not a symmetry.
The affixes of the possible double points of the antisimilitude
with equation
Z' = pz + q
are the roots of the equation
z-pz-q = 0,
(8)
and hence also those of the conjugate equation
- pz + z-
ij = o.
By considering these two
linear equations in z, z,
we find,
if

pp #- 0,

ij+pq
Z= 1-#'
q + pij
I-pp'
z=
whence 1Â°.
When pp = 1, or Ip I = 1, the equations are compatible if
pij + q = o.
The antisimilitude is the symmetry with respect to the line having
equation (8) (117,20 and 10), whence 2Â°.
If the equations are incompatible, we have 3Â°.
119. Construction of the double point E.
Suppose the inverse
similitude is given by the two pairs of corresponding points Zl'
Z~ and Z2' Z~ such that I Z~Z~/Z1Z2 I #- 1.
First method.
Since we must have
(9)
E is common to the circles 1'1> 1'2 which are the loci of points the
ratio of whose distances from Zl' Z~ or Z2'
Z~ is
1 Z~Z~/Z1Z2 I.
But the center Ed of the direct similitude determined by the same
pairs Zl,
Z~ and Z2'
Z~
also satisfies equations (9) (83)
and is
common to 1'1' 1'2Â°
Since we can recognize Ed with the assistance
of the circle containing the points Zl,
Z~, (ZlZ2'
Z~Z~) (83), point E
is determined by elimination.
Second method.
Point E is also a double point for the square
of the antisimilitude, the equation of which is (7).
This represents

121. LIMIT POINTS
179
a homothety since pp is real and different from unity by hypothesis.
The lines joining two pairs of corresponding points in this homothety
then intersect in E.
Therefore, if we construct the triangles Z~Z~Z~', Z~Z~Z~' respectively
inversely similar to the triangles ZlZ2Z~, ZlZ2Z~, the lines ZlZ~', Z2Z;'
intersect in E,
Exercises 103 and 104
103. In the application of article 90, triangles ABC, A'B'C' are always directly
similar if ABC is equilateral; if ABC is arbitrary, then the midpoints of its sides form
the only triangle A'B'C' directly similar to ABC.
Triangles ABC and A'B'C' are inversely similar only if BA' = AT and if the
angle at A', when conventionally oriented, is twice the Brocard angle of ABC.
[Take
circle (ABC) for unit circle and see exercise 89.]
104. Let A', B', C' be the symmetries of the vertices A, B, C of a triangle with

NON-ANTISIMILITUDE ANTIGRAPHY
120. Circular transformation.
An antigraphy is an inversely
conformal transformation.
In fact, it is the product of the symmetry with respect to Ox
and a homography (114); these two transformations are circular
(116, 76) and the first is inversely conformal (116) while the second
is directly conformal (77).
12I. Limit points.
The antigraphy with equation

z = cz + d'

c -=I=-Â°

We can establish the following properties as in article 91.
A necessary and sufficient condition for a straight line or a circle
(C) of the w plane to transform into a straight line (C') of the w' plane
is that (C) contain the limit point L of w.
The pencil of lines with vertex L is the only pencil which transforms
into a pencil of lines, and this pencil has its vertex at M'.
If r, eare the modulus and the argument of (be -
ad)Jc2, the product
I LZ.M'Z' I
has the constant value r.
The pencils (If homologous lines having
their vertices at L, M' are directly equal and the angle
(LZ, M'Z')
has the constant value e.
Remark. The angle of two axes which intersect in the limit point L
is conserved in magnitude and sense (see article 120).
122. Inversion. An involutoric antigraphy which is not an axial
symmetry (117) is an inversion whose power may be positive or negative.
According as the power is positive or negative, the circle of inversion
is the locus of the double points of the inversion or the inversion has
no double points.
The antigraphy w with equation (1) is an involution if (23) its
square w2 is the identity homography.
The equation of w2, which
results from the elimination of z' from (I) and
"

is
(cil + de)zz" -
(ail + be)z + (cli + dd)z" -

We have w2 = 1 if
cil + de = 0,
ail + be = cli + dd,
ali + ba =

and an axial symmetry if (11 7)
c = 0,
I a I = Id I,
ab + bd =

2Â° An antigraphy w is an inversion or an axial symmetry when there
exist two pairs of distinct corresponding points such that the points
of each pair correspond doubly (involutoric pairs), or when there exists
one such pair and a double point.
If there exist two involutoric pairs Zl'
Z~ and Zz,
Z~, we have
(114, 26)
(ZlZ~ZZZ;) =
(Z~ZlZ;Z2) =
(ZlZ~Z2Z;)
and the anharmonic ratio is consequently real.
The points Zl' Z~,
Zz, Z~ are therefore on a line or on a circle (28).
In the first case,

182
ANTIGRAPHY
if
ZIZ~,
Z2Z~ have the same midpoint E,
we have a symmetry
with axis perpendicular to line Z1Z2 at E; if
ZIZ~, Z2Z~ do not
have a common midpoint, there exists a point 0 on the line such that
OZI' OZ~ =
OZ2' OZ~,
and which is therefore the center of an inversion in which ZI' Z~
as well as Z2'
Z~ are homologues, and this is the only antigraphy
enjoying this property, for we know four pairs (Zl>
Z~),
(Z~, ZI),
(Z2'
Z~),
(Z~, Z2) of corresponding points. 1
If ZI'
Z~, Z2,
Z~
are concyclic, then, according as the lines
ZIZ~, Z2Z; are not or
are parallel, eLi is an inversion with center 0 == (ZIZ~, Z2Z;) or the
symmetry whose axis is the diameter perpendicular to these lines.
Suppose, now, that there exists an involutoric pair
ZIZ~ and a
double point E, elements which determine an eLi.
If Z~ is at infinity,
eLi is the inversion with center ZI and power ZIP; if E is at infinity,
eLi is the symmetry with respect to the perpendicular bisector of seg-
ment
ZIZ~,
When Zl>
Z~, E are collinear and in the finite part
of the plane, then, according as E is or is not the midpoint of
ZIZ~,
eLi is the symmetry with respect to the perpendicular to
ZIZ~ at
E or the inversion in the circle having for diameter the segment
EF, where
(EFZIZ~) = -
1.
When ZI'
Z~, E are not collinear,
eLi is, according as E is or is not on the perpendicular bisector of
ZIZ~, the symmetry with respect to this line or the inversion having
for center 0 the point of intersection of line
ZIZ~ with the tangent
at E to the circle
EZIZ~ and for power OP.
3Â° A non-involutoric antigraphy cannot have both an involutoric pair
and a double point (corollary 20).
It can have one and only one involutoric pair.
To obtain such an antigraphy, it is sufficient to determine it by
three pairs (ZI'
Z~),
(Z~, ZI), (Z2'
Z~)
of corresponding points
for which ZI' Z~, Z2' Z; are neither collinear nor concyclic.
4Â° A non-involutoric antisimilitude cannot possess an involutoric pair
(117, 4Â°), for it has a double point at infinity.
123. Non-involutoric antigraphies.
A non-involutoric anti-
graphy
eLi is called hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic according as it

F,
or an involutoric pair P, Q.
Theorem. w is hyperbolic if the homography w2 is hyperbolic but
not a Mobius involution,. parabolic if w2 is parabolic,. elliptic if w2
is elliptic or a Mobius involution.
w2 is never loxodromic.
The homography w2, not being the identity since w is not in-
volutoric, possesses two distinct or coincident double points (82,
83, 92) X and Y.
A double point of wis necessarily double for W2â€¢
But if wpossesses
an involutoric pair PQ, the homologues of P, Q in w2 are P, Q.
Therefore the points X, Yare double for w or else constitute, when
they are distinct, the involutoric pair of w.
Moreover we know
(122, corollary 30) that the existence of such a pair excludes the
existence of a double point.
The points X, Yare the images of the roots of the equation
(ea + di)Z2 -
(aa + be -
eb -
dd)z -
(ah + bd) = 0
(11)
obtained by setting z"
= z in (5).
The discriminant of (11),
6. = (aa + be -
cb -
dd)2 + 4(ea + de) (ab + bd),
(12)
is easily written as
6. = (aa + be + eb + dd)2 -
4(ad -
be) (ad -
bi),
and consequently is real for any w.
The invariant (94, 92) of w2 being
,\ =
aa + be + cb + dd + V""LS
aa + be + eb + dd - V 6.
is the quotient of two real or two conjugate imaginary numbers.
It is therefore a real or an imaginary number with unit modulus.
Therefore w2 is never loxodromic.
1Â° w2 is a direct similitude if, considering its equation (5), we have
(81)
ea + de = O.
This relation implies (122)
aa= dd
and expression (12) becomes
6. =
(be -
eb)2.
(15)

184
We do not have
ANTIGRAPHY
be = eli,
for this equation, along with (15), gives (7), which, with (6), makes
wan inversion (122).
Since be -
eb is thus a non-zero pure imagi-
nary number, we have b. < O.
From (14) we observe that ,\ is an
imaginary eiÂ° or has the value -
1 ; w2 is consequently a rotation
or a symmetry with center X, that is, an elliptic homography or an
involution.
As for w, it necessarily has X and the point at infinity
Y for involutoric pairs, for, not being an antisimilitude, it is unable
to have the double point Y; its limit points are coincident at X.
2Â° Suppose, now, that w2 possesses two limit points L2, M~.
The
limit points L, M' of ware distinct.
Since L 2, M~ are, respectively,
the homologue of L in w-I and the homologue of M' in w, we have
__ (L

L

w
-

M~ L'

.
Therefore w gives (114, 30)
(L2M'Loo) =
(LM~ooM')
or (26)
(L2M'Loo) =
(M~LM' 00).
This equation shows that Land M' correspond doubly in an anti-
graphy having L 2, M~ for corresponding points.
It follows that
(117, 4Â° and 30) L 2, M~ are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular
bisector ~ of segment LM'.
If w2 is parabolic, its unique double point X
=
Y, the midpoint
of segment L2M~ (95), is the only double point E = F of w, which
is therefore parabolic.
In the remaining cases, in order to know if X, Yare double or
are associated involutorically in w, it is sufficient to find out if we
have
or
(XYLoo) =
(XYooM')
(16)
(XYLoo) =
(YXooM').
(17)
If w2 is hyperbolic but is not a Mobius involution, X, Yare on
the line L2M~ and symmetric with respect to ~ (96).
This sym-
metry gives us
(XYLoo) =
(YXM'00) = (XYooM'),
that is to say, relation (16), and w is hyperbolic.

124. ELLIPTIC ANTIGRAPHY
185
If lij2 is elliptic, X, Yare on ~ (97).
This is also the case when
<.02 is a Mobius involution, for (101) L 2, M~ coincide on ~ and
the double points X, Yare located on the interior bisector of the
angle formed by the lines which join L 2 to two conjugate points
L, M'.
The symmetry with respect to ~ gives
(XYLoo) =
(XYM'00) =
(YXooM'),
that is to say, equation (17), and cij is elliptic.
Corollary.
cij is parabolic, hyperbolic, or elliptic according as
~
of expression (12) or (13) is zero, positive, or negative.
If ~ = 0, we have,\ = I and cij2 is parabolic (94).
If ~ > 0, ,\ is real and cij2 is non-involutoric hyperbolic because
,\ = -
I implies ail + be + co + dJ = Â°and (13) gives
~ = -4(ad-bc) (ad-be) < o.
If ~ < 0, ,\ is -
1 or eiO ::f= I and cij2 is elliptic or involutoric.
124. Elliptic antigraphy.
The limit points L, M' may
be
coincident or distinct (123).
Theorem I.
If L == M',
the antigraphy is the product of an
inversion and a rotation having common center L.
For the origin of axes at L, equation (4) of article 121 is
z'
= .!- eiO
Ii
'
and we must assume eiÂ° ::f= Â± 1, otherwise we have an inversion (19).
Theorem II.
If L ::f= M', the involutoric pair PO is on the per-
pendicular bisector of segment LM' (123).
For any two corresponding points Z, Z', we have the following relations
between segments or angles:
I PZ I I PZ' I I PL I
QZ
.
QZ'
=
QL
'
(ZP, ZQ) -
(Z'P, Z'Q) =
(LP, LQ).
These follow (25) from the equation
(PQLZ) = (QPooZ')
or
(PQLZ) = (PQZ'00).

186
ANTIGRAPHY
125. Hyperbolic antigraphy.
The double points E, F are sym-
metric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of the segment LM'
of the limit points (123).
For any two corresponding points Z, Z', we have the following relations
between segments or angles:
I EZ
I . I EZ'
I -
I EL
I
FZ
"
FZ'
-
I FL
'
(ZE, ZF) + (Z'E, Z'F) =
(LE, LF).
These follow from the equation
(EFLZ) = (EFooZ')
or
(EFLZ) = (FEZ'00).
126. Symmetric points.
The symmetry with respect to a line
and the inversion are the only two involutoric antigraphies.
This
is why we also give the name symmetry to the inversion, and in
place of saying that two points are corresponding or conjugate in
an inversion of positive power, we also say that these points are
symmetric with respect to the circle of inversion.
loA necessary and sufficient condition for two anharmonic ratios
(ABCP), (ABCQ) having the same first three points to have conjugate
complex numbers for values is that the points P, Q be symmetric with
respect to the circle or the line which passes through the points A, B, C.
The condition is sufficient.
In fact, if A, B, C are on a circle,
the circle is the locus of the double points of an inversion in which
A, B, C, P correspond to A, B, C, Q ; if A, B, C are on a line, the
line is the axis of a symmetry in which A, B, C, P correspond to
A, B, C, Q, and in both cases we have (114)
(ABCP) =
(ABCQ).
The condition is necessary, for if we have the preceding equality
and if Q1 is the symmetric of P with respect to the circle or the
line ABC, we also have
(ABCP) =
(ABCQl)'
whence
(ABCQ)
(ABCQl)'
(ABCQ)
and, consequently (29), Q == Ql'

126. SYMMETRIC POINTS
187
Corollary.
The isodynamic centers W, WI of a triangle ABC are
symmetric with respect to the circumcircle.
In fact we have (32)
(ABCW) =
emf',
2Â° If two points P, Q are symmetric with respect to a line or a circle y,
and if we transform the figure by a homography or by an antigraphy,
the transforms p', Q' ofP, Q are symmetric with respect to the transform
y' of y.
If A, B, C are three points of y, we have, by 1Â°,
(ABCP) =
(ABCQ).
Let A', B', C' be the transforms of A, B, C.
When it is a question of a homography, we have
(18)
(ABCP) = (A'B'C'P'),
and, by virtue of equation (18),
(ABCQ) = (A'B'C'Q')
(A'B'C'P') =
(A'B'C'Q'),
whence the property, because of 1Â°.
In the case of an antigraphy,
(ABCP) = (A'B'C'P'),
and, by virtue of (18),
(ABCQ) =
(A'B'C'Q')
(A'B'C'P') = (A'B'C'Q').
Corollary.
A homography or an antigraphy transforms the vertices
A, B, C of a triangle into the vertices A', B', C' of an equilateral triangle
if one of the limit points of the transformation coincides with one of
the isodynamic centers W, WI of ABC.
In fact, if the homography or the antigraphy is arbitrary, the
transforms of W, WI are the isodynamic centers W', W~ of A'B'C',
for (A'B'C'W') and
(A'B'C'W~) have the values eÂ±m/', and A'B'C'
is equilateral if W' or W~ is at infinity (32, 2Â°).
In particular, an inversion of center W or WI makes A'B'C'
equilateral, for, since the inverse of the center is the point at infinity,
this center is the limit point of the inversion.

The affix w of its center Q has already been calculated in (42) and by

at infinity in the plane are sym-
metric with respect to the circle

Their homologues Q', M'
in the homography (20) are then
symmetric with respect to the Ox axis, the homologue of the circle.
But the affix of M' being -
die, since it corresponds to z infinite,
that of Q' is -
die.
The affix of Q is then obtained by replacing
z' by -
die in (20), and is

If AI' Bl> CI
are the orthogonal
projections of any point P on the sides BC, CA, AB of a triangle ABC,
we have the equality of anharmonic ratios
(ABCP) =

Let 0 be the center of the circle (0) circumscribed about triangle
ABC and let P' and
A~, B~, C~ be the symmetrics of P with respect
to (0) and the sides BC, CA, AB.

and we consequently have (100) the Mobius involution
I a = (BC, OA~, P'00),
of which the two analogous ones are

which, having two pairs in common with the preceding involution,
does not differ from it (102), and we therefore have
I

(P' 00, ~, BB~,
CC~).
From this we find
(ABCP') =
(A~B~C~oo).
The inversion in (0) and the homothety with center P and coefficient
1/2 give
(ABCP') =
(ABCP),
and hence equation (21) is established.
Corollaries. 1Â° The pedal triangle AIBICI of a point P is directly
similar to the triangle formed by the transforms A 2, B2, C2 of the
vertices of the fundamental triangle in any inversion with center P.
In fact, the inversion gives
and we therefore have
(A1B1C100) =
(A2B2C200),
which establishes the property (82).
2Â° If P', A~,
B~, C~ are the symmetries of a point P with respect
to the circumcircle (0) of ABC and with respect to the sides BC, CA,
AB, we have the Mobius involution I
I =
(P'oo,~, BB~, CC~).
This involution also possesses the pair PQ, where Q is the second
focus of the conic inscribed in triangle ABC and whose other focus is P. 2
In fact, Q is the center of circle
A~B~C~.
Since this circle is
transformed by the involution into the circle ABC, in which P, P'
are inverses, the conjugate of P in I is Q (126).

106. If an antigraphy w is such that any two of its corresponding lines are parallel

power being p, and a translation of vector LM', where M' is the second limit point.
It is parabolic with double point at the midpoint of LM' if P = -
LM"/4; hyper-
bolic with double points on LM' and symmetric with respect to this midpoint if
p > -

107. If an antigraphy has an equation all of whose coefficients are real, it is the
product of an inversion centered at a limit point and a translation parallel to the line

I. The product
of two symmetries with respect to parallel axes d l , d 2 is the translation
whose vector is twice that of the translation perpendicular to dl and
which carries d l into d 2â€¢

Take Ox parallel to dl , d2 and
let aI' a2 be the ordinates of
these lines, whose equations are
then (33)
z-z = 2ia1,
z-z = 2ia2â€¢
If Zl is the symmetric of any
point Z with respect to dl> and
Z2 is the symmetric of Zl with
respect to d2' the equations of the two symmetries are (117)
whence the equation of their product, taken in the indicated order, is
Z2 =
Z + 2i(a2 -
a1),
which proves the theorem (14).
Conversely, a given translation is, in an infinity of ways, the product
oftwo symmetries with respect to tw(' axes perpendicular to the direction of
the translation,. the first axis being chosen arbitrarily, the second is
obtained by a translation whose vector is half th.at of the given translation.
II. The product of two symmetries with respect to axes d l , d 2 which
intersect in a proper point 0 is the rotati(>n with center 0 and with
angle twice the algebraic value (d l d2) ofthe angleformed by the arbitrarily
oriented axes d l , d 2â€¢
Take the origin of the coordinate axes at 0 and let aI'
(X2 be the
angles (xdl ), (xd2).
Line dl , passing through the origin, has an
equation of the form (37)
az+dz=O

Using the same notation employed in the preceding theorem, the

Conversely, a given rotation is,
in an infinity ofways, the product
of two symmetries with respect to axes issuing from the center of the
rotation,. the first axis being chosen arbitrarily, the second is obtained
by a 1'otation whose angle is half that of the given rotation.

We thus have a homography
whose
limit
points
L,

have 2ia, 0 for affixes, and whose double points E, F have the roots of
z2-2iaz-p = 0
for affixes, that is to say,
130. Symmetry and inversion.
The product of the symmetry
with respect to a line d and the inversion of power p and center 0 not
on d is a hyperbolic, elliptic, or parabolic homography according as p
is less than, greater than, or equal to the square ofthe distance of0 from d.
If 0 is on d, the product is a Mobius involution having 0 for central
point, and whose double points are on d or on the perpendicular to d
through 0 according as the powe1' p is positive or negative.
We have similar results for the product of an inversion and a symmetry
with respect to a line.
Take Ox parallel to d and
let
a be
the ordinate of a
point of d.
The equations
of the symmetry and the in-
version being (129, 19)
ia Â± vi p_a2â€¢

131. PRODUCT OF TWO INVERSIONS
195
If a is not zero, that is, if the center Â° is not on the axis d, the
homography is not involutoric; points E, F are distinct on Oy or
d according as p is less than or greater than a2 ; E, F coincide at
the point (d, Oy) if P = a2â€¢
If a = 0, we have a Mobius involution with equation
z'z =p.
The central point is Â° and points E, F, with affixes Â± y'p, are
on Ox or Oy according as p is a positive or a negative number.
Conversely, a non-loxodromic and non-similitude homography is, in
a unique way, the product of a symmetry with respect to a line and
an inversion with center M', and, in a unique way, the product of an
inversion with center L and a symmetry with respect to a line (95,
96, 97).
The symmetry and the inversion are permutable if the homo-
graphy is a Mobius involution (101).
131. Product of two inversions.
An inversion with center Â°
and negative power p has no real double points, for its equation
z'z = p
for origin at Â°gives the double points by means of the equation
zz = p
or
x2 + y2 = P
(1)
which has no real roots.
Since equation (1) has real coefficients,
it represents an ideal circle (40), whose center Â° is real, the square
of whose radius is the negative number p, and all of whose points
are imaginary and are said to be double for the inversion.
This
ideal circle is called the circle of inversion.
By considering such
circles of inversion, we can employ properties about pencils of circles
established in analytic geometry or in projective geometry when these
pencils do not exclude the imaginaries of von Staudt.
Theorem.
The product 1211 (21) of two inversions Iv 12 having
the distinct points 01' O2 as centers,l PI' P2 for powers, and 1'1'
1'2 for circles of inversion is a non-loxodromic homography
OJ having
for limit points Land M' the inverses, respectively, of O 2 and 0 1
in II and 12, and for double points E and F the centers of the null circles
(the Poncelet points) or the base pf'ints of the pencil of circles to which
1'1 and 1'2 belong.

O 2, the product 121, is the homothety (0" P./p,).

PRODUCT OF SYMMETRIES
The homography w is
1Â° hyperbolic if at least one of the circles Y1' Y2 is ideal or if Y1'
Y2 are real and non-intersecting;
2Â° parabolic if Y1' Y2 are real and tangent;
3Â° elliptic if Y1' Y2 are real and intersecting;
4Â° a Mobius involution if the circles Y1' Y2 are orthogonal, one of
the circles being allowed to be ideal.
If L 1 is the inverse of L in 11' the inverse of L1 in 12 must be
at infinity.
Hence L1 =
02' and
(2)
Since 0 1 is the inverse, in 11, of the point at infinity, M' is the inverse
of 0 1 in 12, and we have
02M'.020 1= P2'
(3)
The homography w is a Mobius involution if L
=
M'.
Equation
(3) then gives
L02Â·010 2 = P2
and, by adding this to (2), we find
PI + P2 =
010~.
(4)
Since PI' P2 are the squares of the radii of Y1' Y2' these circles are
orthogonal.
Line 0 10 2 contains the homologue in w of each of its points,
and is thus a double line for w.
Hence w is non-Ioxodromic.
The
double points E, F of ware therefore on line 0 10 2 or on the per-
pendicular to 0 10 2 at the midpoint of segment LM', a fact which
will determine the hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic character of w.
If E, F are on 0102' they constitute a pair of conjugate points
in each of the inversions, for if 0lE.01E1
=
PI we must also have
02E1.02E = P2 so that E may be double for w.
It follows that
E, F will be on 0 10 2 if there exists on this line two points which
are conjugate with respect to each of the circles Y1' Y2' in other
words, if the pencil of circles determined by Y1' Y2 contains two
point circles, distinct or not; these point circles will be the points
E, F.
This will occur when at least one of the circles Y1' Y2 is ideal,

131. PRODUCT OF TWO INVERSIONS

or when Y1' Y2 are real but non-intersecting, or when Y1' Y2 are

10 If the product 1211 is a Mobius involution, the
double points E, F of the involution are on the line 0 10 2 if one of the
inversions has a negative power, and on the perpendicular to 0 10 2
at L

and conversely.
20 A necessary and sufficient condition for the product of the inversions
11, 12 to be a Mobius involution is that the inversions be permutable.
In fact, the product 1211 is an involutoric homography if (23)
(1211)2 = 1
or
12111211 = 1.
If we multiply on the right by 11, then on the left by 12, and note
that I~ = I = 12, we have
1112 = 1211>
132. Homography
obtained
as
product
of
inversions.
Theorem I.
A hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic homography is, in
a single infinity of ways, the product of two inversions whose centers are
found on the line joining the limit points of the homography.
Take any point 0 1 on the line joining the limit points L, M'
of the homography w whose double points are E, F. Let 11 be the
inversion with center 0 1 and
power PI = 0lE.01F
or 0lE2
according as w is or is not hyperbolic.
The inversion 12 having
for center the point O 2 such that 0102.01L = P1 and for power
P2
=
02E.0 2F
or 02E2 according as w is or is not hyperbolic,
is such that
1211 = w.
In fact, the homography 1211 has E, F for double points and L
for limit point (131), and is therefore w (74).
Theorem II.
There are two single infinities of ways of obtaining
a Mobius involution as a product of two inversions.
Either the centers
are on the line determined by the double points E, F, which they separate
harmonically, and each of the in-versions interchanges E and F, or the
circles of inversion intersect orthogonally at E and F (131, corollary 1Â°).
Theorem III.
Every loxodromic homography is, in an infinity of
ways, the product of four inversions.
It is, in fact, in a double infinity of ways, the product of two Mobius
involutions (110, corollary), and each of these involutions is obtained
as a product of two inversions (theorem II).
133. Antigraphy obtained as product of three symmetries.
Theorem I.
Every antigraphy w is the product of three symmetries.
10 Suppose, first of all, that w is not an antisimilitude; it then
does not have the point at infinity for a double point (116).
If

133. ANTIGRAPHY OBTAINED AS PRODUCT OF THREE SYMMETRIES
199
S designates the symmetry with respect to an arbitrarily chosen
line s, we have
w=w8,
w being a non-similitude homography since otherwise the point at
infinity would be a double point for w.
We know (110) that w
is, in an infinity of ways, the product J2J1of two Mobius involutions
which have the double points of w for pairs of conjugate points,
one of them, say J l' being able to be determined by the arbitrary
choice of a second pair of conjugate points.
Since w is not a
similitude, we can choose J1 so that its central point will be on s.
We have
w = J2J18.
But JIS is an inversion (101) II, whence
w =
J211'
Since J 2 is (132, II), in an infinity of ways, the product 1312 of two
inversions, we have
w = 131211,
2Â° If wis an antisimilitude, its transform (112) by a non-similitude
homography 8 is a non-antisimilitude antigraphy w', the product
I;I~I~ of three symmetries whose transforms by 8-1 give w as the
product of three symmetries.
Corollary.
A homography is the product of four symmetries (axial
symmetries or inversions), for it is the product of an axial symmetry
and an antigraphy.
Theorem II.
The product 131211 of three inversions having distinct
centers is an inversion 14 or a symmetry 14 with respect to a line if the
circles of inversion (II)' (1 2), (13) belong to a common pencil of circles
or are orthogonal in pairs.
The circle or the line (14) belongs to the same
pencil or is orthogonal to (II)' (12), (13)'
The equation
is equivalent to
1312= 1411
obtained by multiplying the two sides of the preceding equation
on the right by 11'
The homography w = 1312 is neither loxodromic
nor a similitude (131).

200
PRODUCT OF SYMMETRIES
If w is non-involutoric and hyperbolic, or is parabolic, the circles
(1 2), (13) define a pencil of circles having the double points E, F
of w for Poncelet points (131), and since we must have w = I4I}>
it is necessary that the circles (II)' (It) belong to this pencil.
More-
over, it is sufficient that (II) belong to this pencil in order that 14
exist (132).
If w is elliptic, a similar argument proves that (11)' (1 2), (13) must
pass through E, F, a condition which is sufficient.
If w is a Mobius involution, it is possible for the orthogonal circles
(1 2), (13) to have E, F for Poncelet points or to pass through E, F,
the first situation holding if (1 2) or (13) is ideal (131).
Similarly,
the orthogonal circles (11)' (14) belong to the same pencil as do (1 2),
(13) or are orthogonal to these circles (132, II).

cusps (a Steiner hypocycloid, or deltoid), tritangent to circle (0) at three points, one of
which is A, which are vertices of an equilateral triangle AA'A".

It can be generated

invariably fixed to PI generates the trifolium.

133. Being given the affix m of the center of a conic inscribed in a triangle ABC,
form the equation giving the affixes of the foci.
Find, in this way, the equation giving the foci of the inscribed Steiner ellipse (exer-
cise 84) in the case where the circumcircle is the unit circle.
In the same case, the affixes of the centers of the circles tangent to the sides of the
triangle are the roots of the equation
2z + S3Z' =
S"
which is equivalent to
Z4 -
2s.zÂ· + 8ssz + s: -
4s,sS = O.
134, A triangle ABC and a line which cuts the sides BC, CA, AB in A', B', C'
form a quadrilateral Q giving the Mobius involution (AN, BB', CC').
1Â° The equation of this involution is
(z -
a) (z -
a') =
A(Z -
b) (z -
b'),
where>' represents a complex parameter, and the affix of the Miquel point M is any
one of the expressions

bb'
a + a'-b-b'

2Â° A focus Z of a conic inscribed in Q being such that, for example, angles (ZA,ZB),
(ZB',ZA') are equal, show (exercise 128) that the locus of the foci of all these conics
has the equation
(z -
a) (z -
a') =
t(z -
b) (z -
b'),
where t denotes a real parameter.
This locus, called the focal locus of Van Rees, is, in general, a non-unicursal circular
cubic.
It passes through the six vertices of Q and the Miquel point, which is the
focus of the parabola of the family of conics.
3Â° The two (real) foci of anyone of the conics are given by the same value of t
(article 98).
4Â° The focal locus of Van Rees is the locus of pairs of conjugate points in a Mobius
involution.
The midpoints of the pairs of points are collinear.
5Â° The locus of the harmonic conjugate of a fixed point P with respect to the real
foci of a variable conic inscribed in a quadrilateral Q is a straight line if Q is a parallelo-
gram; otherwise it is a straight line or a circle according as P is or is not on the line
containing the midpoints of the diagonals of Q.
6Â° The harmonic conjugates of a point with respect to the three pairs of opposite
vertices of a quadrilateral lie on a straight line or a circle which passes through the
symmetric of the point with respect to the Miquel point of the quadrilateral.

135. A necessary and sufficient condition for the two pairs of real foci of two conics
inscribed in a triangle to separate one another harmonically is that the centers of the
conics be a pair of isogonal points.
[See Mathesis, 1954, pp. 218, 31\.J
136. If e is an arbitrary point in the plane ofthe Mobius involution I =
(AA',BB'),
and if D is the second point of intersection of the two circles AB'C, A'Be, then the
second point of intersection of the two circles ABD, A'B'D is the conjugate C of e
in I (STRUBECKER, Monatshefte fur Math. und Physik, vol. 41, 1934, p. 439).
[It
suffices to consider the transform 11 of I by an inversion of center e, and the central
point of 11 (article 104).J
