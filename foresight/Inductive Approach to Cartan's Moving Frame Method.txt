ABSTRACT
This thesis is devoted to algorithmic aspects of the implementation of Cartan’s moving
frame method to the problem of the equivalence of submanifolds under a Lie group action.
We adopt a general deﬁnition of a moving frame as an equivariant map from the space of
submanifolds to the group itself and introduce two algorithms, which simplify the construc-
tion of such maps. The ﬁrst algorithm is applicable when the group factors as a product
of two subgroups G = BA, allowing us to use moving frames and diﬀerential invariants
for the groups A and B in order to construct a moving frame and diﬀerential invariants
for G. This approach not only simpliﬁes the computations, but also produces the relations
among the invariants of G and its subgroups. We use the groups of the projective, the
aﬃne and the Euclidean transformations on the plane to illustrate the algorithm. We also
introduce a recursive algorithm, allowing, provided the group action satisﬁes certain condi-
tions, to construct diﬀerential invariants order by order, at each step normalizing more and
more of the group parameters, at the end obtaining a moving frame for the entire group.
The development of this algorithm has been motivated by the applications of the moving
frame method to the problems of the equivalence and symmetry of polynomials under linear
changes of variables. In the complex or real case these problems can be reduced and, in
theory, completely solved as the problem of the equivalence of submanifolds. Its solution
however involves algorithms based on the Gr¨obner basis computations, which due to their
complexity, are not always feasible. Nevertheless, some interesting new results were ob-
tained, such as a classiﬁcation of ternary cubics and their groups of symmetries, and the
necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a homogeneous polynomial in three variables to be
equivalent to xn + yn + zn.

Introduction.
Elie Cartan’s method of equivalence is a natural development of the Felix Klein
Erlangen program (1872), which describes geometry as the study of invariants of group
actions on geometric objects. Cartan formulated the problem of the equivalence of
submanifolds under a group of transformations and introduced the method of moving
frames, which allows one to construct diﬀerential invariants under a group action
[6]. The functional relations among the invariants provide a key to the classiﬁcation
of submanifolds under a prescribed group of transformations. Classically, a moving
frame is an equivariant map from the space of submanifolds (or more rigorously, from
the corresponding jet bundle) to the bundle of frames. Exterior diﬀerentiation of this
map produces an invariant coframe, which is used to construct a number of diﬀerential
invariants suﬃcient to solve the equivalence problem.
Considering moving frame
constructions on homogeneous spaces, Griﬃths [20] and Green [19] observed that a
moving frame can be viewed as an equivariant map from the space of submanifolds to
the group itself. As pointed out in [20], one of the classical moving frames, the Fr´enet
frame, is in fact a map from the space of curves to the Euclidean group. Adopting
this observation as a general deﬁnition of a moving frame, Fels and Olver [12], [13]
generalized the method for arbitrary, not necessarily transitive, ﬁnite-dimensional Lie
group actions on a manifold introducing, for the ﬁrst time, a completely algorithmic
way for their construction.
In the ﬁrst chapter we give an overview of the Cartan’s solution to the problem of
the equivalence of submanifolds. We also describe a general algorithm for construction
of the moving frames and diﬀerential invariants developed by Fels and Olver [13].
Following this method, however, one might have to prolong the action to the jet
spaces of high order before obtaining any invariants, while the earlier methods [20],
[19] allow one to construct invariants order by order. We combine the advantages of

both approaches in the recursive algorithm presented in Chapter 2. Not surprisingly,
the construction of moving frames and diﬀerential invariants is simpler when the
acting group has fewer parameters. Thus, it is desirable to use the results obtained
for a subgroup H ⊂G to construct a moving frame and diﬀerential invariants for
the entire group G. The inductive algorithm from Chapter 2 allows us to perform
this for the groups that factor as a product. Using this algorithm, one obtains at the
same time the relations among the invariants of group G and its subgroup H. An
illustrative example is induction from the Euclidean action on plane curves to the
special aﬃne action, and then to the action of the entire projective group. As a by-
product, one obtains the expression of the aﬃne invariants in terms of the Euclidean
ones and the projective invariants in terms of the aﬃne ones. The actions of all three
groups play an important role in computer image processing [10], [31].
Equipped with all of these tools we approach the problem of the equivalence and
symmetry of polynomials under linear changes of variables in Chapter 3. In fact,
applications to classical invariant theory have served as the initial motivation for
the development of the algorithms from Chapter 2. Two polynomials are said to be
equivalent if there is a linear change of variables that transforms one into the other.
The group of symmetries of a polynomial consists of all linear changes of variables that
leave the polynomial unchanged. It is desirable to describe the classes of equivalent
polynomials and classify the corresponding symmetry groups.
We concentrate on
polynomials over complex numbers although indicate how to adopt the results to
real polynomials. This problem has been traditionally approached by algebraic or
algebraic-geometry tools [18], [21], [25], [35].
Inspired by the ideas of Olver’s book [28] we approach the problem using a diﬀer-
ential geometric method of moving frames. We consider the graph of a polynomial
F(x) in m variables as a submanifold in (m + 1)-dimensional complex (or real) space
therefore reducing the question to equivalence problems for submanifolds.
In the
polynomial case, diﬀerential invariants can be chosen to be rational functions, and
the polynomial relations among them can be found via elimination algorithms based
on Gr¨obner basis computations. Hence, the problem of the equivalence and symme-
try of polynomials can be completely solved, at least in theory. In practice, however,
we are confronted with the complexity of Gr¨obner basis computations, which signif-

INTRODUCTION

icantly limits our ability to solve speciﬁc problems. We start with the simplest case
of polynomials in two variables, reproducing results from the paper by Peter Olver
and myself [2]. We provide a Maple code which determines the dimension of the
symmetry group of a given polynomial and in the case when the symmetry group
is ﬁnite, computes it explicitly. Computations become challenging, even in the next
case of polynomials in three variables. In order to construct a complete set of dif-
ferential invariants we apply the recursive algorithm from Chapter 2. In some cases,
the relations among the invariants are successfully computed via algorithms based
on Gr¨obner basis computations, while in the other cases, this computation does not
seem to be feasible. Nevertheless, some interesting new results were obtained, such as
a classiﬁcation of ternary cubics and their groups of symmetries, and necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for a homogeneous polynomial in three variables to be equivalent
to xn + yn + zn.
Cartan’s method for solving the problem of equivalence for submanifolds was
formulated in the category of smooth manifolds. Hence, its direct applicability is
restricted to polynomials over complex or real numbers. It would be a worthwhile
and interesting project to reformulate the method of moving frames in the algebraic-
geometry language, so that it can be applied to the problem of the equivalence and
symmetry of algebraic varieties over ﬁelds of arbitrary characteristics.

Chapter 1
The Equivalence Problem for
Submanifolds.
Two manifolds are said to be equivalent under a transformation group if one can be
mapped to the other by an element of the group. Symmetry can be considered as
self-equivalence. The group of the symmetries, or the isotropy group, of a subman-
ifold consists of the transformations which map the submanifold to itself. Given a
transformation group one would like to ﬁnd classes of equivalent manifolds and to
describe the group of symmetries of a given submanifold.
A local solution to this problem for a group acting on a homogeneous space was
presented by E. Cartan in [6] and is known as the method of moving frames. Clas-
sically, a moving frame is an equivariant map from the space of submanifolds (or
more rigorously from the corresponding jet bundle) to the bundle of frames. Exterior
diﬀerentiation of this map produces an invariant coframe, which is used to construct
a number of diﬀerential invariants suﬃcient to solve the equivalence problem.
The method of moving frames was generalized by Fels and Olver [13] for arbitrary
(not necessarily transitive) ﬁnite-dimensional Lie group actions on a manifold. It
relies on the deﬁnition of moving frame as an equivariant map from the space of
submanifolds to the group itself, which could be also found in Griﬃths [20] and
Green [19]. As pointed out by Griﬃths in [20], one of the classical moving frames,
the Fr´enet frame, is in fact a map from the space of curves to the Euclidean group.
We remark that the problem of the equivalence for submanifolds is one of many
problems which can be reformulated in terms of an exterior diﬀerential system and
reduced to a question of its integrability [4].
Other important examples include

the equivalence and symmetry problems for diﬀerential equations and for variational
functionals. Cartan’s method consists of rewriting the problem in terms of diﬀeren-
tial forms in a way that it becomes intrinsic with respect to group action. Then the
exterior diﬀerentiation of this system produces the suﬃcient number of diﬀerential
invariants. The equivalence problem can be solved by examining the functional rela-
tions among these invariants. Although not completely algorithmic this approach has
led to solving numerous equivalence problems e.g., [5], [7], [15], [23] and [26] including
problems which involve inﬁnite dimensional pseudo-groups of transformation.
In what follows we consider the local problem of equivalence and symmetry under
ﬁnite dimensional Lie group of transformation on a smooth manifold. In the ﬁrst
section we review some basic deﬁnitions and results about Lie group actions which
we will use later.
1.1
Lie Group Actions on Manifolds.
Deﬁnition 1.1.1. A smooth map w : G × M →M deﬁnes an action of a group G
on a manifold M if it satisﬁes the following properties:
w(e, z) = z,
w(a, w(b, z)) = w(ab, z),
(1.1)
for any z ∈M, a, b ∈G. When it does not lead to confusion an action will be denoted
as multiplication: w(a, z) = a · z
We adopt the deﬁnition of local group actions from [26].
Deﬁnition 1.1.2. A local group of transformations on M is given by a (local) Lie
group G and an open subset U ⊂G×M , such that {e}×M ⊂U ⊂G×M, which is
the domain of deﬁnition of the group action, and a smooth map w: U →M such that
if (g, z) ∈U the so is (g−1, w(g, z)) and two properties (1.1) are satisﬁed whenever w
is deﬁned.
The following deﬁnition extends the notion connectness to local transformations:
Deﬁnition 1.1.3. A group of transformations G acting on M is called connected if
the following requirements hold:
(i) G is a connected Lie group and M is a connected manifold;

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.
6
(ii) the domain U ⊂G × M of the group action is connected;
(iii) for each z ∈M the local group Gz = {g ∈G|(g, z) ∈U} is connected.
Deﬁnition 1.1.4. The orbit Oz through a point z ∈M is the image of the map
wz : G →M given by wz(g) = w(g, z). Each point of M belongs to a unique orbit. If
there is only one orbit on M, then Oz = M for all z and the action is called transitive.
The diﬀerential dwz : TG|e →TM|z maps the Lie algebra of G to the tangent
space at the point z. Let X ∈g = TG|e then ˆX(z) = dwz(X) is a smooth vector
ﬁeld on M called an inﬁnitesimal generator of the G-action:
exp(tX) · z = exp(t ˆX, z),
where exp(t ˆX, z) is the ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld ˆX.
Deﬁnition 1.1.5. The isotropy group of a subset S ⊂M is
GS = {g ∈G|gS = S}.
The global isotropy subgroup is the subgroup
G∗
S =
\
x∈S
Gx = {g ∈G|gS = S}
consisting of those group elements which ﬁx all points in S.
Deﬁnition 1.1.6. A group G acts eﬀectively if diﬀerent elements have diﬀerent ac-
tions, or equivalently G∗
M = {e}. The action of G is locally eﬀective if G∗
M is a discrete
subgroup of G. A group G acts eﬀectively on subsets if the global isotropy subgroup
of each open subset U ⊂M is trivial.
If a group does not act eﬀectively then we can replace its action with the action
of the quotient group G/GM. This action is well deﬁned, eﬀective and essentially the
same as the action of G. Clearly if G acts eﬀectively on subsets then G acts eﬀectively.
The converse statement is true in analytic category, however as example 2.3 in [13]
shows, it is not valid in general in smooth category.
Deﬁnition 1.1.7. A transformation group acts freely if the isotropy subgroup of each
point is trivial and locally freely if the isotropy group of each point is discrete.

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.
7
If the group acts (locally) freely then the dimension of each orbit Oz is equal to
the dimension of the group. In this case the map wz deﬁnes a (local) diﬀeomorphism
between G and the orbit Oz.
An action of a Lie group G on a manifold M induces the standard linear repre-
sentation on the space of smooth functions F : M →R:
(gF)(gz) = F(z),
(1.2)
where g ∈G, z ∈M.
Deﬁnition 1.1.8. A function F(z) is invariant if it is a ﬁxed point of the standard
representation above, that is
F(gz) = F(z).
(1.3)
We say that F is a local invariant if it is deﬁned on an open subset of M, and/or the
equality (1.3) holds only for g in a neighborhood of identity in G.
Deﬁnition 1.1.9. The symmetry group GF of a function F(z) is the isotropy group
of F under representation (1.2):
GF = {g ∈G|F(gz) = F(z)}
Deﬁnition 1.1.10. The action of a group G on M is called semi-regular if all its
orbits have the same dimension. The action is called regular if, in addition, each
point z ∈M has arbitrarily small neighborhood whose intersection with each orbit is
a connected subset thereof.
Let G act semi-regularly on an m-dimensional manifold M and let s be the dimen-
sion of the orbits, then the inﬁnitesimal generators of the G-action form an integrable
distribution of the dimension s. The orbits of G are the integral manifolds for this
distribution. By Frobenius’ theorem, coordinates (x1, . . . , xs, y1, . . . , ym−s) on a chart
U ⊂M can be chosen so that each orbit is a level set of the last m −s coordinates:
yi = ci, i = 1, . . . , m−s. The functions yi form a complete set of functionally indepen-
dent local invariants. Thus the number of functionally independent local invariants
for a semi-regular action of a Lie group equals to the diﬀerence between the dimension
of the manifold and the dimension of the orbits. Let S be a level set of the ﬁrst s
coordinates xi = ci, i = 1, . . . , s, then the submanifold S has codimension s and is

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.
8
transversal to each orbit in U. Thus S intersects each orbit in a discrete set of points.
If the action is regular and U is suﬃciently small, then S intersects each orbit only
once.
Deﬁnition 1.1.11. Suppose G acts semi-regularly on an m-dimensional manifold M
with s-dimensional orbits. A (local) cross-section is an (m −s)-dimensional manifold
S ⊂M such that S intersects each orbit transversally. The cross-section is regular if
S intersects each orbit at most once.
We conclude this preliminary section with Lie’s inﬁnitesimal criterion of invari-
ance:
Theorem 1.1.12. Let G be a connected group of transformations acting on a mani-
fold M. A function I : M →R is invariant under G if and only if for every inﬁnites-
imal of generator X of the G-action:
X[I] ≡0.
Remark 1.1.13. Throughout the thesis we will, without saying it explicitly, consider
the group actions, cross-sections and invariants to be local. Nevertheless in order to
shorten the statements and formulas we will keep global notation. For instance we
will write w : G × M →M instead of w: U →M for a local action, or we will call S
a regular cross-section on M meaning that it is a regular cross-section in some open
subset U ⊂M.
1.2
Jet Spaces and Diﬀerential Invariants.
In the case when the group G acts transitively on M, there are clearly no non-
constant invariants. Nevertheless if we consider the transitive action of the group
of Euclidean motions on the plane we can ﬁnd important geometric invariant: the
curvature κ =
uxx
√
1+u2x
3 of an embedded curve u = u(x). We notice that κ depends
not only on a point on the curve but also on the derivatives of u with respect to x.
This is an example of a diﬀerential invariant, which is an ordinary invariant function
on the prolonged space (or jet space). Diﬀerential invariants were used by Lie in his
work on the symmetry reduction of diﬀerential equations. The formal deﬁnition of

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.
9
jet spaces was ﬁrst given by Ehresmann. We are going to give a brief description of
the geometric structure of jet spaces, for more details see [1], [26], [27].
Deﬁnition 1.2.1. Given a smooth manifold M of dimension m and an integer p < m,
the k-th order jet bundle Jk = Jk(M, p) is a ﬁber bundle over M, such that a ﬁber over
a point z ∈M consists of the set of equivalence classes of p-dimensional submanifolds
of M with k-th order contact at z. In particular J0 = M.
Remark 1.2.2. In the case when M has itself a ﬁber bundle structure M →B
with a p-dimensional base, then its k-th jet bundle JkM can be deﬁned by sections
s: B →M under the equivalence relations of k-th order contact at z ∈M. Then the
jet bundle Jk = Jk(M, p) from Deﬁnition 1.2.1 can be called the extended jet bundle,
since it also includes jets of p-dimensional submanifolds of M that are not transversal
to the ﬁbers over B. The ﬁber bundle JkM →M is an open dense subset of the
extended bundle Jk(M, p).
There is a natural projection πk
l : Jk →Jl. The inverse sequence of topological
spaces (Jk, πl
k) determine an inverse limit space J∞= J∞(M, p) together with pro-
jection maps π∞
k : J∞→Jk. The space J∞is called inﬁnite jet bundle over M. In
the same manner the tangent bundle TJ∞can be deﬁned as the inverse limit of topo-
logical spaces TJk under the projections (πk
l )∗= dπk
l . For l < k we identify functions
and diﬀerential forms on Jl with functions and forms on Jk under the pull-back (πk
l )∗.
The smooth functions and forms on J∞are deﬁned as the direct limit of the space of
smooth functions and forms on on Jk.
Let U be a chart of M with coordinates (x1, . . . xp, u1, . . . , uq) so that p + q =
dim M. We say that a submanifold S ⊂M is transverse with respect to this co-
ordinates if the restriction of the forms dx1, . . . , dxp to S is a coframe on S. Any
transverse submanifold can be locally described as a graph uα = f α(x), α = 1, . . . , q.
Let U 0 ⊂U be a union of transverse submanifolds of U and U k ⊂Jk be a subset such
that πk
0(U k) = U 0. It is not diﬃcult to see that U k is an open subset of Jk, which can
be parameterized by the set of independent variables {x1, ..., xp}, the set {u1, ..., uq}
of dependent variables and coordinates uα
J which correspond to the derivatives of
the dependent variables with respect to the independent ones, where the subscript
J = (j1, . . . , jp) is a multi-index, such that |J| = j1 + · · · + jp ≤k, ji ≥0.

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.
10
Deﬁnition 1.2.3. Let S be a p-dimensional submanifold of M, then its k-th prolon-
gation jk(S) is a p-dimensional submanifold of Jk(M, p), deﬁned by the k-th jets of
S. In local coordinates on an open set U k it is the graph of equations
uα = f α(x),
uα
J =
∂kf α
∂j1x1 . . . ∂jpxp,
where α = 1, . . . , q and J = (j1, . . . , jp) are all possible multi-indices, such that
|J| ≤k.
Although the k-th prolongation jk(S) of S is a p-dimensional submanifold of
Jk(M, p), not every p-dimensional submanifold of Jk(p, M) is the prolongation of a
submanifold in M. The exterior diﬀerential forms which are identically zero when
restricted to the prolongation jk(S) of any submanifold S ⊂M for all k form a
diﬀerential ideal on J∞, called the contact ideal. In local coordinates a basis for the
contact ideal can be written as:
θα
J = duα
J −
p
X
i=1
uα
J,idxi,
α = 1, ..., q,
|J| ≥0.
Thus the cotangent bundle on J∞(U, p) splits into two sub-bundles: the horizontal
sub-bundle which is spanned by the forms dx1, ..., dxp, and the vertical sub-bundle
spanned by the contact forms. We emphasize that the contact (vertical) sub-bundle
has intrinsic deﬁnition, independent of the choice of coordinates, whence the choice
of basic horizontal one-forms depends on the choice of independent coordinates.
The diﬀerential d on J∞also splits into horizontal and vertical components,
d = dH + dV .
The horizontal diﬀerential is deﬁned by
dHF =
p

(DiF) dxi,
where
Di = ∂

The operators Di span a subspace of total vector ﬁelds in the tangent bundle TJ∞,
which can be deﬁned intrinsically as the set of vector ﬁelds annihilated by any contact
form.

The vertical diﬀerential is deﬁned by
dV F =

∂F
∂uα
J
dθα
J.
The vector ﬁelds
∂
∂uα
J , which are annihilated by any horizontal form, span the subspace
of vertical vector ﬁelds in TJ∞.
Each one-form on J∞splits into horizontal and
vertical component, inducing a bi-grading of the exterior diﬀerential forms on J∞.
The horizontal diﬀerential dH increases the horizontal degree of a form and the vertical
diﬀerential dV increases the vertical degree. This splitting gives rise to a bicomplex of
diﬀerential forms called the variational bicomplex [34], [33], [36], and [1], an important
tool in the study of geometry of diﬀerential equations and variational problems.
Deﬁnition 1.2.4. Let X be a vector ﬁeld on M, then there is a unique vector ﬁeld
prX on J∞, called prolongation of X such that
(i) X and prX agree on functions on M,
(ii) prX preserves the contact ideal: the Lie derivative of a contact form with respect
to prX is also a contact form.
The vector ﬁeld prkX = (π∞

After we have deﬁned the jet space we would like extend the action of G on
it so that the extended action maps a prolongation of a submanifold of M to the
prolongation of its image.

When it is clear from the context that the prolonged transformation is considered
we will omit the superscript (k) over g.
Deﬁnition 1.2.6. A k-th order diﬀerential invariant on M under the action of G is
a function on Jk(M, p) which is invariant under the k-th prolongation of the group
action.
Remark 1.2.7. We consider an l-th order diﬀerential invariant for l < k as a k-th
order diﬀerential invariant under the pull-back (πk
l )∗. Thus a k-th order diﬀerential
invariant might only depend on derivatives of order strictly less than k.
If X is an inﬁnitesimal generator of G-action on M, then its k-th prolongation
(1.4) generates the corresponding prolonged transformation on Jk(M, p). From Lie’s

criterion 1.1.12 it follows that function I : Jk →R is a diﬀerential invariant if and
only if for every inﬁnitesimal of generator X of the G-action
prk(X)[I] ≡0.
Theoretically this criterion can be used to ﬁnd all diﬀerential invariants. In practice
however it is diﬃcult to use since it requires integration of a system of ﬁrst order
partial diﬀerential equation. The advantage of the method of moving frames is that
it requires only diﬀerentiation not integration.
Let Ok and Ol be the orbits of prolonged action on Jk and Jl respectively for
k > l, then (πk
l )(Ok) = Ol and hence the dimension of the orbits can only become
larger when we prolong the action to the higher jet spaces. On the other hand the
dimension of the orbits is bounded by the dimension of the group G. Hence there is
an order of prolongation n at which the maximum possible dimension is attained on
an open subset of Vn ⊂Jn. If z(k), k > n is a point in Jk such that πk
n(z(k)) ∈Vn
then the orbit of the prolonged action through z(k) also has the maximal dimension.
We call such points regular jets and denote their union in J∞as V.
Deﬁnition 1.2.8. The minimal order at which the orbits reach maximal dimension is
called the order of stabilization. The subsets Vk ⊂Jk,
k = n, . . . , ∞which consists
of the points z(k) such that the orbit through πk
nz(k) has maximal dimension are called
regular.
The following result (Ovsiannikov [30], Olver [29]) is crucial for moving frame
construction.
Theorem 1.2.9. If the action of G on M is locally eﬀective on subsets then the
prolonged action is locally free on Vk, for k ≥n, where n is the order of stabilization.
Since the dimension of the space grows with prolongation and the dimension of
orbits stabilizes at order n, then nontrivial local diﬀerential invariants are guaranteed
to appear at least at the order n + 1 by Frobenius’ theorem. Although there exists
only a ﬁnite number of functionally independent diﬀerential invariants at each order
of prolongation, their total number is inﬁnite since one can prolong up to the inﬁnite

order. Fortunately one can obtain all invariants from a ﬁnite generating set of invari-
ants by applying invariant diﬀerential operators. The latter can be constructed as
dual vector ﬁelds to horizontal contact invariant forms, which are deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 1.2.10. A diﬀerential one-form ω on Jn is called contact invariant if for
every g ∈G we have
 g(n)∗ω = ω + θg for some contact form θg. A set of p lin-
early independent horizontal contact invariant forms {ω1, ..., ωp} is called a horizontal
contact invariant coframe.
The freeness of the group action on Vn ⊂Jn guarantees the existence of a contact
invariant coframe ω1, . . . , ωp on Vn [11], [30]. The horizontal diﬀerential of a function
F can be written in terms of this coframe as:
dHF =
p
X
i=1
(DiF) ωi,
where the total vector ﬁelds Di have an important property: they commute with the
prolonged action of G and thus map diﬀerential invariants to higher order diﬀerential
invariants.
Operators which possess this property are called invariant diﬀerential
operators. The following theorem [30], [13] asserts that one can produce all diﬀerential
invariants by applying a ﬁnite set of invariant diﬀerential operators to a ﬁnite set of
generating invariants.
Theorem 1.2.11. Suppose that G is a transformation group and let n be its order of
stabilization. Then, in a neighborhood of any regular jet z(n) ∈Vn, there exists a con-
tact invariant horizontal coframe {ω1, ..., ωp}, and corresponding invariant diﬀerential
operators D1, ..., Dp. Moreover, there exists a generating system of diﬀerential invari-
ants I1, ..., Il, of order at most n + 1, such that, locally, every diﬀerential invariant
can written as a function of I1, ..., Il and their invariant derivatives:
I = H(. . . , DJIj, . . . ),
(1.5)
where DJ is a certain composition of invariant diﬀerential operators.
Example 1.2.12. Let us consider the special Euclidean group SE(2, R) = SO(2, R)⋉
R2 acting on curves in R2. The group acts freely and transitively on the ﬁrst jet space
J1 and thus the lowest order invariant, the Euclidean curvature

form, inﬁnitesimal arc-length:

Higher order diﬀerential invariants can be obtained by taking the derivatives of κ
with respect to the arc-length, or in other words by applying invariant diﬀerential
operator

1+u2x Dx. From dimensional consideration it is clear that only one new
functionally independent invariant appears at each order of prolongation, and thus
any diﬀerential invariant is a function of κ, κs = dκ
ds, κss = dκs
ds , etc.
The generalized method of moving frame [13] described in Section 1.4 provides
a consisting algorithm of constructing diﬀerential invariants, a contact invariant
coframe, invariant diﬀerential operators and recursion formulas (1.5). In the next
section we explain the role played by diﬀerential invariants in the solution of the
equivalence and symmetry problems for submanifolds.
1.3
Equivalence and Symmetry of Submanifolds.
Signature Manifolds.
Deﬁnition 1.3.1. Let G be a group acting on a manifold M. Two submanifolds S
and ¯S of dimension p in M are said to be locally equivalent if there exist a point
z ∈M and an element g ∈G such that ¯S = g · S in a neighborhood of the point
g · z ∈¯S. An element g ∈G is a local symmetry of S if S = g · S at least in a
neighborhood of the point g · x ∈S.
Both the equivalence and the symmetry problems can be solved by the following
construction. Let n be the order of stabilization as in deﬁnition 1.2.8, then the group
acts locally freely on Vn ∈Jn(M, p) and the diﬀerential invariants must appear at
least on Jn+1. Let {I1, ...INk} be a complete set of k-th order diﬀerential invariants
for k > n, where by complete set we mean that any other invariant of order k is
a function of {I1, ...INk}.
Let {˜I1, ...˜INk} be the restriction of I’s to jk(S).
The
functions {˜I1, ...˜INk} deﬁne a map φk : S →RNk. Let tk = rank(φk), then tk ≤p
since dim S = p. It is not diﬃcult to see that the rank tk does not depend on a choice
of a complete system of invariants.

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.
16
Deﬁnition 1.3.2. A submanifold S ⊂M is called regular if jn(S) ⊂Vn and the rank
tk, k ≥l does not vary on S.
Deﬁnition 1.3.3. Let S be a regular submanifold of M then its k-th order signature
manifold Ck(S) is an immersed submanifold Im(φk) ⊂RNk, where φk is deﬁned as
above.
Taking into account Remark 1.2.7 we observe that tn+1 ≤tn+2 ≤· · · ≤tn+i... ≤p
and hence this sequence stabilizes. In fact once ts = ts+1 for some s, all the subsequent
ranks are equal.
Proposition 1.3.4. If ts = ts+1 in the sequence of ranks above then: ts = ts+1 =
ts+2 = . . .
Proof. Given that ts = ts+1, we need to prove that ts+1 = ts+2. Let I be any
invariant of order s+2, then from theorem 1.2.11 it follows that there exist invariants
I1, ..., IN of order s + 1 such that I = H(Di1I1, . . . DiNIN), where H is some function.
From the deﬁnition of total vector ﬁelds it follows that:
˜I = H

Di1 ˜I1, . . . , DiN ˜IN

,
(1.6)
where ˜I, ˜I1, ..., ˜IN are restrictions of I’s to the jet js+2(S). On the other hand since
ts+1 = ts there exist s order invariants F1, . . . Ft such that each ˜Ii can be written as
a function of the restrictions ˜F1, . . . ˜Ft of F’s to js(S):
˜Ii = Hi( ˜F1, . . . ˜Ft).
(1.7)
By substitution of (1.7) in (1.6) we obtain that
˜I = H

Di1(H1( ˜F1, . . . , ˜Ft)), . . . , DiN(HN( ˜F1, . . . , ˜Ft))

.
(1.8)
We note that Dij(Hj( ˜F1, . . . , ˜Ft)), j = 1, . . . , N are diﬀerential invariants of order
s + 1 and thus any s + 2 order invariant restricted to js+2(S) can be written as a
function of the invariants of order s + 1 restricted to js+1(S).
Deﬁnition 1.3.5. The minimal order s such that ts = ts+1 is called diﬀerential
invariant order of S and the corresponding rank t = ts is called diﬀerential invariant
rank of S.

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.

Remark 1.3.6. From Proposition 1.3.4 it follows that tn < tn+1 < . . . < ts = ts+1 ≤p
and thus s ≤n + p, where n is the order of stabilization.
From Proposition 1.3.4 and recurrence formulas (1.5) it follows that the signa-
ture manifold Cs+1(S) encodes all functional relations among invariants restricted to
j∞(S). Remark 1.4.6 in the next section gives a geometric description of the signa-
ture manifold. As the following two theorems [27], [13] show, the signature manifold
of order s + 1 plays a crucial role in the solution of the equivalence and symmetry
problems for submanifolds .
Theorem 1.3.7. Let S, ¯S ∈M be two regular p-dimensional submanifolds. Then S
and ¯S are (locally) equivalent, ¯S = gS if and only if they have the same diﬀerential
order s and their signature manifolds (locally) coincide: Cs+1(S) = Cs+1( ¯S)
Theorem 1.3.8. Let S ⊂M be a regular p-dimensional submanifold of diﬀerential
invariant rank t with respect to the transformation group G. Then its isotropy group
GS is a (p −t)-dimensional subgroup of G acting locally freely on S.
Corollary 1.3.9. A submanifold S ⊂M has a discrete symmetry group if and only
if its signature manifold has maximal dimension p.
Remark 1.3.10. The condition rank(φ) < p is closed and hence a generic submani-
fold has a discrete group of symmetries.
If the symmetry group is ﬁnite then its cardinality can be found from the following
theorem [28].
Theorem 1.3.11. Let dim Cs+1(S) = p and c ∈Cs+1(S) be a generic point. Then
the cardinality of the symmetry group is equal to the cardinality of the preimage of c
under φ: |GS| = |φ−1(c)| .
Example 1.3.12. Let us return to the problem of equivalence and symmetry of curves
in R2 under the action of the special Euclidean group SE(2, R) = SO(2, R) ⋉R2. In
this case the order of stabilization n = 1, V = J1 and so the diﬀerential order s of any
curve is not greater than two (see Remark 1.3.6). Thus the symmetry and equivalence
problem for any submanifold can be solved by considering the signature manifold pa-
rameterized by the curvature κ =

with respect to the arc-length. If κ, restricted to the jet of a curve, is constant then
the signature manifold degenerates to a point (κ, 0). The curvature is constant when
the curve is either a circle or a line. The symmetry group of a line consists of trans-
lations parallel to this line and the symmetry group of a circle consists of rotations
around the center of the circle. Both groups are one-dimensional in agreement with
Theorem 1.3.8. The curvature of a generic curve is non-constant, and thus the sig-
nature manifold is one-dimensional. Let us construct the signature manifolds for two
graphs u = sin(x) and u = cos(x), which are clearly equivalent under translation by

1.4
The Method of Moving Frames.
In this section we describe the generalization of the Cartan’s method of moving frame
by Fels and Olver [13] which provides an algorithm to construct a complete set of dif-
ferential invariants of any order as well as a contact invariant coframe ωi, i = 1, . . . , p,
corresponding invariant diﬀerential operators Di and recursion formulas (1.5).
Deﬁnition 1.4.1. Let a group G act on a smooth manifold N. A (right) moving
frame is deﬁned as an equivariant map ρ : N →G, where G acts on itself by right
multiplication. In other words the following diagram commutes:
N

Theorem 1.4.2. A local moving frame exists if and only if G acts regularly and
(locally) freely on N.
Proof. We sketch the proof of the suﬃciency of these conditions and refer the
reader to Theorem 4.4 in [13] for the proof of their necessity.
Construction of a
moving frame is equivalent to choosing a regular cross-section (see Deﬁnition 1.1.11).
If an r-dimensional Lie group G acts regularly and locally freely on M then in a
neighborhood U of every point z ∈N there exists a cross-section S that intersects
each orbit at a unique point. We deﬁne a map ρ : U →G by the condition
ρ(z) · z ∈S.
If G acts freely on U then the map ρ(z) ∈G is well deﬁned, if G acts locally freely
then the map on a neighborhood of the identity Ve ⊂G is well deﬁned. To show that
ρ is equivariant we observe that ρ(gz) · gz = ρ(z) · z for all g ∈G and so since the
action of Ve ⊂G is free then ρ(gz) = ρ(z)g−1. In the future we will adopt global
notation for local objects and maps (see Remark 1.1.13).

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.
20
Deﬁnition 1.4.3. A moving frame on a submanifold S ⊂N is the restriction of ρ
to S.
We notice that non-constant coordinates of ρ(z) · z provide a complete set of
functionally independent local invariants on N. In fact if f(z) is any function on N
then its invariantization is deﬁned as `ιf(z) = f(ρ(z) · z). In other words the function
`ιf(z) is obtained by spreading the values of f on S along the orbits of G and thus it
is invariant.
This process can be described as normalization of invariants on B = G×N, which
are called lifted invariants. Let the map w : B →N be deﬁned by the group action,
that is w(g, z) = g · z, the map σ : N →B be deﬁned by σ(z) = (ρ(z), z) and the
map ι : N →N be deﬁned by ι(z) = ρ(z) · z, then the following diagram commutes:

We notice that the maps w and ι are G-invariant and the map σ is G-equivariant.
Let zi be the i-th coordinate function on U ⊂N, then (gz)i = w∗zi, are invariant
functions on B, under the action g(h, z) = (hg−1, g·z). Such functions are called lifted
invariants. Their normalization Ii = σ∗w∗zi include a complete set of functionally
independent invariants on N. The invariantization of an arbitrary function on N is
deﬁned by its pull-back under the map ι = ω◦σ : N →N. Indeed if f is any function
on N then `ιf = ι∗(f) = σ∗w∗f is an invariant function.
It is clear that if η is any form on N then ¯η = w∗η is an invariant form on B and
ι∗η = σ∗(¯η) is an invariant form on N. The pull back of any coframe on N under
ι produces a set of invariant one-forms of codimension r. We can complete this set
to an invariant coframe on N by pulling back a left invariant coframe on G under
ρ. However, we deﬁne invariantization of diﬀerential forms in a diﬀerent manner, for
the reasons which become apparent later. We notice that cotangent bundle on B
splits into two subspaces: the cotangent bundle to G spanned by the Maurer-Cartan
forms and the cotangent bundle to the manifold N. The diﬀerential d on B splits
accordingly d = dG + dN, leading to a well deﬁned bicomplex of diﬀerential forms

CHAPTER 1. THE EQUIVALENCE PROBLEM FOR SUBMANIFOLDS.

on B. Since the action of G on B is a product of the actions on G itself and the
action on N then the action of G on B preserves this splitting. In particular, if ¯η
is a G-invariant form on B then so are πN(¯η) and πG(¯η), where πN and πG are the
projection of the forms on B on purely manifold component and on purely group
component respectively. If η is any form on N then w∗(η) is an invariant form on B,
and so is πN w∗(η). Since σ is a G-equivariant map from N to B, then σ∗πN w∗(η) is
an invariant form on N.
Deﬁnition 1.4.4. Let η be a diﬀerential form on N, then its invariantization is
deﬁned by the formula:
`ι(η) = σ∗πN w∗(η).
(1.9)
In particular, if the forms dzi form a coframe on N then the forms `ι(dzi) =
σ∗πN w∗dzi = σ∗dN(w∗zi) form a G-invariant coframe on N. Applied to zero-forms
(functions) this deﬁnition coincide with the one which was given above. It is easy to
check that `ι is a projection operator, that is it maps any invariant form to itself.
One can apply the process of invariantization to construct diﬀerential invariants,
contact invariant forms and invariant diﬀerential operators on J∞(M, p).
Due to
theorem 1.2.9 there exists high enough order of prolongation n such that G acts
locally freely on Vn ⊂Jn(M, p). Thus there exists a local cross-section Sn and a
corresponding local moving frame ρ : Vn →G. We can extend these cross-section and

The process of invariantization can be deﬁned as in Deﬁnition 1.4.4, where the
role of dN is played by the jet diﬀerential dJ. In particular if
xi, i = 1, . . . , p,
uα
J, α = 1, . . . , q
are coordinates on J∞, then the functions
yi = w∗(xi), i = 1, . . . , p,

are lifted invariants on B∞and the functions
X i = `ι(xi), i = 1, . . . , p,
Iα
J = `ι(uα
J), α = 1, . . . , q
form a complete set of diﬀerential invariants on J∞.
Remark 1.4.5. The set of invariants {X i, . . . , X p, Iα
J , α = 1, . . . , q } is complete in
a sense that every other diﬀerential invariant can be expressed as a function of these
invariants. However exactly r of these invariants are functionally dependent on the
others.
If the cross-section Sn is chosen as a level set of r coordinates, then the
invariantization of these r coordinates produce constant functions, called phantom
invariants.
Remark 1.4.6. The k-th order signature manifold of a submanifold S (see Deﬁni-
tion 1.3.3) can be described as the image of its k-th prolongation jk(S) under the
projection ιk. Indeed, for k = n, . . . , ∞the map ιk projects Jk onto the subset Sk of
codimension r = dim G, parameterized by a complete set of functionally independent
invariants. Thus if S ⊂M is any submanifold then its k-th order signature manifold is
the projection of the k-th jet of S under ιk: Ck(S) = ιk(jk(S)) onto the cross-section
chosen to deﬁne the corresponding moving frame. The symmetry and equivalence
theorems 1.3.7, 1.3.8, 1.3.10 have a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of this
projection. For instance the dimension of the signature manifold decreases when the
jet of submanifold js+1(S) is not transversal to the prolonged orbits, and hence there
are inﬁnitesimal generators of the group action which are tangent to js+1(S). These
inﬁnitesimal generators give rise to the symmetry group of S.
Let us return now to the process of invariantization. The invariantization of the

produces an invariant coframe on J∞. We recall that jet diﬀerential dJ splits into
vertical and horizontal components, thus the diﬀerential on B∞splits into three com-
ponents d = dG + dH + dV . Deﬁnition 1.4.4 was motivated by the fact that such
invariantization preserves the contact ideal: invariantization of a contact form is a
contact form. The contact ideal is deﬁned intrinsically, while the choice of horizontal
forms depends on the choice of coordinates and is not preserved by invariantization,
that is an invariantized horizontal form might gain a vertical component. By project-
ing the invariantization of a horizontal form to its purely horizontal part we obtain a
contact invariant form. Let η be any form on J∞, then ¯η = w∗η is an invariant form
on B∞. Let πH denote the projection of a form on its purely horizontal component.
Since the action of G preserves the contact ideal then πH(w∗η) is a horizontal contact
invariant forms on B∞, and σ∗πHw∗(η) is a horizontal contact invariant form on J∞.
In particular forms
dyi = πH w∗(dxi) = dH w∗(xi), i = 1, . . . , p
form a horizontal contact invariant coframe on B∞. The dual vector ﬁelds ¯Di produce
a complete set of lifted invariant diﬀerential operators, such that vα
J,i = ¯Divα
J. The
forms
ωi = σ∗dH w∗(xi) = σ∗(dH yi), i = 1, . . . , p
(1.10)
form a horizontal contact invariant coframe on J∞. In general we can call σ∗πHw∗η
the contact invariantization of a form η on J∞. The vector ﬁelds Di dual to the
forms ωi provide a complete set of invariant diﬀerential operators. We notice that
in contrast with invariant diﬀerential operators Di on J∞, the lifted operators ¯Di
commute. The formulas which relate normalized invariants with invariants obtained
by invariant diﬀerentiation are given in ([13], section 13).
Example 1.4.7. Let us return to the special Euclidean action on the plane as de-
scribed in 1.3.12:

y = cos(α)x −sin(α)u + a,
u

v = sin(α)x + cos(α)u + b.
The lifted contact invariant form dHy = τdx, where τ = cos(α)−sin(α)ux. The lifted
invariant diﬀerential operator ¯Dx = 1
τ Dx and thus the lifted diﬀerential invariants are

We note that the lifted invariants deﬁne the prolongation of the group action: ux 7→
v1, uxx 7→v2, etc. The moving frame can be deﬁned on J1(R2, 1) by choosing a cross-
section {x = 0, u = 0, ux = 0}, and so an equivariant map J1(R2, 1) →SE(2) can
be found by solving the equations:
y

cos(α)x −sin(α)u + a = 0,

sin(α)x + cos(α)u + b = 0,

We notice that I2 = κ, the Euclidean curvature, I3 = κs = dκ
ds but I4 = κss + 3κ3,
according to recurrence formulas in [13]. As we have seen in Example 1.3.12 the ﬁrst
two invariants κ and κs are suﬃcient to solve the equivalence problem for curves in
Euclidean space.
Remark 1.4.8. The action of the special Euclidean group on J1 is locally free, how-
ever the isotropy group of each point (x, u, ux) contains one nontrivial transformation:


−1
0
2x
0
−1
2u
0
0
1

.
(1.12)
This is reﬂected in the ambiguity of normalization for α, which is deﬁned up to the
addition of πn. Thus the invariants I2, I3, . . . are local. In particular I2 = κ changes
its sign under the transformation (1.12).
We conclude this example with the discussion on how the procedure described
above corresponds to the classical deﬁnition of the Euclidean curvature. The Fr´enet
frame consists of the unit tangent T and the unit normal N attached to each point
on a curve (x, u(x)), with consistent orientation of the frame. This produces a map
ρl : J1(R2, 1) →SE(2). Indeed, the pair (T, N) deﬁnes a rotation matrix at each
point, and a point (x, u(x)) deﬁnes a translation vector at each point. This map is
equivariant with respect to the action of the group on itself by left multiplication,
and so it is called a left moving frame. The element of the Euclidean group assigned
to each point can be written in matrix form:
ρl =



1


In this example as well as in general the left moving frame is the group inverse of the
corresponding right moving frame: ρl = (ρr)−1. In matrix form the Fr´enet equations
can be written as:
(dT

their ratio produce the second order diﬀerential invariant κ.

Chapter 2
Inductive Construction of Moving
Frames.
In this chapter we present two modiﬁcations of the moving frame method which
were motivated by its practical implementation.
We call the ﬁrst modiﬁcation a
recursive construction because in contrast to the algorithm from chapter one it allows
to construct diﬀerential invariants order by order. At each step we normalize more
and more of the group parameters at the end obtaining a moving frame for the group
G.
In the next chapter we use this algorithm to construct a complete set of the
diﬀerential invariants for ternary cubics transformed by linear changes of variables.
The second modiﬁcation can be used when the group G factors as a product of
two subgroups: G = AB, such that A ∩B is discrete. In this case invariants and
moving frames for A and B can be used to construct invariants and a moving frame
for G. Such approach not only simpliﬁes the computations but also produces as a
by-product the relations among the invariants of G and its subgroups. We notice
that the group of the Euclidean motions on the plane is a factor of the group of the
special aﬃne motions. In its turn the special aﬃne motions is a factor of the group
of projective transformations on the plane. We use these groups to illustrate our
algorithm. As a consequence we obtain the aﬃne curvature in terms of the Euclidean
and the projective curvature in terms of the special aﬃne and also the relations among
corresponding diﬀerential operators.

CHAPTER 2. INDUCTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF MOVING FRAMES.

2.1
Recursive Construction of Moving Frames.
We ﬁrst sketch the main idea of the algorithm. Assume that G acts on M regularly
but not freely. We notice that if S ⊂M is a cross-section to the orbits of G and a
smooth map ρ: M →G is deﬁned by the condition ρ(z) · z ∈S for z ∈M, then the
non-constant coordinates of ρ(z) · z provide a complete set of zero order invariants.
However in order to build a moving frame recursively we require that S satisﬁes a
certain condition, namely each point of S has the same isotropy group. We postpone
the discussion of the existence of such a cross-section until later and assume that
H1 is the isotropy group of each point in S. In this case the map ρ0 deﬁned by the
condition ρ0(z) · z ∈S is a G-equivariant map from M to the right cosets H1\G. We
prolong the action of G to the ﬁrst order and deﬁne the set S1 = {z(1)|π1
0(z(1)) ∈S}.
The set S1 is invariant under the action of H1 and we assume that there is a cross-
section S1
1 ⊂S1 with a constant isotropy group H2. We use this cross-section to
deﬁne a map ρ1 : S1 →H2\H1, by the condition ρ1(z(1)) · z(1) ∈S1
1.
The map
ρ1
 ρ0(z(1)) · z(1)
ρ0(z(1)) is a G-equivariant map from J1 to H2\G. The non-constant
coordinates of ρ1
 ρ0(z(1)) · z(1)
ρ0(z(1)) · z(1) provide a complete set of the ﬁrst order
invariants. We continue this process by prolonging the action of H2 to the next order,
or we may prolong by several orders at once if we wish. The algorithm terminates
at the order where the isotropy group becomes trivial. For regular jets this happens
at the order of stabilization of the group. This procedure resembles in many ways
the algorithm presented by M. Green [19] for constructing moving frames for curves
in homogeneous spaces, however taking advantage of the generalized approach by
Fels and Olver [13], we can apply our algorithm to construct a moving frame for
submanifolds of any dimension under more general (not necessarily transitive) group
actions.
Following [16] we call a cross-section with a constant isotropy group a slice.
The
obvious necessary condition for the existence of a slice in a neighborhood U of z0 ∈M
is that the isotropy groups of any two points in U are conjugate by an element of G.
There is a simple counterexample of this phenomenon ([35], Example 1,§ 7).
Example 2.1.1. Let R2 act on R2 by
x →x + au + b,
u →u

CHAPTER 2. INDUCTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF MOVING FRAMES.
29
The isotropy group of a point (x0, u0) is deﬁned by the condition au0 + b = 0. The
orbits are lines parallel to the x-axis.
All the points that lie on the same orbit
have equal isotropy groups. On the other hand the isotropy groups of two points
from diﬀerent orbits are not equal and they are not conjugate because the group is
commutative.
However, one can ﬁnd slices for many common group actions. In particular slices
exist if the group action is proper [16].
Deﬁnition 2.1.2. The action of G is called proper if the map θ : G × M →M × M
deﬁned by θ(g, z) = (g · z, z) is proper. In other words if K ⊂M × M is compact
then so is θ−1(K) ⊂G × M.
Since θ−1(z, z) = (H, z) where H is an isotropy group of z, if the action is proper,
then the isotropy group of each point is compact.
Proposition 2.1.3. Let G act regularly on a manifold M and let S be a slice. Then
the condition ρ(z) · z ∈S for z ∈M deﬁnes a map [ρ] : M →H\G which is
G-equivariant.
Proof. Let group elements g1 and g2 be such that g1 · z ∈S and g2 · z ∈S. Since
each orbit intersects the slice S at one point, then: g1 ·z = g2 ·z and so g−1
2 g1 belongs
to the isotropy group Gz of z. On the other hand since H is the isotropy group of
g2·z, then Gz = g−1
2 Hg2. Thus g−1
2 g1 ∈g−1
2 Hg2 and hence g1 ∈Hg2. We have proved
that the map [ρ] is well deﬁned.
To show the equivariance of [ρ] we need to prove that [ρ](g · z) = [ρ](z)g−1. Let
us choose q ∈[ρ](z) and ˜q ∈[ρ](g · z) By the construction of [ρ] one has
˜qg · z = q · z ∈S.
It follows that q−1˜qg ∈Gz = q−1Hq, or equivalently
˜q ∈Hqg−1.
Since [ρ](z) = Hq and [ρ](gz) = H˜q we have proved that [ρ](g · z) = [ρ](z)g−1.
We can extend [ρ] to a G-equivariant map on Jk by [ρ](z(k)) = [ρ]
 πk
0(z(k))

.
Locally we can choose a section s: H\G →G, such that s[H] = e and deﬁne the map
ρs = s ◦[ρ] : Jk(M, p) →G.
(2.1)

CHAPTER 2. INDUCTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF MOVING FRAMES.
30
The map ρs is not G-equivariant, but it is G-equivariant up to the left action of H,
and so the functions f
 ρs(z(k)) · z(k))

, where f is any function on Jk are invariant
up to the left action of H.
Proposition 2.1.4. There exists element h ∈H such that
ρs(g · z(k)) = hρs(z(k))g−1.
Proof. Since [ρ] is a G-equivariant map from Jk to H\G then
ρs(g · z(k)) = s[ρ(g · z(k))] = s[ρ(z(k))g−1] = s[Hρs(z(k))g−1] ∈Hρs(z(k))g−1.
Thus there exists h ∈H such that ρs(g · z(k)) = hρs(z(k))g−1.
Let Sk = {z(k)|πk
0(z(k)) ∈S} be the subset of Jk which projects to S. In other
words the set Sk is a pull-back of the ﬁber bundle Jk →M under the inclusion
S →M. By construction Sk is invariant under the prolongation of the H-action.
Let the map w : Bk →Jk be deﬁned by the prolonged group action, that is
w(g, z(k)) = g · z(k), the map σ0 : Jk →Bk be deﬁned by σ0(z(k)) = (ρs(z(k)), z(k)) and
the map ι0 : Jk →Jk be deﬁned by ι0(z(k)) = ρs(z(k)) · z(k) for k = n, . . . , ∞, then we
obtain a commutative diagram similar to the one in Section 1.4 of Chapter 1:

If f is any function on Jk then due to the proposition above the function ι∗
0(f)
is invariant under G up to an element of H. We note that ι0 projects Jk to Sk and
thus non-constant coordinates of ι0(z(k)), restricted to Sk are transformed exactly in
the same way as coordinate functions on Sk. More generally if f is any function on
Jk then ι∗
0(f) restricted to Sk equals to f restricted to Sk and so as functions on Sk
they are transformed exactly in the same way. This trivial observation is used in both
algorithms and so we state it as a proposition.

CHAPTER 2. INDUCTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF MOVING FRAMES.

Proposition 2.1.5. Assume that S ⊂N be a submanifold of N invariant under the
action of the group H and there is a smooth projection ι : N →S, that is ι(z) ∈S for
any point z ∈N and ι(˜z) = ˜z for any point ˜z ∈S. Let f(z) be function on N and let
˜f be its restriction to S. We deﬁne a function F(z) by the formula F(z) = f (ι(z))
and denote its restriction to S as ˜F. Then ˜F = ˜f and hence h · ˜F = h · ˜f for all
h ∈H.
Remark 2.1.6. Note that the proposition above does not assert that h · F = h · f on
N, or equivalently, in general f (ι(h · z)) ̸= f(h · z).
The following proposition asserts that Sn ∩Vn ̸= ∅and hence one can construct
a moving frame:
ρH : Sn →H.
(2.2)
Proposition 2.1.7. Assume that S is a cross-section for an action of a group G
on a manifold M.
Let n be the order of stabilization, Vn be the regular set and
Sn = {z(n)|πn
0 (z(n)) ∈S} ⊂Jn(M, p), then Sn ∩Vn ̸= ∅.
Proof. The statement Sn ∩Vn = ∅implies that πn
0 (Vn) ∩S = ∅, that is there are
no p-dimensional submanifolds of M passing through any point z ∈S such that its
n-th prolongation jn(S) at z belongs to Vn. But this means that for any g ∈G, there
are no submanifolds through the point g · z that give rise to a regular n-th jet. Thus
{G · S} ∩πn
0 (Vn) = ∅. The set G · S is an open subset of M and hence we arrive to
a contradiction with the assertion that the set Vn is dense in Jn if the action of G
[30].
Remark 2.1.8. Although the map ρH : Sn →H is H-equivariant, its extension on
Jn deﬁned by ρH
 ι0(z(n))

is not an H-equivariant map from Jn to H.
Proposition 2.1.9. The map ρG : Jn(M, p) →G deﬁned by
ρG(z(n)) = ρH
 ι0(z(n))

ρs(z(n)).
(2.3)
is G-equivariant.
Proof. We recall that ι0(z(n)) = ρs(z(n)) · z(n). From Proposition 2.1.4 we know
that for an element g ∈G there is an element h ∈H such that
ρs(g · z(n)) = hρs(z(n))g−1.

CHAPTER 2. INDUCTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF MOVING FRAMES.
32
and so
ι0(g · z(n)) = hρs(z(n)) · z(n) = h · ι0(z(n)).
Thus
ρG(g · z(n))
=
ρH
 ι0(g · z(n))

ρs(g · z(n))
=
ρH
 h · ι0(z(n))

hρs(z(n))g−1 = ρH
 ι0(z(n))

ρs(z(n))g−1.
In the last equality we have used H-equivariance of the map ρH.
Since ρG is a moving frame, then non-constant coordinates of ιG = ρG(z(n)) · z(n)
provide a complete set of n-th order diﬀerential invariants.
Let [g] denote the equivalence class of g in H\G, let UH\G be a neighborhood of
H in H\G where the local section s: H\G →G is deﬁned, and let e ∈UG ⊂G be
the preimage of UH\G under the canonical projection G →H\G. Then the following
two maps are local diﬀeomorphisms:
φ: UG × J∞→H × UH\G × J∞

Example 2.1.10. Let the special rotation group G = SO(3, R) act on M = R3\{0}×
R by rotations on the independent variables x, y, z and the trivial action on the
dependent variable u.
The action of SO(3, R) on R3 is not free. The isotropy group of every point on the
positive half of the z-axis consists of the rotations around the z-axis. On the other
hand each orbit of SO(3, R) intersects the positive half of the z-axis at the unique
point, and hence it can serve as a slice S with the isotropy group H ⋍SO(2, R)
Our ﬁrst step is to construct the map ρs : M →G such that ρs(p) · p ∈S for each
p ∈M and ρs(p0) = I for any p0 ∈S.
Each coset G\H can be represented by the product of two rotations: Rx(θ) with
respect to the x-axis and Ry(τ) with respect to the y-axis. In matrix form this can
be written as


We choose the ﬁrst rotation Rx(θ) so that it brings an arbitrary point p = (x, y, z)

It can be achieved by choosing θ = arctan(y
z), then ˜p =
Rx(θ) · p = (x, 0,

z2 + y2). We choose the rotation Ry(τ) so that it brings ˜p to the
z-axis. We take τ = arctan(

provides a zero order invariant, the radius. We note that ρs(0, 0, z) = I for z > 0 and
hence the conditions of Proposition 2.1.5 are satisﬁed.
On the next step we prolong the transformation to the ﬁrst jet bundle J1. We
consider the set S1 = {(u, x, y, z, ux, uy, uz)|x = 0, y = 0, z > 0} ⊂J1, which
projects to S and is invariant under the ﬁrst prolongation of the H action.
The
ﬁrst prolongation of the ρs(p) transforms a point (u, x, y, z, ux, uy, uz) ∈J1 to a point
(U, X, Y, Z, Ux, Uy, Uz) in S1 where

From Proposition 2.1.5 we know that functions {U, Z, Ux, Uy, Uz} are transformed on

The action of H became free on the ﬁrst jet in the example above. If it is not, we
would have to either prolong the action up to the order where it is free or to repeat
our algorithm for H acting on S1. This can be done if there is a slice S1
1 ⊂S1 with a
constant isotropy group H1 ⊂H. The following procedure describes order by order
construction of invariants under the assumption that slices exist at each order. In our
notation the superscripts refer to the order of prolongation and the subscripts refer
to the induction step.

Algorithm 2.1.11. On the zeroth step we consider the action of the group G = H0
such that there is a slice S0 ⊂M with a constant isotropy group H1. We deﬁne the
map [ρ0] : M →H1\G such that ρ0(z) · z ∈S0 and ρ0(S0) = e, where ρ0(z) is deﬁned
by a local section from H1\G to G. The non-constant coordinates of
ι0 = ρ0(z) · z,
provide a complete set of functionally independent zero order invariants. Let S0
k =
{z(k) ∈Jk|πk
0(z(k)) ∈S0} and ρ0(z(k)) = ρ0(πk
0(z(k))), then the map ι0 : Jk →Sk

deﬁned by
ι0(z(k)) = ρ0(z(k)) · z(k)
is invariant under the action of G up to an element of H1 as described in Proposi-
tion 2.1.4.
Let S1
1 ⊂S1
0 be a slice for the action of H1 on S1
0 such that the isotropy group of
each point equals H2 and let the map [ρ1] : S1
0 →H2\H1 be deﬁned by the conditions
ρ1(ι0(z(1))) · ι0(z(1)) ∈S1
1 and ρ1(S1
1) = e, where ρ1(z) is deﬁned by a local section
from H2\H1 to H1. Then the non-constant coordinates of
ι1 = ρ1
 ι0(z(1))

· ι0(z(1))
provide a complete set of functionally independent ﬁrst order invariants (this set
includes zero order invariants). Let S1
k = {z(k) ∈Jk|πk
1(z(k)) ∈S1
1} and ρ1(z(k)) =
ρ1(πk
1(z(k))) then the map ι1 : Jk →Sk
1 is deﬁned by
ι1(z(k)) = ρ1(ι0(z(k))) · ι0(z(k)).
The group product

H2 = e on S1
0, the coordinates of ι1(z(k)) are invariant and the product (2.4) is a mov-
ing frame for G. Otherwise, we have to prolong the action of H2 on S1
1 to the second
order and repeat the algorithm. In the case when Sn

is a moving frame for G. The complete set of n-th order diﬀerential invariants is given
by the non-constant coordinates of
ιn = ρn(ιn−1(z(n))) · ιn−1(z(n)).
In the next chapter we will return to this algorithm to construct a complete set
of diﬀerential invariants for ternary cubics.

A Moving Frame Construction for a Group
that Factors as a Product.
The moving frame construction is simpler for a group with a smaller number of
parameters.
Thus it is desirable to use a moving frame for a subgroup of G to
construct a moving frame for G. We say that a group G factors as a product of its
subgroups A and B if G = AB, that is for any g ∈G there are a ∈A and b ∈B such
that g = ab. We reproduce two useful statements from [16].
Theorem 2.2.1. Let G be a group, A and B are two subgroups. Then the following
conditions are equivalent:
a) the reduction of the natural action of G on G/B to A is transitive,
b) G = AB,
c) G = BA,
d) the reduction of the natural action of G on G/A to B is transitive.
Corollary 2.2.2. The reduction of the natural action of G on G/B to A is free and
transitive if and only if G = AB (or G = BA) and A ∩B = e.
Remark 2.2.3. If G = AB and A ∩B = e then for each g ∈G there are unique
elements a ∈A and b ∈B such that g = ab. In this case the manifold A × B is

diﬀeomorphic to G and we will write A × B ∽G to denote that two Lie groups are
diﬀeomorphic as manifolds but are not necessarily isomorphic as groups. In the case
when A ∩B is discrete then A × B is locally diﬀeomorphic to G.
The following theorem plays a central role in the construction of a moving frame
for a product of two groups.
Theorem 2.2.4. Let A and B act regularly on a manifold M and assume that in
a neighborhood of a point z0 the inﬁnitesimal generators of the A-action are linearly
independent from the generators of the B-action. Then locally there exists a subman-
ifold SA through the point z0, which is transverse to the orbits of the subgroup A and
is invariant under the action of the subgroup B.
Proof. Let a be the dimension of the A-orbits, b be the dimension of the B-orbits on
U and m = dim M. By Frobenius’ theorem we can locally rectify the orbits of B, that
is we can introduce coordinates {y1, . . . , yb, x1, . . . , xm−b} such that the orbits of B are
deﬁned by the equations xi = ki, i = 1, . . . , m −b, where ki are some constants. The
orbits of B are integral manifolds for the distribution { ∂
∂y1 . . .
∂
∂yb}. The functions xi
are invariant under the B-action. Let vector ﬁelds X1, . . . , Xa and Y1, . . . , Yb be a basis
for inﬁnitesimal generators of the action of A and B respectively in a neighborhood U
containing z0 . The vector ﬁelds Yi, i = 1, . . . , b and
∂
∂xj , j = 1 . . . m −b are linearly
independent by the choice of coordinates and their union forms a basis in TU. We
can choose c = m −b −a vector ﬁelds
∂
∂xj1 . . .
∂
∂xjc which are linearly independent
from X1, . . . , Xa in TU. Let SA be an integral manifold through the point z0 for the
involutive distribution ∆= {
∂
∂xj1 . . .
∂
∂xjc ,
∂
∂y1 . . .
∂
∂yb}. By construction SA is invariant
under the action of B (it is a union of the orbits of B). On the other the distribution
∆is transversal to the inﬁnitesimal generators X1, . . . , Xa of the A-action, and so is
transversal to the orbits of A.
With this result we construct a moving frame for a product of groups A and be
B as follows.
Algorithm 2.2.5. Let G = BA and let B ∩A be discrete. Since we are constructing
a local moving frame, that is a map to a neighborhood of the identity of the group
we may assume that B ∩A = e. Thus an element g ∈G can be written as a product
g = ba, a ∈A, b ∈B and G ∽B ×A in the category of smooth manifolds (but not as

groups). Let n be the order of stabilization of the G-action. Since both A and B act
freely on Vn ∈Jn and their intersection is trivial then the inﬁnitesimal generators of
the A-action and the B-action are linearly independent at each point of Vn and hence
they satisfy the conditions of Theorem 2.2.4. Thus there is a cross-section SA ⊂Vn
for the action of A which is invariant under the action of B. We use this cross-section
to construct a moving frame ρA for A. The map ιA = ρA(z(n)) · z(n) projects Vn on
the cross-section SA, which is invariant under the action of B. Moreover the action of
B on SA is locally free and hence we can choose a cross-section S ⊂SA that deﬁnes
a moving frame ρB : SA →B. We can extend ρB to a map ˜ρB : Vn →B, by the
formula
˜ρB = ρB
 ρA(z(n)) · z(n)
.
(2.5)
The map ˜ρB is A-invariant but, in contrast to ρB, it is not B-equivariant.
The cross-section S is transversal to the orbits of G and the map ρG deﬁned by
ρG(z(n)) = ˜ρB
 z(n)
ρA(z(n))
(2.6)
satisfy the condition ρG(z(n))z(n) ∈S, and hence is a moving frame for the G-action.
The maps

ρA(z(k)) · z(k)
provide a complete set of k-th order diﬀerential invariants for G.
Remark 2.2.6. We notice that the coordinates of ρA(z(k)) · z(k) are invariant under
the A-action and thus the formula above expresses the invariants of the G-action in
terms of the invariants of its subgroup A.

only deﬁned on an open subset of Jk and in neighborhoods of the identities of the
groups A, B and G. The manifolds B × A × Jk and G × Jk are diﬀeomorphic, and
this diﬀeomorphism is A-equivariant. The maps wA, wG, ˜ιA, and ιG are A-invariant,
whence the maps σA and σB are A-equivariant, with respect to the action deﬁned by:

We note that neither σA nor σB is B-equivariant, but their composition is. As was

form a horizontal contact invariant coframe on J∞.

other hand the moving frame ρA provide us with another horizontal coframe which
is contact invariant under the action of A:

B is equivalent to the replace-
ment of parameters b1, ..., bl with the corresponding coordinates of ρB(ρA(z(∞))·z(∞)).
The latter are expressed in terms of invariants of the A-action.
In many situations the following reformulation of Theorem 2.2.1 enables us to
enlarge a moving frame for a transformation group A to a moving frame for a larger
group containing A.
Theorem 2.2.7. Let O ⊂M be an orbit of G and let A be a subgroup which acts
transitively on O. Then G = HA, where H is the isotropy group of a point in O. If
in addition A acts locally freely on O then A ∩H is discrete.
Let A act regularly on M and let nA be the order of stabilization for A, then the
action of A is (locally) free on a subset VA ⊂JnA(M, p). Assume that the action of

CHAPTER 2. INDUCTIVE CONSTRUCTION OF MOVING FRAMES.
42
A can be extended to the action of a group G, containing A so that there is a point
z0 ∈VA such that the orbits of A and G through z0 coincide. If this is the case then
let H be the isotropy group of the point z0. Due to the theorem above G = HA and
A ∩H is discrete and so Algorithm 2.2.5 can be applied.
The situation is especially favorable if the action of A on the regular set VA ⊂
JnA(M, p) is transitive. In this case we can extend a moving frame for A to a moving
frame for any group G containing A. Let H be an isotropy group for a point z0 in
VA, then as above G = HA and the intersection A ∩H is ﬁnite. Moreover the point
z0 is a cross-section to the action of G which is invariant under the action of H. We
use z0 to deﬁne a moving frame ρA : JnA →A. Let n be the order of stabilization
for the H-action and let Sn
A = {z(n)|πn
0 (z(n)) = z0}. The non-constant coordinates
of ρA(z(n)) · z(n) are invariant under the action of A and, restricted to Sn
A they are
transformed by H in the same way as the coordinate functions. Since H acts locally
freely on Sn
A there is a local moving frame ρH : Sn
A →H. The map ρG : Jn →G
deﬁned by
ρG(z(n)) = ρH
 ρA(z(n)) · z(n)
ρA(z(n))

Examples:
Euclidean, Aﬃne and Projective
Actions on the Plane.
The group of the Euclidean motions on the plane is a factor of the group of the spe-
cial aﬃne motions. In its turn the group of special aﬃne motions is a factor of the
group of projective transformations on the plane. All three of these transformation
groups play an important role in the computer image processing [10], [31]. Applying
the Inductive Algorithm 2.2.5 we express projective invariants in terms of aﬃne, and
aﬃne invariants in terms of Euclidean. We also obtain the relations among the Eu-
clidean, aﬃne and projective arc-lengths and the corresponding invariant diﬀerential
operators.

Example 2.3.1. Let us use the moving frame for the special Euclidean group SE(2, R)
acting on curves in R2 obtained in Example 1.4.7 to build a moving frame for the
special aﬃne group. We recall that the moving frame for SE(2, R) has been obtained
on the ﬁrst jet space by choosing a cross-section {x = 0, u = 0, ux = 0}. The special
Euclidean group acts transitively on J1 and the ﬁrst invariant, Euclidean curvature
κ appears on the second order of prolongation. The normalization of uxxx and uxxxx
yields a third and fourth order invariants Ie
3 = κs and Ie
4 = κss + 3κ3.
The special aﬃne transformation SA(2, R) on the plane is a semi-direct product
of the special linear group SL(2, R) and translations in R2. We prolong it to the ﬁrst
jet space of curves on the plane and notice that the isotropy group B of the point
z(1)
0
= {x = 0, u = 0, ux = 0} is given by linear transformations
 τ

.
Thus SA(2, R) = B · SE(2, R) and B ∩SE(2, R) is ﬁnite. In fact B ∩SE(2, R) =
{I, −I}.
We prolong the action of B up to the fourth order:

We emphasize that the transformation formulas above are valid only on S4

on J4. We normalize the ﬁrst transformation to one and the second transformation
to zero. This corresponds to choosing a cross-section
z(4)

to the orbits of SA(2, R) on J4. Then
τ = (Ie

which we call the aﬃne curvature and denote as µ. We recall that Ie

Ie

curvature and its derivatives as follows:
µ = κ(κss + 3κ3) −5

B (x) = (τ + λux) dx equals to τ ds and
hence
dα = σ∗
B(τ ds) = (Ie

(2.9)
The form dα is called the aﬃne arc-length.
Written in the standard coordinates
dα = u1/3

provide a natural explanation for the aﬃne curve evolution equation in [31]. The
relation between invariant diﬀerential operators follows immediately:

which enables us to obtain all higher order aﬃne invariants in terms of the Euclidean

Example 2.3.2. Let us now use the moving frame for the special aﬃne group to
build a moving frame for the projective group PSL(3, R) locally acting on the plane
by the transformations:
x
7→
αx + βu + γ
δx + ϵu + ζ ;
u
7→
λx + νu + τ
δx + ϵu + ζ .
where the determinant of the corresponding matrix equals to one. The aﬃne moving
frame has been found by choosing the cross-section
z(3)
0
= {x = 0, u = 0, u1 = 0, u2 = 1, u3 = 0} ∈J3.
The isotropy group B of z(3)

for the prolonged action of PSL(3, R) consists of the
transformations:

Thus PSL(3, R) = B · SA(2, R) and B ∩SA(2, R) is ﬁnite. Let

are transformed under the action of B by exactly the same rules as coordinate func-
tions u4, u5, u6, u7. We have computed the prolongation of the action of B to the
seventh order using Maple and found that:

Chapter 3
Application to Classical Invariant
Theory.
One of the central problems of classical invariant theory is the equivalence and sym-
metry of multivariable polynomials under linear changes of variables. We concentrate
on the polynomials over complex numbers, but we will indicate how to adapt the
results to real polynomials. The standard action of the general linear group on Cm
induces a representation on the ring of polynomials C[x]:
¯F(A · x) = F(x),
(3.1)
where A ∈GL(m, C), x ∈Cm and F ∈C[x] is a polynomial in m variables. The set of
homogeneous polynomials of degree n is mapped to itself under transformation (3.1).
Thus we will always restrict our attention to homogeneous polynomials of a certain
degree, which are called forms in the classical invariant theory literature. Polynomials
of degree n in m variables form a linear space of dimension
 m+n−1
n

isomorphic to
the n-th symmetric tensor product of Cm. The coeﬃcients of polynomials can serve
as coordinates on this space and formula (3.1) induces a linear action of GL(m, C) on
the coeﬃcients. One can try to classify polynomials by computing invariants that are
certain functions H(. . . , ai1,...,im, . . . ) of the coeﬃcients, invariant under the induced
action. It turns out however that this action is not regular: not only the dimensions
of the orbits vary but also some of the orbits are not closed and hence the orbits can
not be distinguished by continuous invariants. An algebro-geometric approach to the
classiﬁcation of such orbits can be found in [25], [35]. We also note that even for the
ﬁxed number of variables the number of invariants increases when one increases the

degree of polynomials.
We can bypass these diﬃculties by considering the graph of an m-variable poly-
nomial u = F(x) as a submanifold of Cm+1 (or Rm+1).
The ﬁrst m coordinates
represent independent variables and they are transformed by the the general linear
group GL(m, C) in the standard way, the last coordinate is considered to be de-
pendent variable and the action on it is trivial. The described action is regular on
the open subset where not all of the ﬁrst m coordinates are zero. We classify the
orbits by constructing the corresponding signature manifolds, parameterized by a
certain number of diﬀerential invariants. One of the advantages of this approach is
that the set of diﬀerential invariants parameterizing the signature manifold depends
only on the number of variables, but not on the degree of polynomials.
We also
note that diﬀerential invariants restricted to the graphs of polynomials are functions
H(x, . . . , ai1,...,im, . . . ) depending on both the coeﬃcients and the variables that are
invariant under simultaneous action of the general linear group on the variables and
the coeﬃcients of polynomials. Polynomial or rational functions with such properties
were widely used in the classical invariant theory [18], [21] and were called (absolute)
covariants, whence covariants that depend on the coeﬃcients ai1,...,im only were called
(absolute) invariants The simplest example of a covariant is the polynomial F(x)
itself (see formula (3.1)). Rational absolute covariants can be obtained as the ratio of
relative covariants that are not strictly invariant but might be multiplied by a certain
power of the determinant of matrix A ∈GL(C, n):
H(A · x, . . . , A · ai1,...,im, . . . ) = (det A)k H(x, . . . , ai1,...,im, . . . ).
The exponent k is called the weight of the covariant. In the terminology of classical
invariant theory the completeness of the fundamental set of polynomial invariants
(covariants) means that any other invariant (covariant) can be expressed as a poly-
nomial function of the fundamental ones. The ﬁniteness of the fundamental set for
the actions of linear reductive groups was proved by Hilbert in 1890. This crucial
result became a turning point from classical computational approach in the invariant
theory to the modern algebraic geometry approach.
There are several classical methods to obtain a complete set of fundamental covari-
ants. Two powerful methods, known as omega process (or transvection) and symbolic
method were formulated in the second part of the last century by the German school

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.

of invariant theory led by Aronhold, Clebesh and Gordan. Both of the methods are
based on application of certain diﬀerential operators (see [28] for outline of these
methods and more historical remarks). Classical processes can be also used to obtain
joint covariants of several forms under a simultaneous linear transformation.
Despite of the enormous amount of results obtained by classical approaches many
equivalence and symmetry problems remain unsolved even for the case of polynomi-
als over the real or complex numbers. The formulation of the problem as a problem
of equivalence of submanifolds, a novel approach introduced by Olver [28], produces
new results even in the most studied case of binary forms, or homogeneous polyno-
mials in two variables. In Section 3.2 the results for binary forms from my paper
with Peter Olver [2] are reproduced and then in the next sections the same approach
is extended to ternary forms, that is homogeneous polynomials in three variables.
We note that diﬀerential invariants in the case of polynomials can be chosen to be
rational functions in the variables and the coeﬃcients and so the signature manifold
construction reduces to the problem of eliminating parameters from rational expres-
sions. This problem can be solved using Gr¨obner basis algorithms [8], [32] and [14].
Thus theoretically we can construct the signature manifold for a polynomial of any
degree in any number of variables. In practice however we are confronted with the
complexity of Gr¨obner basis computation which in many cases exhaust available com-
puter resources. This limitation signiﬁcantly aﬀects the practical implementation of
the moving frame method described below.
3.1
Symmetries and Equivalence of Polynomials.
We consider the action of the general linear group on the space of polynomials in m
variables. The standard action of the general linear group on Cm induces a represen-
tation on the ring of polynomials C[x]:
¯F(A · x) = F(x),
(3.2)
where A ∈GL(m, C), x ∈Cm and F ∈C[x]. Equivalently:
¯F(x) = F(A−1x)

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
51
Since this action preserves the grading on the ring of polynomials we can restrict it
to the homogeneous polynomials of a certain degree, which are called forms in the
classical literature.
Deﬁnition 3.1.1. A polynomial F is said to be equivalent to a polynomial ¯F if there
exists A ∈GL(m, C) such that ¯F(x) = F(Ax).
Example 3.1.2. The binary form 5x2 −2xy + 2y2 is equivalent to x2 + y2 under the
change of variables
x 7→x + y;
y 7→y −2x.
To each form we associate a unique inhomogeneous polynomial by the formula:
f(p1, . . . , pm−1) = F(p1, . . . , pm−1, 1).
We call p = {p1, . . . , pm−1} projective variables and we also refer to f(p) as a form.
We can restore the homogeneous polynomial from its inhomogeneous version by the
formula
F(x1, . . . , xm) = xn
mf
 x1
xm
, . . . , xm−1
xm

.
(3.3)
Remark 3.1.3. The formula above shows that it is important to remember the
degree n of the homogeneous form if we want to restore it from its inhomogeneous
version. For example the quartic form x2y2 + y4 and the qudratic x2 + y2 have the
same inhomogeneous version: p2 + 1.
Let A =
 B
t
s
c

∈GL(m, C), be a linear transformation, where B is an
(m −1) × (m −1) matrix, sT, t ∈Cm−1, and c is a scalar. Let ¯F(x) be the im-
age of F(x) under transformation (3.1) and let f(p) be the inhomogeneous version
of F(x), then the induced transformation of f(p) follows from formula (3.3):
(s · p + c)n ¯f
 Bp + t
s · p + c

= f(p).
(3.4)
We call the corresponding transformation of f(p) projective. The form F(x) is equiv-
alent to ¯F(x) under the transformation (3.1) if and only if f(p) is equivalent to ¯f(p)
under the corresponding projective transformation (3.4).

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
52
In the homogeneous version one can consider the graph u = F(x) of the polynomial
as a submanifold in Cm under the transformation
x 7→A · x,
u 7→u.
(3.5)
For the inhomogeneous version of the problem we consider the graph u = f(p) in Cm
under the transformation:
p 7→Bp + t
s · p + c,
u 7→(s · p + c)−n u.
(3.6)
The transformation of projective variables p in (3.6) is linear fractional:
A · p = Bp + t
s · p + c
(3.7)
Two matrices which are scalar multiples of each other, ˜A = λA, induce the same
linear fractional transformation, and so (3.7) deﬁnes an action of the projective group
PSL(m, C) = GL(m, C)/{λ I} on Cm−1. Let π: GL(m, C) 7→PSL(m, C) denote the
standard projection.
Deﬁnition 3.1.4. The symmetry group of F is the subgroup GF ⊂GL(m, C) con-
sisting of all linear transformations that map F to itself. It coincides with the group
Gf ⊂GL(m, C) which maps inhomogeneous version f of F to itself under trans-
formation (3.4). The projective symmetry group of f is the subgroup Γf = π(G) ⊂
PSL(m, C) consisting of all linear fractional transformations of p that give rise to
symmetries of f. In the real case GF ⊂GL(m, R) and Γf ⊂PSL(m, R).
Example 3.1.5. The form F(x, y) = x2+y2 is symmetric under any orthogonal map:
(x, y) 7→
 (cos(α)x + sin(α)y, −sin(α)x + cos(α)y)
(−x, −y)
The inhomogeneous version of F is f(p) = p2 + 1 and the corresponding projective
group of symmetries Γf consists of linear fractional transformations
p 7→
cos(α)p + sin(α)
−sin(α)p + cos(α)
We notice that each projective symmetry in the preceding example corresponds
to two genuine symmetries of F(x, y). In general if the form F(x) has degree n then
F(λx) = λnF(x) and so if ω is any root of unity, ωn = 1, then the diagonal matrix
ωI ∈GF, on the other hand π(ωI) = e ∈Γf and so each projective symmetry gives
rise to n genuine symmetries of the form f(p).

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
53
Proposition 3.1.6. A transformation A ∈GL(m, C) maps a form F to some scalar
multiple of itself, say µF is and only if π(A) ∈Γf.
Proof. By substitution ¯F = µF into (3.2) one obtains:
F(x) = µF(A · x) = F( n√µ A · x).
and thus ˆA = λA, where λ =
n√µ A belongs to GF, and so by deﬁnition π(A) =
π( ˆA) ∈Γf.
Remark 3.1.7. If F is mapped to µF by A then its inhomogeneous version f is
mapped to µf, that is:
f(p) = (s · p + c)n µ f
 Bp + t
s · p + c

.
(3.8)
Remark 3.1.8. The original transformation rules (3.1), (3.4) apply to forms of weight
zero. One can, more generally, consider forms of nonzero weight k, with transforma-
tion rules
F(x) = (det A)k ¯F(A · x),
f(p) = (det A)k (s · p + c)n ¯f
 Bp + t
s · p + c

.
(3.9)
If n + mk ̸= 0, then the projective symmetry group of a weight k form is the same as
that of its weight 0 counterpart. However, the full symmetry group does not have the
same cardinality, and so are not isomorphic. Indeed, let A ∈GL(m, C) be any matrix
whose associated linear fractional transformation belongs to the projective symmetry
group of F of weight 0, and let det A = ∆. Then A maps F to a scalar multiple of
itself, say µ F and so F(x) = µ F(A · x). Consequently, the scalar multiple
ˆA = λA,
where
λn+mk∆k = µ,
(3.10)
is a symmetry of the weight k form F. Therefore, when n + mk ̸= 0, each projective
symmetry gives rise to n + mk matrix symmetries.
In the exceptional case when n + mk = 0, if A ∈GL(m, C) is any symmetry,
so is any scalar multiple λA. Thus each projective symmetry gives rise to a one-
parameter family of symmetries in GL(m, C).
On the other hand, the projective
group of symmetries in this case is smaller in general than for the other weights.
Indeed, given a projective symmetry for a weight zero form, one can always ﬁnd a

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
54
matrix representative A ∈SL(m, C). Due to (3.10), this representative is a symmetry
for the exceptional weight k = −n
m if and only if the corresponding µ = 1. On the
other hand, if A ∈GL(m, C) is a symmetry for weight k = −n
m then a unimodular
matrix ∆−1
mA is a symmetry for the corresponding zero weight form.
Example 3.1.9. Let f(p) = p4 + 3p2 + 1 with n = 4, m = 2 correspond to a binary
form f(x, y) = x4 + 3x2y2 + y4. Then the projective symmetry group in the case of
weight zero (as well as for any other general weight) consists of the transformations
mapping p to p, −p, 1
p, −1
p. Any GL(2, C) representative of these projective maps is
a symmetry for the exceptional weight k = −2.
On the other hand, for the form f(p) = p4 +1 of with n = 4, m = 2 the projective
symmetries for a general weight are p, −p, 1
p, −1
p, ip, −ip, i
p, −i
p. In the exceptional
case, however, only the ﬁrst four, namely p, −p, 1
p, −1
p, are symmetries.
Deﬁnition 3.1.10. A homogeneous form is called nonsingular if its symmetry group
Gf is ﬁnite.
The index of a nonsingular form f(p) is the cardinality #Gf of its
symmetry group. The projective index of f(p) is the cardinality #Γf of its projective
symmetry group Γf = π(Gf).
Thus, for nonsingular forms, the indices are simply related by
#G = l · #Γ, where
l =



n
for complex forms of degree n,
2
for real forms of even degree,
1
for real forms of odd degree.
(3.11)
In what follows we address the problem of classiﬁcation of polynomials under
linear transformation in its inhomogeneous version (3.4). We reduce the problem to
the problem of equivalence of the graphs of polynomials under the transformation
(3.7) so we can make a full use of the results described in the previous two chapters.
Remark 3.1.11. As it has been mentioned in the introduction to this chapter the
signature manifold of the form f(p) can be parameterized by a set of rational diﬀer-
ential invariants restricted to f. Elimination of the variables p produces polynomial
relations among invariants which deﬁne the smallest variety containing the signature
manifold of f. We call this variety the signature variety and notice that it is irre-
ducible in both the real and the complex case (Proposition 6, ch. 4, § 6 in [8]). The

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
55
relations among invariants, which we obtain for a polynomial with real coeﬃcients,
are the same whether the real or complex equivalence problem is considered. The
real classiﬁcation however includes more equivalence classes! It can be explained by
the fact that the signature manifold, deﬁned by parametric equations, does not nec-
essarily ﬁll up entire signature variety (see [8]) neither in complex nor in real case.
In the real case two diﬀerent parts of the signature variety may correspond to two
diﬀerent signature manifolds of the same dimension (see Example 8.69 in [28]). In
the complex case, however, diﬀerent signature manifolds are included in diﬀerent sig-
nature varieties. Indeed assume C(f) and C( ˜f) are two signature manifolds and V is
the smallest signature variety containing them. Assume that C(f) ∩C( ˜f) ̸= ∅then f
and ˜f are locally equivalent by Theorem 1.3.7 and so they are globally equivalent (for
any analytic function local equivalence implies global). Otherwise, if C(f) ∩C( ˜f) = ∅
then in the complex case, it follows from Theorem 3, ch. 3, § 2 [8] that there is a
subvariety W ⊊V such that V −W ⊂C(f), and so C( ˜f) ⊂W. This contradicts to
the assertion that V is the minimal variety containing C( ˜f). Assume that W contains
the signature variety of C( ˜f), then dim C( ˜f) < dim C(f) since V is irreducible and
W ⊊V .
We conclude that the polynomial relations among invariants provide a solution
for the problem of equivalence over the complex numbers. In the real case, these
relations produce necessary but not suﬃcient conditions of equivalence, and so more
detailed analysis is required to complete the classiﬁcation over reals.
The symmetry groups of equivalent polynomials are related by matrix conjugation:
¯F(x) =F(Ax) =⇒G ¯F = AGFA−1.
Thus the problem of the classiﬁcation of polynomials is closely related to the prob-
lem of the classiﬁcation of their symmetry groups up to matrix conjugation. The-
orems 1.3.8, 1.3.11 of Chapter 1 provide the foundation to an algorithm which de-
termines the dimension of the symmetry group of a given polynomials and, in the
case when the cardinality of the symmetry group is ﬁnite, explicitly computes all
transformations that belong to it. We start with the simplest case of binary forms.

(3.17)
Thus the signature manifold for f(p) parameterized by J and K can be used equally
well to solve the equivalence problem as the one parameterized by I3 and I4 and we
will formulate our results in terms of the former, more traditional covariants. We
note that none of the invariants are deﬁned when H ≡0. However this happens
if and only if F(x, y) = (cx + dy)n is the n-th power of a linear form and thus is
equivalent to polynomial of one variable only. As it pointed out in chapter 10 of [28]
the generalization of this statement is true when the number of variables m ≤4. The
Hessian of a form of four and less variables is equal to zero if and only if the form
is equivalent under a linear change of variables to a form of less number of variables.
When the number of variables is greater than four the ‘if’ part of the statement is
still true, but the ‘only if’ part fails [17] for instance when
F(x1, . . . , x5) = x2
1x3 + x1x2x4 + x2
2x5.
We can now state the classiﬁcation theorem for binary forms:
Theorem 3.2.1. Let f(p) ̸≡0 correspond to a nonzero binary form of degree n. The
symmetry group of f(p) is:
a) A two-parameter group if and only if H ≡0 if and only if f(p) is equivalent to a
constant.

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
59
b) A one-parameter group if and only if H ̸≡0 and T 2 is a constant multiple of H3
if and only if f(p) is complex-equivalent to a monomial pk, with k ̸= 0, n. In
this case:
J = −
4(n −2k)2
k(n −k)(n −1),
K = −
6(n −2k)2
k(n −k)(n −1)
c) A ﬁnite group in all other cases.
Remark 3.2.2. A real binary form is complex-equivalent to a monomial if and only
if it is real-equivalent to either a real monomial ±pk or to the form ±(p2 + 1)m, the
latter only occurring in the case of even degree n = 2m.
Therefore, a binary form is nonsingular if and only if its rational covariant J is
not constant if and only if the form is not complex-equivalent to a monomial. The
next result is fundamental for our algorithm for determining the (ﬁnite) symmetry
group of a nonsingular binary form.
Theorem 3.2.3. Let f(p) correspond to a nonsingular complex binary form. Then
P = ϕ(p) is a complex analytic solution to the rational symmetry equations
J(P) = J(p),
K(P) = K(p)
(3.18)
if and only if P = (αp + β)/(γp + δ) is a linear fractional transformation belonging
to the projective symmetry group of f(p).
Thus all the solutions to the symmetry equations (3.18) are necessarily linear
fractional transformations!
As remarked above, given a projective symmetry, the
corresponding symmetry matrix A ∈GL(2, C) is uniquely determined up to multi-
plication by an n-th root of unity. Since the linear fractional transformation only
determines A up to a scalar multiple, one must substitute into the transformation
rule 3.14 for the form to unambiguously specify the symmetry matrix.
In the real case, if the degree of F is odd, n = 2m + 1, then the basic symmetry
3.2.3 holds as stated. Moreover, each real linear fractional solution to the symmetry
equations (3.18) corresponds to a unique matrix symmetry. On the other hand, if the
degree of F is even, n = 2m, then the sign of F is invariant, and a real solution to
the symmetry equations (3.18) will induce a real projective symmetry, and thereby

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
60
two real matrix symmetries of the form if and only if it preserves the sign of F. The
explicit computations for of the symmetry group of a nonsingular complex binary
form relies on Theorem 3.2.3, and hence requires solving the fundamental symmetry
equations (3.18) which can be rewritten as polynomial equations in p:
A(p)B(P) = A(P)B(p),
C(P)D(p) = C(p)D(P),
(3.19)
where:
J = T 2
H3 = A
B ,
K = U
H2 = C
D.
Polynomials A and B have no common factors, nor do C and D. Bounds on the
index or number of symmetries of a binary form can be determined without explicitly
solving the bivariate symmetry equations (3.19). The fact that f(p) is not equivalent
to a monomial implies that T 2 is a not a constant multiple of H3, and hence the
ﬁrst equation in (3.19) is nontrivial. Therefore, the projective index of f(p) is always
bounded by the degree of the ﬁrst equation in p, which in turn is bounded by 6n−12
with equality if and only if T and H have no common factors. The second bivariate
polynomial is trivial if and only if the covariant U is a constant multiple of H2.
Forms for which U = cH2 will be distinguished as belonging to the maximal discrete
symmetry class. Indeed, if T and H have no common factors and all the roots of the
ﬁrst equation are simple, then the projective index of such a form takes its maximum
possible value, namely 6n −12. On the other hand, if U is not a constant multiple
of H2, then the projective index is bounded by the degree of the second polynomial
which is at most 4n −8.
Theorem 3.2.4. Let k denote the projective index of a binary form Q of degree n
which is not complex-equivalent to a monomial. Then
k ≤
 6n −12
if U = cH2 for some constant c, or
4n −8
in all other cases.
The real case clearly admits the same bounds on the projective index, since one must
determine the number of common real solutions to (3.19), and, in the case of even
degree, whether the sign of Q is the same at each solution. Consequently, the index
of a binary form of degree n is bounded by either (6n −12)l or (4n −8)l, where l = n
in the complex case, l = 2 in the case of real forms of even degree and l = 1 for real
forms of odd degree.

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.

Since the symmetry groups of equivalent polynomials are related by matrix conju-
gation in GL(2, C), a complete list of possible projective symmetry groups is provided
by the following theorem, as presented in Blichfeldt, ([3] p. 69).
Theorem 3.2.5. Up to matrix conjugation there are ﬁve diﬀerent types of ﬁnite
subgroups of the projective group PSL(2, C):
a) The n element abelian group An is generated by the transformation p 7→ωp, where
ω is a primitive n-th root of unity.
b) The 2n element dihedral group Dn is the group obtained from An by adjoining the
transformation p 7→1/p.
c) The 12 element tetrahedral group T is the primitive group generated by the trans-
formations
σ : p 7−→−p,
τ : p 7−→i(p + 1)
p −1 ,
(3.20)
of respective orders 2 and 3.
d ) The 24 element octahedral group O is the primitive group generated by the trans-
formation τ in 3.20 along with
ι : p 7−→ip

Since the maximal number of elements in the projective symmetry group of a
form of degree n is bounded by 6n −12, then the tetrahedral group can appear as
a symmetry group only when n ≥4, the octahedral group is a possible symmetry
group only if n ≥6 and the icosahedral group is possible only if n ≥12.

Huﬀman, ([22] Theorem 4.1), provides the complete characterization of polynomials
whose symmetry groups contain one of these primitive groups.
Proposition 3.2.6. The symmetry group of a binary form F contains:
a) An icosahedral group if and only if it is equivalent to a polynomial of the one of
the two forms Φ(L12, L20) + L30Ψ(L12, L20) or Φ(eL12, eL20) + eL30Ψ(eL12, eL20).
c) An octahedral group if and only if it is equivalent to a polynomial of the one of the
two forms Φ(K6, K8) or K12Φ(K6, K8).
d) A tetrahedral group if and only if it is equivalent to a polynomial from the following
list:
Φ(K6, K8) + K12Φ(K6, K8),
Φ(K4, K6),
Φ( ¯K4, K6),
K4Φ(K6, K8) + K2
4 Φ(K6, K8),

¯K4Φ(K6, K8) + ¯K2
4 Φ(K6, K8),
K2
4 Φ( ¯K4, K6),

4 Φ(K4, K6).
Note in particular that only forms of even degree can admit a primitive symmetry
group.
Maple code was written to explicitly compute the symmetries of binary forms.
Details of the programs and some of the diﬃculties we experienced in the implemen-
tation are discussed in the appendix A. The program symm computes the fundamental
invariants J and K, determines the dimension of the symmetry group, and, in the

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
63
case of a ﬁnite symmetry group, solves the two equations 3.19 to ﬁnd explicit form
of the projective symmetries. The actual matrix symmetries are then computed by
the program matrices by substituting the linear fractional transformations in the
projective symmetry group into the form in order to determine the appropriate scalar
multiple. We now present some typical examples resulting from our computations.
Example 3.2.7. Cubic forms. All binary cubics with discrete symmetries are equiv-
alent to x3+y3, or, in inhomogeneous form, to p3+1. Therefore, the symmetry group
of a nonsingular cubic is isomorphic to the symmetry group of p3 + 1. Applying our
algorithm, we ﬁnd a complete solution to the symmetry equations 3.18 is the pro-
jective symmetry group Γ given by the six linear fractional transformations taking p
to
p,
1
p,
ωp,
ω2p,
ω
p ,
ω2
p ,
where ω = −1
2 + i
√

2 is the primitive cube root of unity. Since the covariants of any
cubic form satisfy the syzygy U = −3
2H2, all non-degenerate cubics have maximal
discrete symmetry groups of projective index 6, which equals the number of diﬀerent
permutations of the three roots. The full matrix symmetry group G of this cubic has
18 elements, since we can also multiply by a cube root of unity, and is generated by
the three matrices

.
In this case, G ≃Γ × Z3 is a Cartesian product group. In the real case, one requires
real solutions to (3.18, and hence f has (projective) index 6 if its discriminant ∆< 0,
but (projective) index 2 if ∆> 0.
The Maple code can be used to compute the explicit symmetries of other cubics.
For example, the cubic f(p) = p3 +p leads to the following six element group of linear
fractional transformations
p,
−p,
ip + 1
3p + i,
ip −1
−3p + i ,

The second and third matrices correspond, respectively, to the second and third
linear fractional transformations. Note that one must, in accordance with the general
procedure, rescale the matrices as required by the condition that f must be mapped
to itself.
Diﬃculties arise when Maple gives the solutions of equations 3.18 not
as rational functions, but involving roots of polynomials. An example is the cubic
f(p) = p3 + p + 1, which is discussed in Appendix A.
Example 3.2.8. Quartic forms. A polynomial of degree 4 has a ﬁnite symmetry
group if it is equivalent to either
p4 + µ p2 + 1,
or
p2 + 1,
where µ ̸= ±2. The former has all simple roots; the latter has a double root at ∞.
In the ﬁrst situation, the symmetry group will depend on the value of µ. For
general µ, the projective symmetry group is a dihedral group D2, generated by −p
and 1/p. When µ = 0 it becomes a dihedral group D4, generated by ip and 1/p. The
associated matrices are the obvious ones, namely

in the second.
The cases µ = ±2i
√
3 corresponds to the polynomials K4 and ¯K4 listed in 3.23
above, and so the projective symmetry group is the 12 element octahedral group O.
This case has the maximal size discrete symmetry group. The linear fractional trans-
formations are generated by −p and i (p −1)/(p + 1). These correspond to diﬀerent
matrices in each case:

The transformations and their matrices are given in the form they were computed by
Maple.
Finally, the projective symmetry group of the quartic form p2 + 1 consists of just
two elements: identity and p →−p.
Example 3.2.9. Quintic forms. For polynomials of degree 5, the projective symme-
try group is either cyclic, of type An, or dihedral, of type Dn. Some representative
examples are listed in the following table.

Example 3.2.10. Higher degree forms. At the sixth degree, we ﬁrst encounter a
polynomial with an octahedral projective symmetry group: the sextic Q(p) = p5 + p
which corresponds to the form Q(x, y) = x5y + xy5, compare with (3.23). The inho-
mogeneous form looks like the the second quintic polynomial listed in the preceding
table, but we are now considering it as a sextic with an additional root at ∞, and so
the symmetry group is quite diﬀerent. Initially Maple produces symmetries which
involve square roots and so do not initially look like linear fractional transformations.
However, after some simpliﬁcations under the radical we obtain the group of linear
fractional transformations generated by
i p,

3.3
Diﬀerential Invariants for Ternary Forms.
In this section we derive a fundamental set of diﬀerential invariants for the projective
action (3.4) on the inhomogeneous version f(p, q) of a ternary form F(x, y, z). Let
us consider the corresponding (local) action of GL(3, C) on the graph of polynomial
u = f(p, q):
p
7→
P = αp + βq + γ
δp + ϵq + ζ ;
q
7→
Q = λp + νq + τ
δp + ϵq + ζ ;
(3.24)
u
7→
v = (δp + ϵq + ζ)−nu
The direct construction of the moving frame is computationally diﬃcult so we apply
the recursive algorithm 2.1.11 from Chapter 2.
Remark 3.3.1. If Gr¨obner basis computation were more feasible in practice the
following lengthy derivation of moving frames and diﬀerential invariants would not
be necessary.
In theory, the signature manifold could be derived from the lifted
invariants vk,l, obtained by the prolongation of the action (3.24). Indeed, restricted
to the graph of a polynomial, lifted invariants vk,l are some rational functions of the
group parameters and variables p and q. The action (3.24) if locally free and transitive
on J3 and we can choose a cross-section
S = {p = q = 0, u = 1, u1,0 = u0,1 = u2,0 = u0,2 = 0, u3,0 = u0,3 = 1}.
Using an algorithm based on Gr¨obner basis computations (see [8], Theorem 2, § 3,
ch. 3) we can eliminate group parameters and variables p and q from the equations:
P = Q = 0, v = 1, v1,0 = v0,1 = v2,0 = v0,2 = 0, v3,0 = v0,3 = 1,
I1,1 = v1,1, I2,1 = v2,1, I1,2 = v1,2, Ik,l = vk,l,
where 3 < k+l < s+1 and s is the diﬀerential invariant order of the polynomial deﬁned
in Chapter 1, Deﬁnition 1.3.5. As the result we obtain polynomial relations among Ik,l
that generate a prime ideal. The corresponding irreducible signature variety contains
the signature manifold for the graph of the polynomials (see Remark 3.1.11). This
procedure can be easily generalized for an arbitrarily algebraic action on polynomials.

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
67
In practice however we were not able to carry out this straightforward algorithm
and so we start the recursion by choosing a cross-section S0 = {p = 0, q = 0, u = 1}
to the local action (3.24) of GL(3, C) on C3 The isotropy group H1 of S0 consists of
matrices:

is locally free and transitive and thus G = H1T. The prolongation of the T-action:
p 7→p + t1

,
q 7→q + t2
c

u 7→c−nu
to Jk is given by the formulas
uk,l 7→ck+l−nuk,l,
(3.25)
where the variable uk,l correspond to the derivative
∂k+lu
∂kp∂lq. The condition {p = 0, q =
0, u = 1} normalizes the group parameters of T:
t1 = −p,
t2 = −q,
c = u1/n.
The set S∞

such that π∞
0 (S∞
0 ) = S0 is parameterized by functions Uk,l = u

uk,l
obtained from (3.25) by substitution of the normalization for c. The group H1 acts
on the functions Uk,l restricted to S∞
0
in the same manner as on the corresponding
coordinate functions. We note that the action of the subgroup H1 on S1
0 is transitive
and we choose the cross-section S1
1 ⊂S1
0 deﬁned by the condition U1,0 = 0, U0,1 = 0.
The isotropy group H2 ⊂H1 for this cross-section is isomorphic to GL(2, C):
H2 =





To normalize the parameters of R we need to prolong its action:
p
7→
¯p =
p
ap + bq + 1,
q
7→
¯q =
q
ap + bq + 1,
u
7→
¯u = (ap + bq + 1)−n u
to J∞and then restrict it to S∞
0 . The lifted invariant diﬀerential operators are dual
to the lifted contact invariant forms:
d¯p
=
dp + b(qdp −pdq)
σ2
,
d¯q
=
dq + a(pdq −qdp)
σ2
,
where σ = ap + bq + 1 and hence they are equal to:
¯Dp
=
σ2Dp + σq (aDq −bDp) ,
¯Dq
=
σ2Dq + σp (bDp −aDq) .
Thus the ﬁrst prolongation of the action of R is:
u1,0
7→
¯u1,0 = σ1−n (−nau + σup) + σ1−nq (auq −bup) ,
(3.26)
u0,1
7→
¯u0,1 = σ1−n (−nbu + σuq) + σ1−np (bup −aup) .
(3.27)
By restricting the above transformations to S1
0, where p = q = 0 and u = 1 one
obtains the transformations of U1,0 and U0,1:
U1,0 7→¯U1,0 = −na + U1,0,
U1,0 7→¯U0,1 = −nb + U0,1.
(3.28)
Normalization ¯U1,0 = 0 and ¯U0,1 = 0 deﬁnes the group parameters of R:
a = U1,0
n

1−n
n u1,0
n
,
b = U0,1
n
= u
1−n
n u0,1
n
.
(3.29)
To proceed further we need to determine the invariantization of higher order functions
Uk,l under the action of R on S∞
0 . In order to do so we need to compute the lifted
invariants ¯uk,l = ¯Dk
p ¯Dl
q ¯u, restrict them to S∞
0
and then substitute the normalization
(3.29). It is not hard to observe (see also (3.26)) that
¯u1,0 = ¯Dp¯u = σ2Dp¯u + q × (. . . ),

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
69
where the second term in the sum equals to q multiplied by an expression and hence
it is equal to zero when q = 0. In general
¯uk,0( ¯Dp)kv =
 σ2Dp)
k ¯u + q × (. . . ).
The diﬀerential operator in the ﬁrst part of the formula is similar to the one that
produces the prolongation formulas in the case of binary forms and so we obtain the
familiar expressions:

j=0
(−1)k−j
k

(n −k)!ak−jσjuj,0 + q × (. . . ).
We restrict these functions to S∞

substitute the normalization (3.29) to obtain functions:

The function Qk,l are invariant under the transformation (3.24) up to action of H2 ⋍

We can normalize the remaining group parameters by setting

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.

These invariants however are not rational expressions in p and q and so we can not
use Gr¨obner basis elimination algorithm to describe the corresponding signature man-
ifold. Fortunately, by turning back to the classical invariant theory processes we are
able to derive a complete set of fundamental rational invariants.
We ﬁrst note that ¯Qk,l are lifted invariants under the action of H2 ⋍GL(2, C) on

(3.42)
We can also look at ¯Qk,l as on polynomials in {α, β, γ, δ} with coeﬃcients Qi,j. We
note that the coeﬃcients Qi,j are transformed in the same manner as the coeﬃcients
of the binary forms P
i,j ai,jpiqj, where i + j = n, and p and q are transformed as in
(3.42). From the second formula in (3.42) we can see that vectors

Such vectors are called covariant in contrast with contravariant vectors which are
transformed by the left multiplication by A (for instance, p and q form a contravariant
vector). The forms
P2 = ∆2 ¯Q2,0,
P3 = ∆3 ¯Q3,0,
P4 = ∆4 ¯Q4,0,
. . .
are relatively invariant under the simultaneous transformations of
 γ

with weights 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Because of their dependence on a covariant
vector forms Pi are called contravariants (see [21] § 13 for more details on classical
terminology). In the case of binary form there is a duality between covariant vectors
and contravariant vectors. Indeed let µ = −δ and η = γ. Then µ and η form a
contravariant vector of weight −1:

Let Hκ(. . . , Qk,l, . . . ) be a rational invariant of these forms.
We recall that Qk,l
are diﬀerential functions (see formulas (3.30), (3.31) and (3.32)) and so functions
Hκ(. . . , Qk,l, . . . ) provide diﬀerential invariants of the initial action (3.24). We would
like to ﬁnd suﬃciently many of such invariants in order to parameterize the signature
manifold. We start with the following classical relative invariants [18].
The discriminant of quadratic P2:
d2 = Q2,0Q0,2 −Q2

which is a relative invariant of weight 2.

of weight 6.
To obtain joint relative invariants of forms Pi we can apply the omega process, or
transvection (as described in chapter 3, § 48 of [18] and chapter 5 of [28]) to these
forms. Let Φ and Ψ be covariants of weight k1 and k2 respectively then their r-th
transvectant (Φ, Ψ)(r) is a covariant of weight k1 + k2 + r.

Let
H3 = (P4, P4)(2),
H4 = (P4, P4)(2),
T3 = (H3, P3)(1),
T4 = (H4, P4)(1),
S = (H4, P 2
3 )(3).
We note that H’s have weight 2 and they are the Hessians of the corresponding forms,
T’s have weight 3 and their explicit formulas (3.15) are given in the preceding section
on binary forms. We also note that the invariants of single forms can be expressed as

We complete this list with the following joint covariants:

M2 =

Joint invariant of cubic P3 and quartic P4:
M5 =

of weight 9.
Taking into account the weights of the relative invariants above we deﬁne three ab-
solute rational invariants of the third order:

I2 = M2

I3 = d3

Thus we have found eight diﬀerential invariants of order four or less. Since most of
the explicit formulas are long we place them in the Appendix B. Using the Thomas
replacement theorem [13] we can rewrite these invariants in terms of eight independent

By computing (with the help of a computer) the corresponding Jacobian we con-
clude that invariants {I1, . . . , I8} are functionally independent. On the other hand,

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
76
since GL(3, C) acts freely on J4 and dim(J4) = 17, there could be no more than
eight functionally independent invariants and thus {I1, . . . , I8} form a complete set
of diﬀerential invariants of order four or less.
Remark 3.3.2. None of the invariants is deﬁned when I1,1 ≡0 (or equivalently
d2 ≡0). By substitution of the group parameters (3.40) and (3.41) into (3.34) we
conclude that it happens if and only if the inhomogenization of the Hessian:
n f(f 2
pq −fpp fqq) + (n −1) (fpp f 2
q + 2 fp fq fpq + fqq f 2
p)
is identically zero, and hence if and only if the ternary form can be transformed into
a binary form.
In the next section we will use the ﬁrst three invariants to obtain a classiﬁcation
of ternary cubics and their group of symmetries. In the last section we use all eight
invariants to construct the signature manifold for the forms xn + yn + zn, therefore
obtaining necessary and suﬃcient condition for the equivalence of an arbitrary ternary
form of degree n to the sum of n-th powers.
3.4
Classiﬁcation of Ternary Cubics
In this section we reproduce known results on classiﬁcation of ternary cubics up to a
linear transformation ([21], [25]) and then obtain a classiﬁcation of their symmetry
groups, which we believe is new. We achieve this by restricting invariants I1, I2 and I3,
obtained in the previous section to each if the canonical forms. Note that the fourth
order invariants, restricted to a cubic, are zero. By Gr¨obner basis computation we ﬁnd
the ideal, whose zero set deﬁnes the corresponding signature manifold and determine
its dimension. In non-trivial situations we ﬁnd the dimension using Maple function
hilbertdim, based on computing the degree of Hilbert polynomial [8], [14]. Using
Theorem 1.3.8, from Chapter 1 we make a conclusion about the dimension of the
symmetry group, which helps us to determine the group explicitly. In the case of a
ﬁnite symmetry group we ﬁnd its cardinality. We start with
Reducible Cubics.
A reducible cubic is either a product of three linear factors or a product of linear
and quadratic factors. We state the following classiﬁcation theorem:

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
77
Theorem 3.4.1. A reducible cubic F(x, y, z) is equivalent under a linear change of
variables to one of the following forms:
1. If it is a product of there linear factors and
a) all three factors are the same, then it is equivalent to x3 and its symmetry
group, is conjugate to a four-dimensional group isomorphic to GL(2, C),
of linear transformations on the variables y and z;
b) two factors are the same, then the cubic is equivalent to x2y and its symmetry
group is conjugate to four-dimensional group of matrices


α
1
α2
β
γ
δ

;
c) three factors are linearly dependent, but any pair of them is linearly indepen-
dent, then the cubic is equivalent to xy(x + y) and its symmetry group is
conjugate to the three-dimensional direct product of arbitrary linear trans-
formations z 7→αx + βy + γz and a ﬁnite subgroup of order 6 × 3 of
linear transformations on the (x, y)-plane, which preserves xy(x + y) (see
Section 3.2) .
d) there factors are linearly independent factors, then the cubic is equivalent
to xyz and its symmetry group is conjugate to two-dimensional group of
matrices


α
β
1
αβ

;
(3.48)
2. If it is a product of quadratic and linear factors then there are two canonical forms:
a) F(x, y, z) ∼z (x2 + yz). In this case the symmetry group is conjugate to a
two-dimensional group generated by


1
0
α
−2α
1
−α2
0
0
1


and


β
β4
1
β−2

;
(3.49)
b) F(x, y, z) ∼z (x2 +y2 +z2). In this case the symmetry group is conjugate to
a one-dimensional group of rotations around the z-axis which is isomorphic
to O(2, C).

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
78
Proof.
1. The classiﬁcations of the cubics reducible into linear factors is obvious. We
note only that a cubic has repeated factors (cases 1. a) and 1. b)) if and only if its
Hessian is identically zero and so the invariants I1, I2 and I3 are not deﬁned (see
Remark 3.3.2). The graph S of such cubic is a totally singular submanifold in C4,
in a sense that there is no order of prolongation n at which the prolonged action
of the group becomes locally free on jn(S). Thus, none of the constructions from
Chapter 1 can be applied to this case. The graphs of all other cubics deﬁne regular
submanifolds and so, due to Theorem 1.3.8, the dimensions of their symmetry groups
equal to 2 −dim C(Sf) where f(p, q) is the inhomogeneous version of F(x, y, z). The
signature manifold C(Sf), is parameterized by I1(f), I2(f) and I3(f). When the cubic
is equivalent to xyz (case 1. c)) the signature manifold consists of a single point:
I1 = 4
3,
I2 = 16
3 ,
I3 = 16
9 .
and so the symmetry group is two-dimensional. It is easy to check that the group
(3.48) leaves xyz unchanged.
2. The general form of a cubic reducible into linear and quadratic factors is:
F(x, y, z) = (k1x + k2y + k3z)(k4z2 + k5zx + k6zy + K(x, y)),
where ki are some complex coeﬃcients and K(x, y) is a non-zero quadratic form in
two variables. By taking the ﬁrst factor as a new variable z′, one obtains an equivalent
cubic
z (k4z2 + k5zx + k6zy + K(x, y))
where ki are some new coeﬃcients and K(x, y) is a new non-zero quadratic form. It is
known that by a linear change of variables the quadratic K(x, y) can be transformed
to either x2 + y2 or x2. Thus F(x, y, z) is equivalent to either:
z (k2z2 + k3zx + k4zy + x2 + y2)
(3.50)
or
z (k2z2 + k3zx + k4zy + x2),
(3.51)
where ki are again new coeﬃcients.
In the ﬁrst case (3.50) we make the transformation
x′ = (x + k3
2 z);
y′ = (y + k4
2 z);
z′ = z

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
79
to obtain an equivalent form
z (kz2 + x2 + y2).
Finally the scaling:
k1/6x′ = x,
k1/6y′ = y
k−1/3z′ = z
leads to the canonical form:
z (z2 + x2 + y2).
In the second case (3.51) we make the transformation
x′ = (x +
p
k2z);
y′ = k4y + (k3 −2
p
k2)x;
z′ = z/k4.
to obtain an equivalent cubic:
kz (zy + x2).
Finally, we make the transformation: z′ = kz, y′ = 1
ky, which leads to the canonical
form:
z (zy + x2)
We compute the corresponding signature manifolds.
The signature manifold of a
cubic equivalent to z (x2 + yz), consists of a single point:
I1 = −1
6,
I2 = 41
6 ,
I3 = −2
9,
and hence the symmetry group is two-dimensional. Using Lie’s criterion 1.1.12 we
found inﬁnitesimal symmetries:


0
0
1
−2
0
0
0
0
0


and


1
4
−2

;
that give rise to the group (3.49).
The signature manifold of a cubic equivalent to z (x2 +y2 +z2), is deﬁned by three
equations found by Gr¨obner basis computations:
−1482 I3 I2 + 8865 I3
2 + 40 I2
2 −1296 I1 −36 I2 + 17280 I3 −18522 I3 I1,
40 I1 I2 + 582 I3 I1 + 42 I3 I2 −315 I2
3 −144 I1 −4 I2 −480 I3,
360 I2
1 −378 I3I1 −18 I3 I2 + 135 I3
2 −144 I1 −4 I2 + 120 I3

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
80
The the corresponding variety is one-dimensional and thus the symmetry group is
also one-dimensional. We notice that the rotations with respect to the z-axis leave
the canonical form unchanged.
We proceed with the classiﬁcation of the
Irreducible Ternary Cubics:
It is well known that any homogeneous irreducible cubic F(x, y, z) over C can
be transformed by a linear map into Weierstrass normal form [24]. Let V be the
set of zeros of the inhomogenization f(p, q) in CP 2. The normal form is obtained
by transforming one of the inﬂection points of V to the inﬁnite point (0, 1, 0), and
the tangent line at this point to the line (k, 1, 0) at inﬁnity. We state the following
classiﬁcation theorem:
Theorem 3.4.2. An irreducible cubic F(x, y, z) can be transformed under a linear
change of variables to one of the following forms:
1 If f(p,q) deﬁnes a singular variety V then it is equivalent to either
a) p3 −q2 and the it has one-dimensional symmetry group given by:


1
α
1
α2

;
(3.52)
or
b) p2(p+1)−q2, which has a discrete symmetry group, consisting of 6 projective
symmetries (see Deﬁnition 3.1.4 of Section 3.1) which correspond to 18
genuine symmetries.
2 If f(p, q) deﬁnes a nonsingular variety V then it either equivalent to:
a) a cubic in one-parametric family:
p3 + ap + 1 −q2
and then it has 18 projective symmetries.
or
b) it is equivalent to p3 + p −q2. In this case it has 36 projective symmetries,
or

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
81
c) it is equivalent to p3 + 1 −q2. In this case it has 54 projective symmetries.
We note that the cubic p3 + q3 + 1 belongs to this class.
For the proofs of the classiﬁcation theorems we refer the reader to [24], [25],
and restrict ourselves to the discussion of the signature manifolds and the symmetry
groups. In the case 1. a) the signature manifold is deﬁned by two equations:
I1 = −1
6,
6 I2 + 45 I3 −31 = 0
and so the symmetries form a one-dimensional group conjugate to (3.52). We note
that the number of unimodular symmetries is ﬁnite.
In all other cases the symmetry group is ﬁnite. In theory, the projective symme-
tries can be found explicitly by solving the equations
I1(p, q) = I1(P, Q),
I2(p, q) = I2(P, Q),
I3(p, q) = I3(P, Q),
(3.53)
for P and Q in terms of p and q. All solutions must be linear fractional expressions
in p and q. In practice however, we were not able to carry out these computations.
Nevertheless we can ﬁnd the cardinality of the symmetry group using a well known
algebraic geometry result ([8], Proposition 8, ch. 5, § 3).
Proposition 3.4.3. Let I ⊂C[x1, . . . , xn] be an ideal such that its zero set V is ﬁnite
then
(i) The dimension of (C[x1, . . . , xn]/I) (as a vector space over C) is ﬁnite and greater
or equal to the number of points in V .
(i) If I is a radical ideal then equality holds, i.e., the number of points in V is exactly
(C[x1, . . . , xn]/I).
For generic values of P and Q we ﬁnd the number of the solutions for (3.53) by
computing the dimension of the quotient space of C[p, q] by the corresponding ideal.
We use two algorithms presented in the exercises for ch. 2, § 2 of [9], ﬁrst to check
that the ideal deﬁned by (3.53) is radical, and then to compute the dimension of the
quotient.
The nonsingular irreducible ternary cubics are known as elliptic curves and play
an important role in number theory. The number of symmetries for these curves

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.
82
has a natural explanation. First let us consider only the symmetries ﬁxing the point
(0, 1, 0) and mapping the line at inﬁnity to itself.
Following Knapp, [24] we call
these symmetries admissible. It is not diﬃcult to prove [24] that there are only 2
such symmetries in case 2.a), 4 in case 2.b) and 6 in case 2.c). Each of nonsingular
irreducible cubics has 9 inﬂection points. Each of the inﬂection point can be mapped
to (0, 1, 0) with the corresponding tangent line mapped to the line at inﬁnity. We
observe that the number of the projective symmetries of a nonsingular irreducible
cubic equals to the number of its inﬂection point times the number of its admissible
symmetries.
Ternary cubics form a ten-dimensional linear space. So by dimensional considera-
tion we expect to have one absolute invariant depending on the coeﬃcients of cubic.
Indeed such invariant is known [21], [24] and has been used to obtain classiﬁcation
results. This invariant must be expressible in terms of the invariants I1, I2 and I3 but
we have not tried to obtain the explicit formula. Not all of the orbits of GL(3, C)
acting on the space of cubics are closed. In fact only the orbits of elliptic curves, the
orbit of xyz and the orbit of x3 are. See Kraft [25] for the proofs and the description
of how some orbit is included in the closure of the others.
We conclude this section with a simple corollary from Theorems 3.4.1 and 3.4.2:
Corollary 3.4.4. A cubic in three variables splits into a linear factor and an irre-
ducible quadratic factor if and only if its SL(3, C) symmetries form a one-dimensional
Lie group.
Maple computations for ternary cubics can be found in Appendix C.
3.5
The Signature Manifold for xn + yn + zn.
In this section we construct the signature manifold for f(p, q) = pn + qn + 1 therefore
determining the necessarily and suﬃcient condition for a ternary form to be complex
equivalent to the sum of n-th powers. We ﬁrst recall that the action (3.24) becomes
free on the third order jet space J3. We restrict the ﬁrst three invariants to f(p, q) =
pn + qn + 1:

CHAPTER 3. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL INVARIANT THEORY.

=
−(n −2)2
n(n −1)
I2(f)

pn qn
I3(f)
=
−(n −2)4
n2(n −1)2
(pn + 1 −qn)(pn −1 + qn)(pn −1 −qn)
pn qn
We observe that the ﬁrst invariant is constant and we check that the last two are func-
tionally independent. Thus the third order signature manifold has maximal possible
dimension and the symmetry group of f(p, q) is ﬁnite. Moreover, we can conclude
that the diﬀerential invariant order of the graph u = pn + qn + 1 equals to three and
so both equivalence and symmetry problems can be solved by construction the fourth
order signature manifold.
For n > 3 we need to restrict the remaining ﬁve (forth order) invariants to the
graph u = pn + qn + 1:

i4 i2
7 −i3
7 −4 i2
4 + 4 i4 i7 −8 i4 + 12 i7 + i8 −20 = 0.
The corresponding relations among invariants I2(f), I3(f), I4(f), I6(f), I7(f) and
I8(f) follow immediately. Combining them with the conditions:
I1(f) = −(n −2)2
n(n −1)
and
I5(f) = −(n −2)3(n −3)3
n3(n −1)3
and demanding that dim C(f) = 2 (equivalently we demand that the symmetry group
of f is discrete), we thus obtain necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a ternary n-
form to be equivalent to the sum of n-th powers.

Appendix A
Computations on Binary Forms.
A.1
The Maple Code for computing Symmetries
of Binary Forms
The Maple code consists of two main programs — symm and matrices — and two
auxiliary functions — simple and l f. The program symm is the main function. The
input consists of a complex-valued polynomial f(p) considered as the projective ver-
sion of homogeneous binary form F(x, y), and the degree n = deg(F). The program
computes the invariants J and K in reduced form, determines the dimension of the
symmetry group, and, in the case of a ﬁnite symmetry group, applies the Maple
command solve to solve the two polynomial symmetry equations (3.19) to ﬁnd ex-
plicit form of symmetries. The output of symm consists of the projective index of the
form and the explicit formulae for its discrete projective symmetries. The program
also notiﬁes the user if the symmetry group is not discrete, or is in the maximal
discrete symmetry class. The program works well when applied to very simple forms,
but experienced diﬃculties simplifying complicated rational algebraic formulae into
the basic linear fractional form.

The program matrices determines the matrix symmetry corresponding to a given (list
of) projective symmetries. As discussed in the text, this only requires determining an
overall scalar multiple, which can be found by substituting the projective symmetry
into the form. The output consists of each projective symmetry, the scalar factor µ,
and the resulting matrix symmetry.

A more complicated cubic example.
All cubics with a discrete symmetry group are complex equivalent to x3 + y3 and
have projective index 6. However, when we apply the same code to a cubic not in
canonical form. The initial Maple result is not in the correct linear fractional form.
We must simplify the rational algebraic expressions “by hand” to put them in the
form of a projective linear fractional transformation.

The ﬁrst three components of S are in the proper linear fractional form. The
problem with the other expressions is that Maple does not automatically factor
polynomials under a radical. One approach to simpliﬁcation is to ﬁrst do the required
factorization:
>
n1:=factor(9+18*p-81*p^2+261*p^3+27*sqrt(31)*sqrt(3)*p^3
-9*sqrt(31)*sqrt(3)*p^2-sqrt(31)*sqrt(3));

for this symmetry:
