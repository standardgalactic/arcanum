When investigating theories at the tiniest conceivable scales in nature, almost all researchers
today revert to the quantum language, accepting the verdict from the Copenhagen doctrine that
the only way to describe what is going on will always involve states in Hilbert space, controlled
by operator equations. Returning to classical, that is, non quantum mechanical, descriptions
will be forever impossible, unless one accepts some extremely contrived theoretical constructions
that may or may not reproduce the quantum mechanical phenomena observed in experiments.
Dissatisﬁed, this author investigated how one can look at things diﬀerently. This book is an
overview of older material, but also contains many new observations and calculations. Quantum
mechanics is looked upon as a tool, not as a theory. Examples are displayed of models that
are classical in essence, but can be analysed by the use of quantum techniques, and we argue
that even the Standard Model, together with gravitational interactions, might be viewed as a
quantum mechanical approach to analyse a system that could be classical at its core. We explain
how such thoughts can conceivably be reconciled with Bell’s theorem, and how the usual ob-
jections voiced against the notion of ‘superdeterminism’ can be overcome, at least in principle.
Our proposal would eradicate the collapse problem and the measurement problem. Even the
existence of an “arrow of time” can perhaps be explained in a more elegant way than usual.

Preface
This book is not in any way intended to serve as a replacement for the standard theory
of quantum mechanics. A reader not yet thoroughly familiar with the basic concepts of
quantum mechanics is advised ﬁrst to learn this theory from one of the recommended text
books [15][16][37], and only then pick up this book to ﬁnd out that the doctrine called
‘quantum mechanics’ can be viewed as part of a marvellous mathematical machinery that
places physical phenomena in a greater context, and only in the second place as a theory
of nature.
The present version, # 3, has been thoroughly modiﬁed. Some novelties, such as an
unconventional view of the arrow of time, have been added, and other arguments were
further reﬁned. The book is now split in two. Part I deals with the many conceptual
issues, without demanding excessive calculations. Part II adds to this our calculation
techniques, occasionally returning to conceptual issues. Inevitably, the text in both parts
8

will frequently refer to discussions in the other part, but they can be studied separately.
This book is not a novel that has to be read from beginning to end, but rather a
collection of descriptions and derivations, to be used as a reference. Diﬀerent parts can
be read in random order. Some arguments are repeated several times, but each time in a
diﬀerent context.
Part I
The Cellular Automaton Interpretation as a general
doctrine
1.
Motivation for this work
This book is about a theory, and about an interpretation. The theory, as it stands, is
highly speculative. It is born out of dissatisfaction with the existing explanations of a
well-established fact. The fact is that our universe appears to be controlled by the laws
of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics looks weird, but nevertheless it provides for
a very solid basis for doing calculations of all sorts that explain the peculiarities of the
atomic and sub-atomic world. The theory developed in this book starts from assumptions
that, at ﬁrst sight, seem to be natural and straightforward, and we think they can be very
well defended.
Regardless whether the theory is completely right, partly right, or dead wrong, one may
be inspired by the way it looks at quantum mechanics. We are assuming the existence of a
deﬁnite ‘reality’ underlying quantum mechanical descriptions. The assumption that this
reality exists leads to a rather down-to-earth interpretation of what quantum mechanical
calculations are telling us. The interpretation works beautifully and seems to remove
several of the diﬃculties encountered in other descriptions of how one might interpret
the measurements and their ﬁndings. We propose this interpretation that, in our eyes, is
superior to other existing dogmas.
However, numerous extensive investigations have provided very strong evidence that
the assumptions that went into our theory cannot be completely right. The earliest argu-
ments came from von Neumann [5], but these were later hotly debated [7],[18],[60]. The
most convincing arguments came from John S. Bell’s theorem, phrased in terms of in-
equalities that are supposed to hold for any classical interpretation of quantum mechanics,
but are strongly violated by quantum mechanics. Later, many other variations were found
of Bell’s basic idea, some even more powerful. We will discuss these repeatedly, and at
length, in this work. Basically, they all seemed to point in the same direction: from these
theorems, it was concluded by most researchers that the laws of nature cannot possibly
9

be deterministic. So why this book?
There are various reasons why the author decided to hold on to his assumptions
anyway. The ﬁrst reason is that they ﬁt very well with the quantum equations of various
very simple models. It looks as if nature is telling us: “wait, this approach is not so bad
at all!”. The second reason is that one could regard our approach simply as a ﬁrst attempt
at a description of nature that is more realistic than other existing approaches. We can
always later decide to add some twists that introduce indeterminism, in a way more in
line with the afore mentioned theorems; these twists could be very diﬀerent from what is
expected by many experts, but anyway, in that case, we could all emerge out of this ﬁght
victorious. Perhaps there is a subtle form of non-locality in the cellular automata, perhaps
there is some quantum twist in the boundary conditions, or you name it. Why should
Bell’s inequalities forbid me to investigate this alley? I happen to ﬁnd it an interesting
one.
But there is a third reason. This is the strong suspicion that all those “hidden variable
models” that were compared with thought experiments as well as real experiments, are
terribly naive.1 Real deterministic theories have not yet been excluded. If a theory is
deterministic all the way, it implies that not only all observed phenomena, but also the
observers themselves are controlled by deterministic laws. They certainly have no ‘free
will’, their actions all have roots in the past, even the distant past. Allowing an observer
to have free will, that is, to reset his observation apparatus at will without even inﬁnites-
imal disturbances of the surrounding universe, including modiﬁcations in the distant past,
is fundamentally impossible. The notion that, also the actions by experimenters and ob-
servers are controlled by deterministic laws, is called superdeterminism. When discussing
these issues with colleagues the author got the distinct impression that it is here that the
‘no-go’ theorems they usually come up with, can be put in doubt.
We hasten to add that this is not the ﬁrst time that this remark was made [61]. Bell
noticed that superdeterminism could provide for a loophole around his theorem, but as
most researchers also today, he was quick to dismiss it as “absurd”. As we hope to be
able to demonstrate, however, superdeterminism may not quite be as absurd as it seems.2
In any case, realising these facts sheds an interesting new light on our questions, and
the author was strongly motivated just to carry on.
Having said all this, I do admit that what we have is still only a theory. It can and
will be criticised and attacked, as it already was. I know that some readers will not be
convinced. If, in the mind of some others, I succeed to generate some sympathy, even
enthusiasm for these ideas, then my goal has been reached. In a somewhat worse scenario,
my ideas will be just used as an anvil, against which other investigators will sharpen their
own, superior views.
In the mean time, we are developing mathematical notions that seem to be coherent
and beautiful. Not very surprisingly, we do encounter some problems in the formalism
1Indeed, in their eagerness to exclude local, realistic, and/or deterministic theories, authors rarely go
into the trouble to carefully deﬁne what these theories are.
2We do ﬁnd some “absurd” correlation functions, see e.g. subsection 3.6.2.
10

as well, which we try to phrase as accurately as possible. They do indicate that the
problem of generating quantum phenomena out of classical equations is actually quite
complex. The diﬃculty we bounce into is that, although all classical models allow for
a reformulation in terms of some ‘quantum’ system, the resulting quantum system will
often not have a Hamiltonian that is local and properly bounded from below. It may
well be that models that do produce acceptable Hamiltonians will demand inclusion of
non-perturbative gravitational eﬀects, which are indeed diﬃcult and ill-understood at
present.
It is unlikely, in the mind of the author, that these complicated schemes can be wiped
oﬀthe table in a few lines, as is asserted by some3.
Instead, they warrant intensive
investigation. As stated, if we can make the theories more solid, they would provide for
extremely elegant foundations that underpin the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of
quantum mechanics. It will be shown in this book that we can arrive at Hamiltonians
that are almost both local and bounded from below. These models are like quantised ﬁeld
theories, which also suﬀer from mathematical imperfections, as is well-known.
Furthermore, one may question why we would have to require locality of the quantum
model at all, as long as the underlying classical model is manifestly local by construction.
What we exactly mean by all this will be explained, mostly in part II where we allow
ourselves to perform detailed calculations.
1.1.
Why an interpretation is needed
The discovery of quantum mechanics may well have been the most important scientiﬁc
revolution of the 20th century. Not only the world of atoms and subatomic particles
appears to be completely controlled by the rules of quantum mechanics, but also the worlds
of solid state physics, chemistry, thermodynamics, and all radiation phenomena can only
be understood by observing the laws of the quanta. The successes of quantum mechanics
are phenomenal, and furthermore, the theory appears to be reigned by marvellous and
impeccable internal mathematical logic.
Not very surprisingly, this great scientiﬁc achievement also caught the attention of
scientists from other ﬁelds, and from philosophers, as well as the public in general. It is
therefore perhaps somewhat curious that, even after nearly a full century, physicists still
do not quite agree on what the theory tells us – and what it does not tell us – about
reality.
The reason why quantum mechanics works so well is that, in practically all areas
of its applications, exactly what reality means turns out to be immaterial.
All that
this theory4 says, and that needs to be said, is about the reality of the outcomes of an
experiment.
Quantum mechanics tells us exactly what one should expect, how these
3At various places in this book, we explain what is wrong with those ‘few lines’.
4Interchangeably, we use the word ‘theory’ for quantum mechanics itself, and for models of particle
interactions; therefore, it might be better to refer to quantum mechanics as a framework, assisting us
in devising theories for sub systems, but we expect that our use of the concept of ‘theory’ should not
generate any confusion.
11

outcomes may be distributed statistically, and how these can be used to deduce details
of its internal parameters. Elementary particles are one of the prime targets here. A
theory4 has been arrived at, the so-called Standard Model, that requires the speciﬁcation
of some 25 internal constants of nature, parameters that cannot be predicted using present
knowledge. Most of these parameters could be determined from the experimental results,
with varied accuracies. Quantum mechanics works ﬂawlessly every time.
So, quantum mechanics, with all its peculiarities, is rightfully regarded as one of the
most profound discoveries in the ﬁeld of physics, revolutionising our understanding of
many features of the atomic and sub-atomic world.
But physics is not ﬁnished.
In spite of some over-enthusiastic proclamations just
before the turn of the century, the Theory of Everything has not yet been discovered,
and there are other open questions reminding us that physicists have not yet done their
job completely. Therefore, encouraged by the great achievements we witnessed in the
past, scientists continue along the path that has been so successful. New experiments
are being designed, and new theories are developed, each with ever increasing ingenuity
and imagination. Of course, what we have learned to do is to incorporate every piece of
knowledge gained in the past, in our new theories, and even in our wilder ideas.
But then, there is a question of strategy. Which roads should we follow if we wish to
put the last pieces of our jig-saw puzzle in place? Or even more to the point: what do
we expect those last jig-saw pieces to look like? And in particular: should we expect the
ultimate future theory to be quantum mechanical?
It is at this point that opinions among researchers vary, which is how it should be in
science, so we do not complain about this. On the contrary, we are inspired to search
with utter concentration precisely at those spots where no-one else has taken the trouble
to look before. The subject of this book is the ‘reality’ behind quantum mechanics. Our
suspicion is that it may be very diﬀerent from what can be read in most text books. We
actually advocate the notion that it might be simpler than anything that can be read
in the text books. If this is really so, this might greatly facilitate our quest for better
theoretical understanding.
Many of the ideas expressed and worked out in this treatise are very basic. Clearly,
we are not the ﬁrst to advocate these ideas. The reason why one rarely hears about the
obvious and simple observations that we will make, is that they have been made many
times, in the recent and the more ancient past [5], and were subsequently categorically
dismissed.
The primary reason why they have been dismissed is that they were unsuccessful;
classical, deterministic models that produce the same results as quantum mechanics were
devised, adapted and modiﬁed, but whatever was attempted ended up looking much uglier
than the original theory, which was plain quantum mechanics with no further questions
asked.
The quantum mechanical theory describing relativistic, subatomic particles is
called quantum ﬁeld theory (see part II, chapter 20), and it obeys fundamental conditions
such as causality, locality and unitarity. Demanding all of these desirable properties was
the core of the successes of quantum ﬁeld theory, and that eventually gave us the Standard
12

Model of the sub-atomic particles. If we try to reproduce the results of quantum ﬁeld
theory in terms of some deterministic underlying theory, it seems that one has to abandon
at least one of these demands, which would remove much of the beauty of the generally
accepted theory; it is much simpler not to do so, and therefore, as for the requirement of
the existence of a classical underlying theory, one usually simply drops that.
Not only does it seem to be unnecessary to assume the existence of a classical world
underlying quantum mechanics, it seems to be impossible also. Not very surprisingly,
researchers turn their heads in disdain, but just before doing so, there was one more
thing to do: if, invariably, deterministic models that were intended to reproduce typically
quantum mechanical eﬀects, appear to get stranded in contradictions, maybe one can
prove that such models are impossible. This may look like the more noble alley: close the
door for good.
A way to do this was to address the famous Gedanken experiment designed by Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen [6]. This experiment suggested that quantum particles are associated
with more than just a wave function; to make quantum mechanics describe ‘reality’, some
sort of ‘hidden variables’ seemed to be needed. What could be done was to prove that
such hidden variables are self-contradictory. We call this a ‘no-go theorem’. The most
notorious, and most basic, example was Bell’s theorem [18], as we already mentioned. Bell
studied the correlations between measurements of entangled particles, and found that, if
the initial state for these particles is chosen to be suﬃciently generic, the correlations
found at the end of the experiment, as predicted by quantum mechanics, can never be
reproduced by information carriers that transport classical information. He expressed
this in terms of the so-called Bell inequalities, later extended as CHSH inequality [20].
They are obeyed by any classical system but strongly violated by quantum mechanics. It
appeared to be inevitable to conclude that we have to give up producing classical, local,
realistic theories. They don’t exist.
So why the present treatise? Almost every day, we receive mail from amateur physi-
cists telling us why established science is all wrong, and what they think a “theory of
everything” should look like. Now it may seem that I am treading in their foot steps. Am
I suggesting that nearly one hundred years of investigations of quantum mechanics have
been wasted? Not at all. I insist that the last century of research lead to magniﬁcent
results, and that the only thing missing so-far was a more radical description of what has
been found. Not the equations were wrong, not the technology, but only the wording of
what is often referred to as the Copenhagen Interpretation should be replaced. Up to
today, the theory of quantum mechanics consisted of a set of very rigorous rules as to how
amplitudes of wave functions refer to the probabilities for various diﬀerent outcomes of
an experiment. It was stated emphatically that they are not referring to ‘what is really
happening’. One should not ask what is really happening, one should be content with the
predictions concerning the experimental results. The idea that no such ‘reality’ should
exist at all sounds mysterious. It is my intention to remove every single bit of mysticism
from quantum theory, and we intend to deduce facts about reality anyway.
Quantum mechanics is one of the most brilliant results of one century of science,
and it is not my intention to replace it by some mutilated version, no matter how slight
13

the mutilation would be. Most of the text books on quantum mechanics will not need
the slightest revision anywhere, except perhaps when they state that questions about
reality are forbidden.
All practical calculations on the numerous stupefying quantum
phenomena can be kept as they are. It is indeed in quite a few competing theories about
the interpretation of quantum mechanics where authors are led to introduce non-linearities
in the Schr¨odinger equation or violations of the Born rule that will be impermissible in
this work.
As for ‘entangled particles’, since it is known how to produce such states in practice,
their odd-looking behaviour must be completely taken care of in our approach.
The ‘collapse of the wave function’ is a typical topic of discussion, where several re-
searchers believe a modiﬁcation of Schr¨odinger’s equation is required. Not so in this work,
as we shall explain. We also ﬁnd surprisingly natural answers to questions concerning
‘Schr¨odinger’s cat’, and the ‘arrow of time’.
And as of ‘no-go theorems’, this author has seen several of them, standing in the way
of further progress. One always has to take the assumptions into consideration, just as
the small print in a contract.
1.2.
Outline of the ideas exposed in part I
Our starting point will be extremely simple and straightforward, in fact so much so that
some readers may simply conclude that I am losing my mind. However, with questions
of the sort I will be asking, it is inevitable to start at the very basic beginning. We start
with just any classical system that vaguely looks like our universe, with the intention to
reﬁne it whenever we ﬁnd this to be appropriate. Will we need non-local interactions?
Will we need information loss? Must we include some version of a gravitational force? Or
will the whole project run astray? We won’t know unless we try.
The price we do pay seems to be a modest one, but it needs to be mentioned: we have
to select a very special set of mutually orthogonal states in Hilbert space that are endowed
with the status of being ‘real’. This set consists of the states the universe can ‘really’
be in. At all times, the universe chooses one of these states to be in, with probability
1, while all others carry probability 0. We call these states ontological states, and they
form a special basis for Hilbert space, the ontological basis. One could say that this is
just wording, so this price we pay is aﬀordable, but we will assume this very special basis
to have special properties. What this does imply is that the quantum theories we end up
with all form a very special subset of all quantum theories. This then, could lead to new
physics, which is why we believe our approach will warrant attention: eventually, our aim
is not just a reinterpretation of quantum mechanics, but the discovery of new tools for
model building.
One might expect that our approach, having such a precarious relationship with both
standard quantum mechanics and other insights concerning the interpretation of quantum
mechanics, should quickly strand in contradictions. This is perhaps the more remarkable
observation one then makes: it works quite well! Several models can be constructed that
14

reproduce quantum mechanics without the slightest modiﬁcation, as will be shown in much
more detail in part II. All our simple models are quite straightforward. The numerous
responses I received, saying that the models I produce “somehow aren’t real quantum
mechanics” are simply mistaken. They are really quantum mechanical. However, I will
be the ﬁrst to remark that one can nonetheless criticise our results: the models are either
too simple, which means they do not describe interesting, interacting particles, or they
seem to exhibit more subtle defects. In particular, reproducing realistic quantum models
for locally interacting quantum particles along the lines proposed, has as yet shown to
be beyond what we can do. As an excuse I can only plead that this would require not
only the reproduction of a complete, renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theoretical model, but
in addition it may well demand the incorporation of a perfectly quantised version of the
gravitational force, so indeed it should not surprise anyone that this is hard.
Numerous earlier attempts have been made to ﬁnd holes in the arguments initiated
by Bell, and corroborated by others. Most of these falsiﬁcation arguments have been
rightfully dismissed.
But now it is our turn.
Knowing what the locality structure is
expected to be in our models, and why we nevertheless think they reproduce quantum
mechanics, we can now attempt to locate the cause of this apparent disagreement. Is the
fault in our models or in the arguments of Bell c.s.? What could be the cause of this
discrepancy? If we take one of our classical models, what goes wrong in a Bell experiment
with entangled particles? Were assumptions made that do not hold? Do particles in our
models perhaps refuse to get entangled? This way, we hope to contribute to an ongoing
discussion.
The aim of the present study is to work out some fundamental physical principles.
Some of them are nearly as general as the fundamental, canonical theory of classical
mechanics. The way we deviate from standard methods is that, more frequently than
usual, we introduce discrete kinetic variables.
We demonstrate that such models not
only appear to have much in common with quantum mechanics. In many cases, they are
quantum mechanical, but also classical at the same time. Some of our models occupy
a domain in between classical and quantum mechanics, a domain often thought to be
empty.
Will this lead to a revolutionary alternative view on what quantum mechanics is? The
diﬃculties with the sign of the energy and the locality of the eﬀective Hamiltonians in
our theories have not yet been settled. In the real world there is a lower bound for the
total energy, so that there is a vacuum state. The subtleties associated with that are
postponed to part II, since they require detailed calculations. In summary: we suspect
that there will be several ways to overcome this diﬃculty, or better still, that it can be
used to explain some of the apparent contradictions in quantum mechanics.
The complete and unquestionable answers to many questions are not given in this
treatise, but we are homing in to some important observations.
As has happened in
other examples of “no-go theorems”, Bell and his followers did make assumptions, and in
their case also, the assumptions appeared to be utterly reasonable. Nevertheless we now
suspect that some of the premises made by Bell may have to be relaxed. Our theory is not
yet complete, and a reader strongly opposed to what we are trying to do here, may well
15

be able to ﬁnd a stick that seems suitable to destroy it. Others, I hope, will be inspired
to continue along this path.
We invite the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. We do intend to achieve
that questions concerning the deeper meanings of quantum mechanics are illuminated
from a new perspective. This we do by setting up models and by doing calculations in
these models. Now this has been done before, but most models I have seen appear to
be too contrived, either requiring the existence of inﬁnitely many universes all interfering
with one another, or modifying the equations of quantum mechanics, while the original
equations seem to be beautifully coherent and functional.
Our models suggest that Einstein may have been right, when he objected against
the conclusions drawn by Bohr and Heisenberg. It may well be that, at its most basic
level, there is no randomness in nature, no fundamentally statistical aspect to the laws
of evolution. Everything, up to the most minute detail, is controlled by invariable laws.
Every signiﬁcant event in our universe takes place for a reason, it was caused by the action
of physical law, not just by chance. This is the general picture conveyed by this book.
We know that it looks as if Bell’s inequalities have refuted this possibility, so yes, they
raise interesting and important questions that we shall address at various levels.
It may seem that I am employing rather long arguments to make my point5. The most
essential elements of our reasoning will show to be short and simple, but just because I
want chapters of this book to be self-sustained, well readable and understandable, there
will be some repetitions of arguments here and there, for which I apologise. I also apologise
for the fact that some parts of the calculations are at a very basic level; the hope is that
this will also make this work accessible for a larger class of scientists and students.
The most elegant way to handle quantum mechanics in all its generality is Dirac’s
bra-ket formalism (section 1.4). We stress that Hilbert space is a central tool for physics,
not only for quantum mechanics. It can be applied in much more general systems than
the standard quantum models such as the hydrogen atom, and it will be used also in com-
pletely deterministic models (we can even use it in Newton’s description of the planetary
system, see subsection 5.7.1).
In any description of a model, one ﬁrst chooses a basis in Hilbert space. Then, what is
needed is a Hamiltonian, in order to describe dynamics. A very special feature of Hilbert
space is that one can use any basis one likes. The transformation from one basis to another
is a unitary transformation, and we shall frequently make use of such transformations.
Everything written about this in sections 1.4, 3.1 and 11.3 is completely standard.
In part I of the book, we describe the philosophy of the Cellular Automaton Interpre-
tation (CAI) without too many technical calculations. After the Introduction, we ﬁrst
demonstrate the most basic prototype of a model, the Cogwheel Model, in chapter 2.
In chapters 3 and 4, we begin to deal with the real subject of this research: the question
of the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The standard approach, referred to as the
Copenhagen Interpretation, is dealt with very brieﬂy, emphasising those points where we
5A wise lesson to be drawn from one’s life experiences is, that long arguments are often much more
dubious than short ones.
16

have something to say, in particular the Bell and the CHSH inequalities.
Subsequently, we formulate as clearly as possible what we mean with determinis-
tic quantum mechanics. The Cellular Automaton Interpretation of quantum mechanics
(chapters 4 and 5) must sound as a blasphemy to some quantum physicists, but this is
because we do not go along with some of the assumptions usually made. Most notably, it
is the assumption that space-like correlations in the beables of this world cannot possibly
generate the ‘conspiracy’ that seems to be required to violate Bell’s inequality. We derive
the existence of such correlations.
We end chapter 3 with one of the more important fundamental ideas of the CAI: our
hidden variables do contain ‘hidden information’ about the future, notably the settings
that will be chosen by Alice an Bob, but it is fundamentally non-local information, impos-
sible to harvest even in principle (subsection 3.6.2). This should not be seen as a violation
of causality.
Even if it is still unclear whether or not the results of these correlations have a con-
spiratory nature, one can base a useful and functional interpretation doctrine from the
assumption that the only conspiracy the equations perform is to fool some of today’s
physicists, while they act in complete harmony with credible sets of physical laws. The
measurement process and the collapse of the wave function are two riddles that are com-
pletely resolved by this assumption, as will be indicated.
We hope to inspire more physicists to investigate these possibilities, to consider seri-
ously the possibility that quantum mechanics as we know it is not a fundamental, mysteri-
ous, impenetrable feature of our physical world, but rather an instrument to statistically
describe a world where the physical laws, at their most basic roots, are not quantum
mechanical at all. Sure, we do not know how to formulate the most basic laws at present,
but we are collecting indications that a classical world underlying quantum mechanics
does exist.
Our models show how to put quantum mechanics on hold when we are constructing
models such as string theory and “quantum” gravity, and this may lead to much improved
understanding of our world at the Planck scale. Many chapters are reasonably self sus-
tained; one may choose to go directly to the parts where the basic features of the Cellular
Automaton Interpretation (CAI) are exposed, chapters 3 – 10, or look at the explicit
calculations done in part II.
In chapter 5.2, we display the rules of the game. Readers might want to jump to this
chapter directly, but might then be mystiﬁed by some of our assertions if one has not
yet been exposed to the general working philosophy developed in the previous chapters.
Well, you don’t have to take everything for granted; there are still problems unsolved,
and further alleys to be investigated. They are in chapter 9, where it can be seen how
the various issues show up in calculations.
Part II of this book is not intended to impress the reader or to scare him or her
away. The explicit calculations carried out there are displayed in order to develop and
demonstrate our calculation tools; only few of these results are used in the more general
discussions in the ﬁrst part. Just skip them if you don’t like them.
17

1.3.
A 19 th century philosophy
Let us go back to the 19th century. Imagine that mathematics were at a very advanced
level, but nothing of the 20th century physics was known. Suppose someone had phrased a
detailed hypothesis about his world being a cellular automaton6. The cellular automaton
will be precisely deﬁned in section 5.1 and in part II; for now, it suﬃces to characterise
it by the requirement that the states Nature can be in are given by sequences of integers.
The evolution law is a classical algorithm that tells unambiguously how these integers
evolve in time. Quantum mechanics does not enter; it is unheard of. The evolution law is
suﬃciently non-trivial to make our cellular automaton behave as a universal computer [35].
This means that, at its tiniest time and distance scale, initial states could be chosen
such that any mathematical equation can be solved with it. This means that it will be
impossible to derive exactly how the automaton will behave at large time intervals; it will
be far too complex.
Mathematicians will realise that one should not even try to deduce exactly what the
large-time and large-distance properties of this theory will be, but they may decide to try
something else. Can one, perhaps, make some statistical statements about the large scale
behaviour?
In ﬁrst approximation, just white noise may be seen to emerge, but upon closer in-
spection, the system may develop non-trivial correlations in its series of integers; some of
the correlation functions may be calculable, just the way these may be calculated in a Van
der Waals gas. We cannot rigorously compute the trajectories of individual molecules in
this gas, but we can derive free energy and pressure of the gas as a function of density
and temperature, we can derive its viscosity and other bulk properties. Clearly, this is
what our 19th century mathematicians should do with their cellular automaton model
of their world. In this book we will indicate how physicists and mathematicians of the
20th and 21st centuries can do even more: they have a tool called quantum mechanics to
derive and understand even more sophisticated details, but even they will have to admit
that exact calculations are impossible. The only eﬀective, large scale laws that they can
ever expect to derive are statistical ones. The average outcomes of experiments can be
predicted, but not the outcomes of individual experiments; for doing that, the evolution
equations are far too diﬃcult to handle.
In short, our imaginary 19th century world will seem to be controlled by eﬀective
laws with a large stochastic element in them. This means that, in addition to an eﬀective
deterministic law, random number generators may seem to be at work that are funda-
mentally unpredictable. On the face of it, these eﬀective laws together may look quite a
bit like the quantum mechanical laws we have today for the sub-atomic particles.
The above metaphor is of course not perfect. The Van der Waals gas does obey general
equations of state, one can understand how sound waves behave in such a gas, but it is
not quantum mechanical. One could suspect that this is because the microscopic laws
assumed to be at the basis of a Van der Waals gas are very diﬀerent from a cellular
6One such person is E. Fredkin, an expert in numerical computation techniques, with whom we had
lengthy discussions. The idea itself was of course much older [19][52].
18

automaton, but it is not known whether this might be suﬃcient to explain why the Van
der Waals gas is clearly not quantum mechanical.
What we do wish to deduce from this reasoning is that one feature of our world is
not mysterious: the fact that we have eﬀective laws that require a stochastic element
in the form of an apparently perfect random number generator, is something we should
not be surprised about. Our 19th century physicists would be happy with what their
mathematicians give them, and they would have been totally prepared for the ﬁndings of
20th century physicists, which implied that indeed the eﬀective laws controlling hydrogen
atoms contain a stochastic element, for instance to determine at what moment exactly an
excited atom decides to emit a photon.
This may be the deeper philosophical reason why we have quantum mechanics: not
all features of the cellular automaton at the basis of our world allow to be extrapolated to
large scales. Clearly, the exposition of this chapter is entirely non-technical and it may be
a bad representation of all the subtleties of the theory we call quantum mechanics today.
Yet we think it already captures some of the elements of the story we want to tell. If
they had access to the mathematics known today, we may be led to the conclusion that
our 19th century physicists could have been able to derive an eﬀective quantum theory
for their automaton model of the world. Would the 19th century physicists be able to
do experiments with entangled photons? This question we postpone to section 3.6 and
onwards.
Philosophising about the diﬀerent turns the course of history could have chosen, imag-
ine the following. In the 19th century, the theory of atoms already existed. They could
have been regarded as physicists’ ﬁrst successful step to discretise the world: atoms are
the quanta of matter. Yet energy, momenta, and angular momenta were still assumed to
be continuous. Would it not have been natural to suspect these to be discrete as well? In
our world, this insight came with the discovery of quantum mechanics. But even today,
space and time themselves are still strictly continuous entities. When will we discover that
everything in the physical world will eventually be discrete? This would be the discrete,
deterministic world underlying our present theories. In this scenario, quantum mechanics
as we know it, is the imperfect logic resulting from an incomplete discretisation7.
1.4.
Notation
In most parts of this book, quantum mechanics will be used as a tool kit, not a theory.
Our theory may be anything; one of our tools will be Hilbert space and the mathematical
manipulations that can be done in that space. Although we do assume the reader to be
familiar with these concepts, we brieﬂy recapitulate what a Hilbert space is.
Hilbert space H is a complex8 vector space, whose number of dimensions is usually
7As I write this, I expect numerous letters by amateurs, but beware, as it would be easy to propose
some completely discretized concoction, but it is very hard to ﬁnd the right theory, one that helps us to
understand the world as it is using rigorous mathematics.
8Some critical readers were wondering where the complex numbers in quantum mechanics should come
from, given the fact that we start oﬀfrom classical theories. The answer is simple: complex numbers
19

inﬁnite, but sometimes we allow that to be a ﬁnite number. Its elements are called states,
denoted as |ψ⟩, |ϕ⟩, or any other “ket”.
We have linearity: whenever |ψ1⟩and ψ2⟩are states in our Hilbert space, then
|ϕ⟩= λ|ψ1⟩+ µ|ψ2⟩,
(1.1)
where λ and µ are complex numbers, is also a state in this Hilbert space. For every
ket-state |ψ⟩we have a ‘conjugated bra-state’, ⟨ψ| , spanning a conjugated vector space,
⟨ψ|, ⟨ϕ| . This means that, if Eq. (1.1) holds, then
⟨ϕ| = λ∗⟨ψ1| + µ∗⟨ψ2| .
(1.2)
Furthermore, we have an inner product, or inproduct: if we have a bra, ⟨χ| , and a ket,
|ψ⟩, then a complex number is deﬁned, the inner product denoted by ⟨χ|ψ⟩, obeying
⟨χ|(λ|ψ1⟩+ µ|ψ2⟩) = λ⟨χ|ψ1⟩+ µ⟨χ|ψ2⟩;
⟨χ|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|χ⟩∗.
(1.3)
The inner product of a ket state |ψ⟩with its own bra is real and positive:
∥ψ∥2 ≡⟨ψ|ψ⟩= real and ≥0 ,
(1.4)
while
⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 0 ↔|ψ⟩= 0 .
(1.5)
Therefore, the inner product can be used to deﬁne a norm. A state |ψ⟩is called a physical
state, or normalised state, if
∥ψ∥2 = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1 .
(1.6)
Later, we shall use the word template to denote such state (the word ‘physical state’ would
be confusing and is better to be avoided). The full power of Dirac’s notation is exploited
further in part II.
Variables will sometimes be just numbers, and sometimes operators in Hilbert space.
If the distinction should be made, or if clarity may demand it, operators will be denoted
as such. We decided to do this simply by adding a super- or subscript “op” to the symbol
in question.9
The Pauli matrices, ⃗σ = (σx, σy, σz) are deﬁned to be the 2 × 2 matrices

are nothing but man-made inventions, just as real numbers are. In Hilbert space, they are useful tools
whenever we discuss something that is conserved in time (such as baryon number), and when we want to
diagonalise a Hamiltonian. Note that quantum mechanics can be formulated without complex numbers,
if we accept that the Hamiltonian is an anti symmetric matrix. But then, its eigen values are imaginary.
We emphasise that imaginary numbers are primarily used to do mathematics, and for that reason they
are indispensable for physics.
9Doing this absolutely everywhere for all operators was a bit too much to ask. When an operator just
amounts to multiplication by a function we often omit the super- or subscript “op”, and in some other
places we just mention clearly the fact that we are discussing an operator.

Deterministic models in quantum notation
2.1.
The basic structure of deterministic models
For deterministic models, we will be using the same Dirac notation. A physical state |A⟩,
where A may stand for any array of numbers, not necessarily integers or real numbers,
is called an ontological state if it is a state our deterministic system can be in. These
states themselves do not form a Hilbert space, since in a deterministic theory we have no
superpositions, but we can declare that they form a basis for a Hilbert space that we may
herewith deﬁne [70][73], by deciding, once and for all, that all ontological states form an
orthonormal set:
⟨A|B⟩≡δAB .
(2.1)
We can allow this set to generate a Hilbert space if we declare what we mean when we
talk about superpositions. In Hilbert space, we now introduce the quantum states |ψ⟩,
as being more general than the ontological states:
|ψ⟩=
X
A
λA|A⟩,
X
A
|λA|2 ≡1 .
(2.2)
A quantum state can be used as a template for doing physics. With this we mean the
following:
A template is a quantum state of the form (2.2) describing a situation where
the probability to ﬁnd our system to be in the ontological state |A⟩is |λA|2 .
Note, that λA is allowed to be a complex or negative number, whereas the phase of λA
plays no role whatsoever. In spite of this, complex numbers will turn out to be quite
useful here, as we shall see. Using the square in Eq. (2.2) and in our deﬁnition above, is
a fairly arbitrary choice; in principle, we could have used a diﬀerent power. Here, we use
the squares because this is by far the most useful choice; diﬀerent powers would not aﬀect
the physics, but would result in unnecessary mathematical complications. The squares
ensure that probability conservation amounts to a proper normalisation of the template
states, and enable the use of unitary matrices in our transformations.
Occasionally, we may allow the indicators A, B, · · · to represent continuous variables,
a straightforward generalisation. In that case, we have a continuous deterministic system;
the Kronecker delta in Eq. (2.1) is then replaced by a Dirac delta, and the sums in Eq. (2.2)
will be replaced by integrals. For now, to be explicit, we stick to a discrete notation.
We emphasise that the template states are not ontological. Hence we have no direct
interpretation, as yet, for the inner products ⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩if both |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩are template
states. Only the absolute squares of ⟨A|ψ⟩, where ⟨A| is the conjugate of an ontological
state, denote the probabilities |λA|2 . We brieﬂy return to this in subsection 5.5.3.
The time evolution of a deterministic model can now be written in operator form:
|A(t)⟩= |P (t)
op A(0)⟩,
(2.3)
21

where P (t)
op is a permutation operator. We can write P (t)
op as a matrix P (t)
AB containing
only ones and zeros. Then, Eq. (2.3) is written as a matrix equation,
|A(t⟩) = UAB(t)|B(0)⟩,
U(t)AB = P (t)
AB .
(2.4)
By deﬁnition therefore, the matrix elements of the operator U(t) in this bases can only
be 0 or 1.
It is very important, at this stage, that we choose P (t)
op to be a genuine permutator,
that is, it should be invertible.10 If the evolution law is time-independent, we have
P (t)
op =

P (δt)
op
t/δt
,
Uop(t) =

Uop(δt)
t/δt
,
(2.5)
where the permutator P (δt)
op , and its associated matrix Uop(δt) describe the evolution
over the shortest possible time step, δt .
Note, that no harm is done if some of the entries in the matrix U(δt)ab , instead of 1,
are chosen to be unimodular complex numbers. Usually, however, we see no reason to do
so, since a simple rotation of an ontological state in the complex plane has no physical
meaning, but it could be useful for doing mathematics (for example, in section 15 of part
II, we use the entries ±1 and 0 in our evolution operators).
We can now state our ﬁrst important mathematical observation:
The quantum-, or template-, states |ψ⟩all obey the same evolution equation:
|ψ(t)⟩= Uop(t)|ψ(0)⟩.
(2.6)
It is easy to observe that, indeed, the probabilities |λA|2 evolve as expected.11
Much of the work described in this book will be about writing the evolution operators
Uop(t) as exponentials: Find a hermitean operator Hop such that
Uop(δt) = e−iHop δt ,
so that
Uop(t) = e−iHopt .
(2.7)
This elevates the time variable t to be continuous, if it originally could only be a multiple
of δt . Finding an example of such an operator is actually easy. If, for simplicity, we
restrict ourselves to template states |ψ⟩that are orthogonal to the eigenstate of Uop
with eigenvalue 1, then
Hop δt = π −i
∞
X
n=1
1
n (Uop(n δt) −Uop(−n δt))
(2.8)
is a solution of Eq. (2.7). This equation can be checked by Fourier analysis, see part II,
section 12.2, Eqs (12.8) – (12.10).
10One can imagine deterministic models where P (t)
op
does not have an inverse, which means that two
diﬀerent ontological states might both evolve into the same state later. We will consider this possibility
later, see chapter 7.
11At this stage of the theory, one may still deﬁne probabilities to be given as diﬀerent functions of λA ,
in line with the observation just made after Eq. (2.2).
22

Note that a correction is needed: the lowest eigenstate |∅⟩of H , the ground state,
has Uop|∅⟩= |∅⟩and Hop|∅⟩= 0 , so that Eq. (2.8) is invalid for that state, but here this
is a minor detail12 (it is the only state for which Eq. (2.8) fails). If we have a periodic
automaton, the equation can be replaced by a ﬁnite sum, also valid for the lowest energy
state, see subsection 2.2.1.
There is one more reason why this is not always the Hamiltonian we want: its eigenval-
ues will always be between −π/δt and π/δt , while sometimes we may want expressions
for the energy that take larger values (see for instance section 5.1).
We do conclude that there is always a Hamiltonian. We repeat that the ontological
states, as well as all other template states (2.2) obey the Schr¨odinger equation,
d
dt|ψ(t)⟩= −iHop|ψ(t)⟩,
(2.9)
which reproduces the discrete evolution law (2.7) at all times t that are integer multiples
of δt . Therefore, we always reproduce some kind of “quantum” theory!
2.1.1.
Operators: Beables, Changeables and Superimposables
We plan to distinguish three types of operators:
(I) beables: these denote a property of the ontological states, so that beables are diag-
onal in the ontological basis {|A⟩, |B⟩, · · ·} of Hilbert space:
Oop|A⟩= O(A)|A⟩,
(beable) .
(2.10)
(II) changeables: operators that replace an ontological state by another ontological state,
such as a permutation operator:
Oop|A⟩= |B⟩,
(changeable) ;
(2.11)
These operators act as pure permutations.
(III) superimposables: these map ontological states onto superpositions of ontological
states:
Oop|A⟩= λ1|A⟩+ λ2|B⟩+ · · · .
(2.12)
Now, we will construct a number of examples. In part II, we shall see more examples of
constructions of beable operators (e.g. section 15.2).
2.2.
The Cogwheel Model
One of the simplest deterministic models is a system that can be in just 3 states, called
(1), (2), and (3). The time evolution law is that, at the beat of a clock, (1) evolves into
12In part II, we shall see the importance of having one state for which our identities fail, the so-called
edge state.

(2), (2) evolves into (3), and state (3) evolves into (1), see Fig. 1 a . Let the clock beat
with time intervals δt . As was explained in the previous section, we associate Dirac kets
to these states, so we have the states |1⟩, |2⟩, and |3⟩. The evolution operator Uop(δt)
is then the matrix
Uop(δt) =


0

(2.13)
It is now useful to diagonalise this matrix. Its eigenstates are |0⟩H , |1⟩H , and |2⟩H ,
deﬁned as



|0⟩H
e−2πi/3|1⟩H
e−4πi/3 |2⟩H

.
(2.15)
In this basis, we can write this as
Uop = e−iHopδt ,
with
Hop = 2π
3 δt diag(0, 1, 2) .
(2.16)
At times t that are integer multiples of δt , we have, in this basis,
Uop(t) = e−iHop t ,
(2.17)
but of course, this equation holds in every basis. In terms of the ontological basis of the
original states |1⟩, |2⟩, and |3⟩, the Hamiltonian (2.16) reads
Hop = 2π

Thus, we conclude that a template state |ψ⟩= λ(t)|1⟩+ µ(t)|2⟩+ ν(t)|3⟩that obeys the
Schr¨odinger equation
d
dt|ψ⟩= −iHop|ψ⟩,
(2.19)
24

with the Hamiltonian (2.18), will be in the state described by the cogwheel model at all
times t that are an integral multiple of δt . This is enough reason to claim that the
“quantum” model obeying this Schr¨odinger equation is mathematically equivalent to our
deterministic cogwheel model.
The fact that the equivalence only holds at integer multiples of δt is not a restriction.
Imagine δt to be as small as the Planck time, 10−43 seconds (see chapter 6), then, if
any observable changes take place only on much larger time scales, deviations from the
ontological model will be unobservable. The fact the the ontological and the quantum
model coincide at all integer multiples of the time dt , is physically important. Note, that
the original ontological model was not at all deﬁned at non-integer time; we could simply
deﬁne it to be described by the quantum model at non-integer times.
The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are
2π
3 δt n , with n = 0, 1, 2 , see Fig. 1 b . This is
reminiscent of an atom with spin one that undergoes a Zeeman splitting due to a homo-
geneous magnetic ﬁeld. One may conclude that such an atom is actually a deterministic
system with three states, or, a cogwheel, but only if the ‘proper’ basis has been identiﬁed.
The reader may remark that this is only true if, somehow, observations faster than
the time scale δt are excluded. We can also rephrase this. To be precise, a Zeeman atom
is a system that needs only 3 (or some other integer N ) states to characterise it. These
are the states it is in at three (or N ) equally spaced moments in time. It returns to itself
after the period T = Nδt .
2.2.1.
Generalisations of the cogwheel model: cogwheels with N teeth
The ﬁrst generalisation of the cogwheel model (section 2.2) is the system that permutes
N ‘ontological’ states |n⟩ont , with n = 0, · · · N −1 , and N some positive integer > 1 .
Assume that the evolution law is that, at the beat of the clock,
|n⟩ont →|n + 1 mod N⟩ont .
(2.20)
This model can be regarded as the universal description of any system that is periodic
with a period of N steps in time. The states in this evolution equation are regarded as
‘ontological’ states. The model does not say anything about ontological states in between
the integer time steps. We call this the simple periodic cogwheel model with period N .
As a generalisation of what was done in the previous section, we perform a discrete
Fourier transformation on these states:
|k⟩H
def

1
√
N
N−1

n=0
e2πikn/N|n⟩ont ,
k = 0, · · · N −1 ;
(2.21)
|n⟩ont
=
1
√
N
N−1
X
k=0
e−2πikn/N|k⟩H .
(2.22)
Normalising the time step δt to one, we have
Uop(1) |k⟩H =
1
√
N
N−1
X
n=0
e2πikn/N|n + 1 mod N⟩ont = e−2πik/N|k⟩H ,
(2.23)
25

and we can conclude
Uop(1) = e−iHop ;
Hop|k⟩H = 2πk
N |k⟩H .
(2.24)
This Hamiltonian is restricted to have eigenvalues in the interval [0, 2π) .
where the
notation means that 0 is included while 2π is excluded. Actually, its deﬁnition implies
that the Hamiltonian is periodic with period 2π , but in most cases we will treat it as
being deﬁned to be restricted to within the interval. The most interesting physical cases
will be those where the time interval is very small, for instance close to the Planck time,
so that the highest eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian will be considered unimportant in
practice.
In the original, ontological basis, the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are

(2.26)
Note that, unlike Eq. (2.8), this equation includes the corrections needed for the ground
state. For the other energy eigenstates, one can check that Eq. (2.26) agrees with Eq. (2.8).
For later use, Eqs. (2.26) and (2.8), without the ground state correction when U(t)|ψ⟩=
|ψ⟩, can be generalised to the form
Hop = C −πi

(2.27)
where C is a (large) constant, T is the period, and tn = n δt is the set of times where
the operator U(tn) is required to have some deﬁnite value. We note that this is a sum,
not an integral, so when the time values are very dense, the Hamiltonian tends to become
very large. There seems to be no simple continuum limit. Nevertheless, in part II, we will
attempt to construct a continuum limit, and see what happens (section 13).
Again, if we impose the Schr¨odinger equation
d
dt|ψ⟩t = −iHop|ψ⟩t and the boundary
condition |ψ⟩t=0 = |n0⟩ont , then this state obeys the deterministic evolution law (2.20)
at integer times t . If we take superpositions of the states |n⟩ont with the Born rule
interpretation of the complex coeﬃcients, then the Schr¨odinger equation still correctly
describes the evolution of these Born probabilities.
It is of interest to note that the energy spectrum (2.24) is frequently encountered in
physics: it is the spectrum of an atom with total angular momentum J =
1
2(N −1)
and magnetic moment µ in a weak magnetic ﬁeld: the Zeeman atom. We observe that,
after the discrete Fourier transformation (2.21), a Zeeman atom may be regarded as
26

the simplest deterministic system that hops from one state to the next in discrete time
intervals, visiting N states in total.
As in the Zeeman atom, we may consider the option of adding a ﬁnite, universal
quantity δE to the Hamiltonian. It has the eﬀect of rotating all states with the complex
amplitude e−i δE after each time step. For a simple cogwheel, this might seem to be an
innocuous modiﬁcation, with no eﬀect on the physics, but below we shall see that the
eﬀect of such an added constant might become quite signiﬁcant later.
Note that, if we introduce any kind of perturbation on the Zeeman atom, causing the
energy levels to be split in intervals that are no longer equal, it will no longer look like a
cogwheel. Such systems will be a lot more diﬃcult to describe in a deterministic theory;
they must be seen as parts of a much more complex world.
2.2.2.
The most general deterministic, time reversible, ﬁnite model
Figure 2: Example of a more generic ﬁnite, deterministic, time reversible model
Generalising the ﬁnite models discussed earlier in this chapter, consider now a model
with a ﬁnite number of states, and an arbitrary time evolution law. Start with any state
|n0⟩ont , and follow how it evolves. After some ﬁnite number, say N0 , of time steps, the
system will be back at |n0⟩ont . However, not all states |n⟩ont may have been reached.
So, if we start with any of the remaining states, say |n1⟩ont , then a new series of states
will be reached, and the periodicity might be a diﬀerent number, N1 . Continue until all
existing states of the model have been reached. We conclude that the most general model
will be described as a set of simple periodic cogwheel models with varying periodicities,
but all working with the same universal time step δt , which we could normalise to one;
see Fig. 2.
Fig. 3 shows the energy levels of a simple periodic cogwheel model (left), a combination
of simple periodic cogwheel models (middle), and the most general deterministic, time
reversible, ﬁnite model (right). Note that we now shifted the energy levels of all cogwheels
by diﬀerent amounts δEi . This is allowed because the index i , telling us which cogwheel

we are in, is a conserved quantity; therefore these shifts have no physical eﬀect.
We
do observe the drastic consequences however when we combine the spectra into one, see
Fig. 3 c .
Fig. 3 clearly shows that the energy spectrum of a ﬁnite discrete deterministic model
can quickly become quite complex13. It raises the following question: given any kind
of quantum system, whose energy spectrum can be computed. Would it be possible to
identify a deterministic model that mimics the quantum model? To what extent would
one have to sacriﬁce locality when doing this? Are there classes of deterministic theories
that can be mapped on classes of quantum models? Which of these would be potentially
interesting?
3.
Interpreting quantum mechanics
This book will not include an exhaustive discussion of all proposed interpretations of what
quantum mechanics actually is. Existing approaches have been described in excessive
detail in the literature [10][12][18][31][55], but we think they all contain weaknesses. The
most conservative attitude is the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation. It is also a very
pragmatic one, and some mainstream researchers insist that it contains all we need to
know about quantum mechanics.
13It should be self-evident that the models displayed in the ﬁgures, and subsequently discussed, are
just simple examples; the real universe will be inﬁnitely more complicated than these. One critic of our
work was confused: “Why this model with 31 states? What’s so special about the number 31?” Nothing,
of course, it is just an example to illustrate how the math works.
28

Yet it is the things that are not explained in the Copenhagen picture that often capture
our attention. Below, we begin with indicating how the cellular Automaton interpretation
will address some of these questions.
3.1.
The Copenhagen Doctrine
It must have been a very exciting period of early modern science, when researchers be-
gan to understand how to handle quantum mechanics, in the late 1920s and subsequent
years. [44] The ﬁrst coherent picture of how one should think of quantum mechanics, is
what we now shall call the Copenhagen Doctrine. In the early days, physicists were still
struggling with the equations and the technical diﬃculties. Today, we know precisely how
to handle all these, so that now we can rephrase the original starting points much more
accurately. Originally, quantum mechanics was formulated in terms of wave functions,
with which one referred to the states electrons are in; ignoring spin for a moment, they
were the functions ψ(⃗x, t) = ⟨⃗x |ψ(t)⟩. Now, we may still use the words ‘wave function’
when we really mean to talk of ket states in more general terms.
Leaving aside who said exactly what in the 1920s, here are the main points of what
one might call the Copenhagen Doctrine. Somewhat anachronistically, we employ Dirac’s
notation:
A system is completely described by its ‘wave function’ |ψ(t)⟩, which is an
element of Hilbert space, and any basis in Hilbert space can be used for its
description. This wave function obeys a linear ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation
in time, to be referred to as Schr¨odinger’s equation, of which the exact form
can be determined by repeated experiments.
A measurement can be made using any observable O that one might want
to choose (observables are hermitean operators in Hilbert space). The theory
then predicts the average measured value of O , after many repetitions of the
experiment, to be
⟨O⟩= ⟨ψ(t)|O|ψ(t)⟩.
(3.1)
As soon as the measurement is made, the wave function of the system collapses
to a state in the subspace of Hilbert space that is an eigenstate of the observ-
able O , or a probabilistic distribution of eigenstates, according to Eq. (3.1).
When two observables O1 and O2 do not commute, they cannot both be mea-
sured accurately. The commutator [O1, O2] indicates how large the product
of the ‘uncertainties’ δO1 and δO2 should be expected to be.
The measuring device itself must be regarded as a classical object, and for
large systems the quantum mechanical measurement approaches closely the
classical description.
Implicitly included in Eq. (3.1) is the element of probability.
If we expand the wave
function |ψ⟩into eigenstates |ϕ⟩of an observable O , then we ﬁnd that the probability
29

that the experiment on |ψ⟩actually gives as a result that the eigenvalue of the state |ϕ⟩
is found, will be given by P = |⟨ϕ|ψ⟩|2 . This is referred to as Born’s probability rule [2].
We note that the wave function may not be given any ontological signiﬁcance. The
existence of a ‘pilot wave’ is not demanded; one cannot actually measure ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩itself;
only by repeated experiments, one can measure the probabilities, with intrinsic margins of
error. We say that the wave function, or more precisely, the amplitudes, are psi-epistemic
rather than psi-ontic.
An important element in the Copenhagen interpretation is that one may only ask
what the outcome of an experiment will be. In particular, it is forbidden to ask: what
is it that is actually happening?
It is exactly the latter question that sparks endless
discussions; the important point made by the Copenhagen group is that such questions
are unnecessary. If one knows the Schr¨odinger equation, one knows everything needed to
predict the outcomes of an experiment, no further questions should be asked.
This is a strong point of the Copenhagen doctrine, but it also yields severe limitations.
If we know the Schr¨odinger equation, we know everything there is to be known.
But what if we do not yet know the Schr¨odinger equation? How does one arrive at
the correct equation? In particular, how do we arrive at the correct Hamiltonian if the
gravitational force is involved?
Gravity has been a major focus point of the last 30 years and more, in elementary
particle theory and the theory of space and time. Numerous wild guesses have been made.
In particular, (super)string theory has made huge advances. Yet no convincing model that
uniﬁes gravity with the other forces has been constructed; models proposed so-far have
not been able to explain, let alone predict, the values of the fundamental constants of
Nature, including the masses of many fundamental particles, the ﬁne structure constant,
and the cosmological constant. And here it is, according to the author’s opinion, where
we do have to ask: What is it, or what could it be, that is actually going on?
One strong feature of the Copenhagen approach to quantum theory was that it was
also clearly shown how a Schr¨odinger equation can be obtained if the classical limit is
known:
If a classical system is described by the (continuous) Hamilton equations, this
means that we have classical variables pi and qi , for which one can deﬁne
Poisson brackets: any pair of observables A(⃗q, ⃗p ) and B(⃗q, ⃗p ) , allow for the
construction of an observable variable called {A, B} , deﬁned by
{A, B} ≡
X
i
∂A
∂qi
∂B
∂pi
−∂A
∂pi
∂B
∂qi

,
(3.2)
in particular:
{qi, pj} = −{pi, qj} = δij ,
{qi, qj} = {pi, pj} = 0 .
(3.3)
A quantum theory is obtained, if we replace the Poisson brackets by commu-
tators, which involves a factor i and a new constant of Nature, ℏ. Basically:
[A, B] →iℏ{A, B} .
(3.4)
30

In the limit ℏ→0 , this quantum theory reproduces the classical system. This very
powerful procedure allows us, more often than not, to bypass the question “what is go-
ing on?”. We have a theory, we know where to search for the appropriate Schr¨odinger
equation, and we know how to recover the classical limit.
Unfortunately, in the case of the gravitational force, this ‘trick’ is not good enough to
give us ‘quantum gravity’. The problem with gravity is not just that the gravitational force
appears not to be renormalizable, or that it is diﬃcult to deﬁne the quantum versions of
space- and time coordinates, and the physical aspects of non-trivial space-time topologies;
some authors attempt to address these problems as merely technical ones, which can be
handled by using some tricks. The real problem is that space-time curvature runs out of
control at the Planck scale. We will be forced to turn to a diﬀerent book keeping system
for Nature’s physical degrees of freedom there.
A promising approach was to employ local conformal symmetry [89] as a more funda-
mental principle than usually thought; this could be a way to make distance and time
scales relative, so that what was dubbed as ‘small distances’ ceases to have an absolute
meaning. The theory is recapitulated in Appendix B. It does need further polishing,
and it too could eventually require a Cellular Automaton interpretation of the quantum
features that it will have to include.
3.2.
The Einsteinian view
This section is called “The Einsteinian view’, rather than ‘Einstein’s view’, because we
do not want to go into a discussion of what it actually was that Einstein thought. It is
well-known that Einstein was uncomfortable with the Copenhagen Doctrine. The notion
that there might be ways to rephrase things such that all phenomena in the universe are
controlled by equations that leave nothing to chance, will now be referred to as the Ein-
steinian view. We do ask further questions, such as Can quantum-mechanical description
of physical reality be considered complete? [6], or, does the theory tell us everything we
might want to know about what is going on?
In the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen discussion of a Gedanken experiment, two particles
(photons, for instance), are created in a state
x1 −x2 = 0 ,
p1 + p2 = 0 .
(3.5)
Since [x1 −x2, p1 +p2] = i−i = 0 , both equations in (3.5) can be simultaneously sharply
imposed.
What bothered Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen was that, long after the two particles
ceased to interact, an observer of particle # 2 might decide either to measure its momen-
tum p2 , after which we know for sure the momentum p1 of particle # 1, or its position
x2 , after which we would know for sure the position x1 of particle #1. How can such
a particle be described by a quantum mechanical wave function at all? Apparently, the
measurement at particle # 2 aﬀected the state of particle #1, but how could that have
happened?
31

In modern quantum terminology, however, we would have said that the measurements
proposed in this Gedanken experiment would have disturbed the wave function of the
entangled particles. The measurements on particle # 2 aﬀects the probability distributions
for particle # 1, which in no way should be considered as the eﬀect of a spooky signal
from one system to the other.
In any case, even Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen had no diﬃculty in computing the
quantum mechanical probabilities for the outcomes of the measurements, so that, in
principle, quantum mechanics emerged unharmed out of this sequence of arguments.
It is much more diﬃcult to describe the two EPR photons in a classical model. Such
questions will be the topic of section 3.6.
Einstein had diﬃculties with the relativistic invariance of quantum mechanics (“does
the spooky information transmitted by these particles go faster than light?”). These,
however, are now seen as technical diﬃculties that have been resolved. It may be consid-
ered part of Copenhagen’s Doctrine, that the transmission of information over a distance
can only take place, if we can identify operators A at space-time point x1 and operators
B at space-time point x2 that do not commute: [A, B] ̸= 0 . We now understand that, in
elementary particle theory, all space-like separated observables mutually commute, which
precludes any signalling faster than light. It is a built-in feature of the Standard Model,
to which it actually owes much of its success.
So, with the technical diﬃculties out of the way, we are left with the more essential
Einsteinian objections against the Copenhagen doctrine for quantum mechanics: it is a
probabilistic theory that does not tell us what actually is going on. It is sometimes even
suggested that we have to put our “classical” sense of logic on hold. Others deny that:
“Keep remembering what you should never ask, while reshaping your sense of logic, and
everything will be ﬁne.” According to the present author, the Einstein-Bohr debate is not
over. A theory must be found that does not force us to redeﬁne any aspect of classical,
logical reasoning.
What Einstein and Bohr did seem to agree about is the importance of the role of an
observer. Indeed, this was the important lesson learned in the 20th century: if something
cannot be observed, it may not be a well-deﬁned concept – it may even not exist at all. We
have to limit ourselves to observable features of a theory. It is an important ingredient
of our present work that we propose to part from this doctrine, at least to some extent:
Things that are not directly observable may still exist and as such play a decisive role
in the observable properties of an object. They may also help us to construct realistic
models of the world.
Indeed, there are big problems with the dictum that everything we talk about must be
observable. While observing microscopic objects, an observer may disturb them, even in
a classical theory; moreover, in gravity theories, observers may carry gravitational ﬁelds
that disturb the system they are looking at, so we cannot aﬀord to make an observer
inﬁnitely heavy (carrying large bags full of “data”, whose sheer weight gravitationally
disturbs the environment), but also not inﬁnitely light (light particles do not transmit
large amounts of data at all), while, if the mass of an observer would be “somewhere in
32

between”, this could entail that our theory will be inaccurate from its very inception.
An interesting blow was given to the doctrine that observability should be central,
when quark theory was proposed. Quarks cannot be isolated to be observed individu-
ally, and for that reason the idea that quarks would be physical particles was attacked.
Fortunately, in this case the theoretical coherence of the evidence in favour of the quarks
became so overwhelming, and experimental methods for observing them, even while they
are not entirely separated, improved so much, that all doubts evaporated.
In short, the Cellular Automaton Interpretation tells us to return to classical logic and
build models. These models describe the evolution of large sets of data, which eventually
may bring about classical phenomena that we can observe.
The fact that these data
themselves cannot be directly observed, and that our experiments will provide nothing
but statistical information, including ﬂuctuations and uncertainties, can be fully explained
within the settings of the models; if the observer takes no longer part in the deﬁnition
of physical degrees of freedom and their values, then his or her limited abilities will no
longer stand in the way of accurate formalisms.
We suspect that this view is closer to Einstein’s than it can be to Bohr, but, in a
sense, neither of them would fully agree. We do not claim the wisdom that our view is
obviously superior, but rather advocate that one should try to follow such paths, and
learn from our successes and failures.
3.3.
Notions not admitted in the C.A.I.
It is often attempted to attach a physical meaning to the wave function beyond what it
is according to Copenhagen. Could it have an ontological signiﬁcance as a ‘pilot wave
function’ [3][10]? It should be clear from nearly every page of this book that we do not
wish to attach any ontological meaning to the wave function, if we are using it as a
template.
In an ontological description of our universe, in terms of its ontological basis, there
are only two values a wave function can take: 1 and 0. A state is actually realised when
the wave function is 1, and it does not describe our world when the wave function is zero.
It is only this ‘universal wave function’, that for that reason may be called ontological.
It is only for mathematical reasons that one might subsequently want to equip this
wave function with a phase, eiϕ . In the ontological basis, this phase ϕ has no physical
meaning at all, but as soon as one considers operators, including the time-evolution op-
erator U(t) , and therefore also the Hamiltonian, these phases have to be chosen. From
a physical point of view, any phase is as good as any other, but for keeping the mathe-
matical complexity under control, precise deﬁnitions of these phases is crucial. One can
then perform the unitary transformations to any of the basis choices usually employed
in physics. The template states subsequently introduced, all come with precisely deﬁned
phases.
A semantic complication is caused as soon as we apply second quantisation. Where
a single particle state is described by a wave function, the second-quantized version of
33

the theory sometimes replaces this by an operator ﬁeld. Its physical meaning is then
completely diﬀerent. Operator ﬁelds are usually not ontological since they are superim-
posables rather than beables (see subsection 2.1.1), but in principle they could be; wave
functions, in contrast, are elements of Hilbert space and as such should not be confused
with operators, let alone beable operators.
How exactly to phrase the so-called ‘Many World Interpretation’ [12] of quantum me-
chanics, is not always agreed upon [21]. When doing ordinary physics with atoms and
elementary particles, this interpretation may well fulﬁl the basic needs of a researcher,
but from what has been learned in this book it should be obvious that our theory con-
trasts strongly with such ideas. There is only one single world that is being selected out
in our theory as being ‘the real world’, while all others simply are not realised.
The reader may have noticed that the topic in this book is being referred to alternately
as a ‘theory’ and as an ‘interpretation’. The theory we describe consists not only of the
assumption that an ontological basis exists, but also that it can be derived, so as to provide
an ontological description of our universe. It suggests pathways to pin down the nature of
this ontological basis. When we talk of an interpretation, this means that, even if we ﬁnd
it hard or impossible to identify the ontological basis, the mere assumption that one might
exist suﬃces to help us understand what the quantum mechanical expressions normally
employed in physics, are actually standing for, and how a physical reality underlying them
can be imagined.
3.4.
The collapsing wave function and Schr¨odinger’s cat
The following ingredient in the Copenhagen interpretation, section 3.1, is often the subject
of discussions:
As soon as an observable O is measured, the wave function of the system
collapses to a state in the subspace of Hilbert space that is an eigenstate of the
observable O , or a probabilistic distribution of eigenstates.
This is referred to as the “collapse of the wave function”. It appears as if the action of the
measurement itself causes the wave function to attain its new form. The question then
asked is what physical process is associated to that.
Again, the oﬃcial reply according to the Copenhagen doctrine is that this question
should not be asked. Do the calculation and check your result with the experiments. How-
ever, there appears to be a contradiction, and this is illustrated by Erwin Schr¨odinger’s
Gedanken experiment with a cat. [8] The experiment is summarised as follows:
In a sealed box, one performs a typical quantum experiment. It could be a
Stern Gerlach experiment where a spin 1
2 particle with spin up is sent through
an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld that splits the wave function according to
the values of the spin in the y direction, or it could be a radioactive atom
that has probability
1
2 to decay within a certain time. In any case, the wave
34

function is well speciﬁed at t = 0 , while at t = 1 it is in a superposition
of two states, which are sent to a detector that determines which of the two
states is realised. It is expected that the wave function ‘collapses’ into one of
the two possible ﬁnal states.
The box also contains a live cat (and air for the cat to breathe). Depending
on the outcome of the measurement, a capsule with poison is broken, or kept
intact. The cat dies when one state is found, and otherwise the cat stays alive.
At the end of the experiment, we open the box and inspect the cat.
Clearly, the probability that we ﬁnd a dead cat is about
1
2 , and otherwise we ﬁnd a live
cat. However, we could also regard the experiment from a microscopic point of view. The
initial state was a pure quantum state. The ﬁnal state is a superposition. Should the cat,
together with the other remains of the experiment, upon opening the box, not be found
in a superimposed state: dead and alive?
The collapse axiom tells us that the state should be ‘dead cat’ or ‘live cat’, whereas the
ﬁrst parts of our description of the quantum mechanical states of Hilbert space, clearly
dictates that if two states, |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩are possible in a quantum system, then we
can also have α|ψ1⟩+ β|ψ2⟩. According to Schr¨odinger’s equation, this superposition of
states always evolves into a superposition of the ﬁnal states. The collapse seems to violate
Schr¨odinger’s equation. Something is not quite right.
An answer that several investigators have studied [33], is that, apparently, Schr¨odinger’s
equation is only an approximation, and that tiny non-linear ‘correction terms’ bring about
the collapse [38][53][54]. One of the problems with this is that observations can be made
at quite diﬀerent scales of space, time, energy and mass. How big should the putative
correction terms be? Secondly, how do the correction terms know in advance which mea-
surements we are planning to perform?
This, we believe, is where the cellular automaton interpretation of quantum mechanics
will come to the rescue. It is formulated using no wave function at all, but there are
ontological states instead. It ends up with just one wave function, taking the value 1 if
we have a state the universe is in, and 0 if that state is not realised. There are no other
wave functions, no superposition.
How this explains the collapse phenomenon will be explained in chapter 4. In sum-
mary: quantum mechanics is not the basic theory but a tool to solve the mathematical
equations. This tool works just as well for superimposed states (the templates) as for the
ontological states, but they are not the same thing. The dead cat is in an ontological state
and so is the live one. The superimposed cat solves the equations mathematically in a
perfectly acceptable way, but it does not describe a state that can occur in the real world.
We postpone the precise explanation to chapter 4. It will sound very odd to physicists
who have grown up with standard quantum mechanics, but it does provide the logical
solution to the Schr¨odinger cat paradox.14
14Critical readers will say: Of course, this theory isn’t quantum mechanics, so it doesn’t share any of
its problems. True, but our theory is supposed to generate quantum mechanics, without generating its
associated problems.
35

One may ask what this may imply when we have transformations between ontological
states and template states.
Our experiences tell us that all template states that are
superpositions α|ψ1⟩+ β|ψ2⟩of ontological states, may serve as suitable approximations
describing probabilistic situations in the real world. How can it be that, sometimes, they
do seem to be ontological? The most likely response to that will be that the transformation
does not always have to be entirely local, but in practice may involve many spectator
states in the environment. What we can be sure of is that all ontological states form an
orthonormal set. So, whenever we use α|ψ1⟩+ β|ψ2⟩to describe an ontological state,
there must be other wave functions in the environment which must be chosen diﬀerently
for any distinct pair α and β , such that the entire set that we use to describe physical
situations are always orthonormal.
This should be taken in mind in the next sections where we comment on the Alice and
Bob Gedanken experiments.
3.5.
Decoherence and Born’s probability axiom
The cellular automaton interpretation does away with one somewhat murky ingredient
of the more standard interpretation schemes: the role of ‘decoherence’. It is the argu-
ment often employed to explain why macroscopic systems are never seen in a quantum
superposition. Let |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩be two states a classical system can be in, such as a cat
being dead and a cat being alive. According to Copenhagen, in its pristine form, quantum
mechanics would predict the possibility of a third state, |ψ3⟩= α|ψ1⟩+ β|ψ2⟩, where α
and β can be any pair of complex numbers with |α|2 + |β|2 = 1 .
Indeed, it seems almost inevitable that a system that can evolve into state |ψ1⟩or
into state |ψ2⟩, should also allow for states that evolve into |ψ3⟩. Why do we not observe
such states? The only thing we do observe is a situation whose probability of being in
|ψ1⟩might be |α|2 and the probability to be in |ψ2⟩is |β|2 . But that is not the same
as state |ψ3⟩.
The argument is that, somehow, the state |ψ3⟩is unstable. According to Copenhagen,
the probability of a state |ψ⟩to be in state |ψ3⟩is
P3 = |⟨ψ3|ψ⟩|2 = |α|2|⟨ψ1|ψ⟩|2 + |β|2|⟨ψ2|ψ⟩|2 + 2Re

α∗β⟨ψ|ψ1⟩⟨ψ2|ψ⟩

.
(3.6)
The last term here is the interference term. It distinguishes the real quantum theory from
classical theories. Now it is said that, if |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩become classical, they cannot stay
immune for interactions with the environment. In the presence of such interactions, the
energies of |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩will not exactly match, and consequently, the interference term,
will oscillate badly. This term might then be seen to average out to zero. The ﬁrst two
terms are just the probabilities to have either |ψ1⟩or |ψ2⟩, which would be the classical
probabilities.
If indeed the last term becomes unobservable, we say that the two states deco-
here [45][54], so that the interference term should be replaced by zero.
The question
is, if we include the environment in our description, the energies should still be exactly
36

conserved, and there is no rapid oscillation. Is it legal to say nevertheless that the inter-
ference term will disappear? Note that its absolute value on average does remain large.
The CAI will give a much more direct answer: if states |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩are classical,
then they are ontological states. State |ψ3⟩will then not be an ontological state, and
the states of the real universe, describing what happens if an actual experiment is carried
out, never include state |ψ3⟩. It is merely a template, useful for calculations, but not
describing reality. What it may describe is a situation where, from the very start, the
coeﬃcients α and β were declared to represent probabilities.
Copenhagen quantum mechanics contains an apparently irreducible axiom: the prob-
ability that a state |ψ⟩is found to agree with the properties of another state |ϕ⟩, must
be given by
P = |⟨ϕ|ψ⟩|2 .
(3.7)
This is the famous Born rule [2]. What is the physical origin of this axiom?
Note, that Born did not have much of a choice. The completeness theorem of linear
algebra implies that the eigenstates |ϕ⟩of an hermitean operator span the entire Hilbert
space, and therefore,
X
ϕ
|ϕ⟩⟨ϕ| = I ;
X
ϕ
|⟨ϕ|ψ⟩|2 =
X
ϕ
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩⟨ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1 ,
(3.8)
where I stands for the identity operator. If Born would have chosen any other expression
to represent probabilities, according to Gleason’s theorem [13], they would not have added
up to one. The expression (3.7) turns out to be ideally suited to serve as a probability.
Yet this is a separate axiom, and the question why it works so well is not misplaced.
In a hidden variable theory, probabilities may have a diﬀerent origin. The most natural
explanation as to why some states are more probable than others may be traced to
their initial states much earlier in time.
One can ask which initial states may have
lead to a state seen at present, and how probable these may have been. There may be
numerous answers to that question. One now could attempt to estimate their combined
probabilities. The relative probabilities of some given observed ﬁnal states could then be
related to the ratios of the numbers found. Our question then is, can we explain whether
and how the expression (3.7) is related to these numbers? This discussion is continued in
subsection 3.6.1 and in section 4.3.
3.6.
Bell’s theorem, Bell’s inequalities and the CHSH inequality.
One of the main reasons why ‘hidden variable’ theories are usually dismissed, and em-
phatically so when the theory obeys local equations, is the apparent diﬃculty in such
theories to represent entangled quantum states. Just because the De Broglie-Bohm the-
ory (not further discussed here) is intrinsically non-local, it is generally concluded that
all hidden variable theories are either non-local or unable to reproduce quantum features
at all. When J.S. Bell was investigating the possibility of hidden variable theories, he hit
37

upon the same diﬃculties, upon which he attempted to prove that local hidden variable
theories are impossible.
As before, we do not intend to follow precisely the historical development of Bell’s
theory [31], but limit ourselves to a summary of the most modern formulation of the
principles.
Bell designed a Gedanken experiment, and at the heart of it is a pair of
quantum-entangled particles.
They could be spin- 1
2 particles, which each can be in
just two quantum states described by the Pauli matrices (1.7), or alternatively spin 1
photons. There are a few subtle diﬀerences between these two cases, although these are
not essential to the argument. The ﬁrst is that the two orthonormal states for photons are
the ones where they are polarised horizontally or vertically, while the two spin- 1
2 states
are polarised up or down. Indeed, quite generally when polarised particles are discussed,
the angles for the photons are handled as being half the angles for spin- 1
2 particles.
The second diﬀerence concerns the entangled state, which in both cases has total
spin 0. For spin- 1
2 , this means that (⃗σ1 + ⃗σ2)|ψ⟩= 0 , where ⃗σ are the Pauli matrices,
Eqs. (1.7), so that
|ψ⟩=
1
√
2(| ↑↓⟩−| ↓↑⟩) ,
(3.9)
which means that the two electrons are polarised in opposite directions.
For spin 1, this is diﬀerent. Let us have these photons move in the ±z -direction.
Deﬁning A± =
1
√
2(Ax ± iAy) as the operators that create or annihilate one unit of spin
in the z -direction, and taking into account that photons are bosons, the 2 photon state
with zero spin in the z -direction is
|ψ⟩=
1
√
2(A(1)

−A(2)
+ ) | ⟩=
1
√
2 |z, −z⟩+
1
√
2| −z, z⟩,
(3.10)
and since helicity is spin in the direction of motion, while the photons go in opposite
directions, we can rewrite this state as
|ψ⟩=
1
√
2( | + +⟩+ | −−⟩) ,
(3.11)
where ± denote the helicities. Alternatively one can use the operators Ax and Ay to
indicate the creators of linearly polarised photons, and then we have
|ψ⟩=
1
√
2(A(1)
x A(2)
x + A(1)
y A(2)
y ) | ⟩=
1
√
2( |xx⟩+ |yy⟩) .
(3.12)
Thus, the two photons are linearly polarised in the same direction.
Since the experiment is mostly done with photons, we will henceforth describe the
entangled photon state.
The Bell experiment is now illustrated in Fig. 4.
At the point S , an atom ε is
prepared to be in an unstable J = 0 state at t = t1 , such that it can decay only into an
other J = 0 state, by simultaneously emitting two photons such that ∆J = 0 , and the
two photons, α and β , must therefore be in the entangled Stot = 0 state, at t = t2 .
After having travelled for a long time, at t = t3 , photon α is detected by observer A
(Alice), and photon β is detected by B (Bob). Ideally, the observers use a polarisation

ﬁlter oriented at an angle a (Alice) and b (Bob). If the photon is transmitted by the
ﬁlter, it is polarised in the direction of the polarisation ﬁlter’s angle, if it is reﬂected, its
polarisation was orthogonal to this angle. At both sides of the ﬁlter there is a detector, so
both Alice and Bob observe that one of their two detectors gives a signal. We call Alice’s
signal A = +1 if the photon passed the ﬁlter, and A = −1 if it is reﬂected. Bob’s signal
B is deﬁned the same way.
According to quantum theory, if A = 1 , Alice’s photon is polarised in the direction
a , so Bob’s photon must also be polarised in that direction, and the intensity of the
light going through Bob’s ﬁlter will be cos2(a −b) . Therefore, according to quantum
theory, the probability that B = 1 is cos2(a −b) . The probability that B = −1 is then
sin2(a −b) , and the same reasoning can be set up if A = −1 . The expectation value of
the product AB is thus found to be
⟨A B ⟩= cos2(a −b) −sin2(a −b) = cos 2(a −b) ,
(3.13)
according to quantum mechanics.
In fact, these correlation functions can now be checked experimentally.
Beautiful
experiments [32] conﬁrmed that correlations can come close to Eq. (3.13).
The point made by Bell is that it seems to be impossible to reproduce this strong
correlation between the ﬁndings A and B in any theory where classical information is
passed on from the atom ε to Alice (A) and Bob (B). All one needs to assume is that the
atom emits a signal to Alice and one to Bob, regarding the polarisation of the photons
emitted. It could be the information that both photons α and β are polarised in direction
c . Since this information is emitted long before either Alice or Bob decided how to orient
their polarisation ﬁlters, it is obvious that the signals in α and β should not depend on
that. Alice and Bob are free to choose their polarisers.
39

The correlations then directly lead to a contradiction, regardless the nature of the
classical signals used. The contradiction is arrived at as follows. Consider two choices
that Alice can make: the angles a and a ′ . Similarly, Bob can choose between angles
b and b ′ .
Whatever the signal is that the photons carry along, it should entail an
expectation value for the four observations that can be made: Alice observes A or A′ in
the two cases, and Bob observes B or B′ . If both Alice and Bob make large numbers
of observations, every time using either one of their two options, they can compare notes
afterwards, and measure the averages of AB , A′ B , AB′ , and A′ B′ . They calculate
the value of
S = ⟨AB⟩+ ⟨A′ B⟩+ ⟨A B′ ⟩−⟨A′ B′ ⟩,
(3.14)
and see how it depends on the polarisation angles a and b .
Now suppose we assume that, every time photons are emitted, they have well-deﬁned
values for A, A′, B , and B′ . Whatever the signals are that are carried by the photons,
at each measurement these four terms will take the values ±1 , but they can never all
contribute to the quantity S with the same sign (because of the one minus sign in (3.14)).
Because of this, it is easy to see that S is always ±2 , and its average value will therefore
obey:
|⟨S⟩| ≤2 ;
(3.15)
this modern version of Bell’s original observation is called the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-
Holt (CHSH) inequality [20]. However, if we choose the angles
a = 22.5◦,
a′ = −22.5◦,
b = 0◦,
b′ = 45◦,
(3.16)
then, according to Eq. (3.13), quantum mechanics gives for the expectation value
S = 3 cos(45◦) −cos 135◦= 2
√
2 > 2 .
(3.17)
How can this be? Apparently, quantum mechanics does not give explicit values ±1 for
the measurements of A and A′ ; it only gives a value to the quantity actually measured,
which in each case is either A or A′ and also either B or B′ . If Alice measures A ,
she cannot also measure A′ because the operator for A′ does not commute with A ; the
polarisers diﬀer by an angle of 45◦, and a photon polarised along one of these angles
is a quantum superposition of a photon polarised along the other angle and a photon
polarised orthogonally to that. So the quantum outcome is completely in accordance
with the Copenhagen prescriptions, but it seems that it cannot be realised in a local
hidden variable theory.
We say that, if A is actually measured, the measurement of A′ is counterfactual,
which means that we imagine measuring A′ but we cannot actually do it, just as we
are unable to measure position if we already found out what exactly the momentum of
a particle is. If two observables do not commute, one can measure one of them, but the
measurement of the other is counterfactual.
40

Indeed, in the arguments used, it was assumed that the hidden variable theory should
allow an observer actually to carry out counterfactual measurements. This is called deﬁ-
niteness. Local hidden variable theories that allow for counterfactual observations are said
to have local deﬁniteness. Quantum mechanics forbids local counterfactual deﬁniteness.
However, to use the word ‘deﬁniteness’, or ‘realism’, for the possibility to perform
counterfactual observations is not very accurate.
‘realism’ should mean that there is
actually something happening, not a superposition of things; something is happening for
sure, while something else is not happening. That is not the same thing as saying that
both Alice and Bob at all times can choose to modify their polarisation angles, without
allowing for any modiﬁcation at other places [63].
It is here that the notion of “free will” is introduced [58][59], again, in an imprecise
manner15. The real extra assumption made by Bell, and more or less tacitly by many
of his followers, is that both Alice and Bob should have the “free will” to modify their
settings at any moment, without having to consult the settings at the system S that
produces an unstable atom. If this were allowed to happen in a hidden variable theory,
we would get local counterfactual deﬁniteness, which was ruled out.
The essence of the argument that now follows has indeed been raised before. The
formulation by C.H. Brans [40] is basically correct, but we add an extra twist, something
to be called the ‘ontology conservation law’, in order to indicate why violation of Bell’s
theorem does not require ‘absurd physics’.
How can we deny Alice and/or Bob their free will? Well, precisely in a deterministic
hidden variable theory, Alice and Bob can only change their minds about the setting of
their polarisers, if their brains follow diﬀerent laws than they did before, and, like it or
not, Alice’s and Bob’s actions are determined by laws of physics [84], even if these are
only local laws. Their decisions, logically, have their roots in the distant past, going back
all the way to the Big Bang. So why should we believe that they can do counterfactual
observations?
The way this argument is usually countered is that the correlations between the pho-
tons c from the decaying atom and the settings a and b chosen by Alice and Bob have
to be amazingly strong. A gigantically complex algorithm could make Alice an Bob take
their decisions, and yet the decaying atom, long before Alice and Bob applied this algo-
rithm, knew about the result. This is called ‘conspiracy’, and conspiracy is said to be
“disgusting”. “One could better stop doing physics than believe such a weird thing”, is
what several investigators quipped.
In subsections 3.6.2, 5.7.3 and 10.3.3, we go to the core of this issue.
15One can certainly attempt to deﬁne ‘free will’ in terms of sound mathematical physics. See Part II,
subsection 10.3.4.

3.6.1.
The mouse dropping function
To illustrate how crazy things can get, a polished version of Bell’s experiment was pro-
posed: both Alice and Bob carry along with them a mouse in a cage16, with food. Every
time they want to set the angles of their polarisers, they count the number of mouse drop-
pings. If it is even, they choose one angle, if it is odd, they choose the other. “Now, the
decaying atom has to know ahead of time how many droppings the mouse will produce.
Isn’t this disgusting?”
To see what is needed to obtain this “disgusting” result, let us consider a simple model.
We assume that there are correlations between the joint polarisations of the two entangled
photons, called c , and the settings a chosen by Alice and b chosen by Bob. All these
angles are taken to be in the interval [0, 180◦] . We deﬁne the conditional probability to
have the photons polarised in the direction c , given a and b , to be given by a function
W(c | a, b) .
Next, assume that Alice’s outcome A = +1 as soon as her ‘ontological’
photon has |a −c| < 45◦or > 135◦, otherwise A = −1 .
For Bob’s measurement,
replacing a ↔b , we assume the same.
To see how the CHSH inequality gets violated, consider the probability W(c|a, b) of
the angle c when a and b are given. We now compute this assuming the quantum me-
chanical result is right. Everything will be periodic in a, b, and c with period π (180◦).
It is reasonable to expect that W only depends on the relative angles c−a and c−b .
W(c | a, b) = W(c −a, c −b) ;
Z π
0
dc W(c −a, c −b) = 1 .
(3.18)
Introduce a sign function s(ϕ) as follows:17
s(ϕ) ≡sign(cos(2ϕ)) ;
A = s(c−a) ,
B = s(c−b) .
(3.19)
The expectation value of the product AB is
⟨A B⟩=
Z
dc W(c | a, b) s(c−a) s(c−b) ,
(3.20)
How should W be chosen so as to reproduce the quantum expression (3.13)?
Introduce the new variables
x = c −1
2(a + b) ,
z = 1
2(b −a) ,
W = W(x + z, x −z) .
(3.21)
Quantum mechanics demands that
Z π
0
dx W(x + z, x −z) s(x+z) s(x−z) = cos 4z .
(3.22)
16This version was brought forward in a blog discussion. Unfortunately, I do not remember who raised
it.
17We use the brackets in subscript so as to avoid confusion with simple multiplications in our subsequent
calculations.
42

Writing
s(x+z) s(x−z) = sign(cos 2(x + z) cos 2(x −z)) = sign(cos 4x + cos 4z) ,
(3.23)
we see that the equations are periodic with period π/2 , but looking more closely, we
see that both sides of Eq. (3.22) change sign if x and z are shifted by an amount
π/4 . Therefore, one ﬁrst tries solutions with periodicity π/4 . Furthermore, we have the
symmetry x ↔−x, z ↔−z .
Eq. (3.22) contains more unknowns than equations, but if we assume W only to
depend on x but not on z then the equation can readily be solved.
Diﬀerentiating
Eq. (3.22) to z , one only gets Dirac delta functions inside the integral, all adding up to
yield:
4
Z π/4
0
W(x)dx(−2δ(x + z −π/4)) = −4 sin 4z ,
if 0 < z < 1
4π
(3.24)
(the four parts of the integral in Eq. (3.22) each turn out to give the same contribution,
hence the ﬁrst factor 4). Thus one arrives at
W(c | a, b) = W(x + z, x −z) =
1
2| sin 4x| =
1
2| sin(4c −2a −2b) | .
(3.25)
This also yields a normalised 3-point probability distribution,
W(a, b, c) =
1
2π2| sin(4c −2a −2b)| .
(3.26)
By inspection, we ﬁnd that this correlation function W indeed leads to the quantum
expression (3.13).
We could call this the ‘mouse dropping function’ (see Fig. 5).
If
Alice wants to perform a counterfactual measurement, she modiﬁes the angle a , while b
and c are kept untouched. She herewith chooses a conﬁguration that is less probable,
or more probable, than the conﬁguration she had before.
Taking in mind a possible
interpretation of the Born probabilities, as expressed in sections 3.5 and 4.3, this means
that the conﬁguration of initial states where Alice’s mouse produced a diﬀerent number
of droppings, may be more probable or less probable than the state she had before. In
quantum mechanics, we have learned that this is acceptable. If we say this in terms of an
underlying deterministic theory, there seem to be problems with it.

3.6.2.
Ontology conservation and hidden information
In fact, all we have stated here is that, even in a deterministic theory obeying local equa-
tions, conﬁgurations of template states may have non-trivial space-like correlations. It is
known that this happens in many physical systems. A liquid close to its thermodynam-
ical critical point shows a phenomenon called critical opalescence: large ﬂuctuations in
the local density. This means that the density correlation functions are non-trivial over
relatively large space-like distances. This does not entail a violation of relativity theory
or any other principle in physics such as causality; it is a normal phenomenon. A liquid
does not have to be a quantum liquid to show critical opalescence.
It is still true that the eﬀect of the mouse droppings seems to be mysterious, since,
in a sense, we do deny that Alice, Bob, and their mice have “free will”. What exactly
is ‘free will’? We prefer a mathematical deﬁnition rather than an emotional one (see
subsection 10.3.4), and we also return to this subject, in our ﬁnal discussion in sections 10.2
and 10.3. All we can bring forward now is that mice guts also obey energy, momentum and
angular momentum conservation because these are general laws. In our ‘hidden variable’
theory, a general law will have to be added to this: an ontological state evolves into
an ontological state; superpositions evolve into superpositions. If the mouse droppings
are ontological in one description and counterfactual in another, the initial state from
which they came was also ontological or counterfactual, accordingly. This should not be
a mysterious statement.
There is a problematic element in this argument however, which is that, somehow,
the entangled photons leaving the source, already carry information about the settings
that will be used by Alice and Bob.
They don’t tell us the settings themselves, but
they do carry information about the correlation function of these settings. Thus, non-
local information about the future is already present in the ‘hidden’ ontological data of
the photons, information that disappears when we rephrase what happens in terms of
standard quantum mechanical descriptions. Thus, there is non-trivial information about
the future in the ontological description of what happens. We claim that, as long as this
information is subject to a rigorous conservation law – the law of the conservation of
ontology as described above – there is no contradiction here, but we do suspect that this
may shed at least an unusual light on the idea of superdeterminism.
Actually, there is an even stronger arrangement than the mouse droppings by which
Alice and Bob can make their decisions. They could both monitor the light ﬂuctuations
caused by light coming from diﬀerent quasars, at opposite points in the sky [64], and use
these to decide about the settings a and b of their ﬁlters. These quasars, called QA and
QB in Fig. 4, may have emitted their photons shortly after the Big Bang, at time t = t0
in the Figure, when they were at billions of light years separation from one another. The
ﬂuctuations of these quasars should also obey the mouse dropping formula (3.25). How
can this be? The only possible explanation is the one oﬀered by the inﬂation theory of the
early universe: these two quasars, together with the decaying atom, do have a common
past, and therefore their light is correlated.
Note that the correlation generated by the probability distribution (3.26) is a genuine
44

three-body correlation. Integrating over any one of the three variables gives a ﬂat distri-
bution. The quasars are correlated only through the state the decaying atom is in, but
not directly with one another. It clearly is a mysterious correlation, but it is not at odds
with what we know about the laws of physics, see sections 20.6 and 20.7 in part II.
In fact, these space-like correlations must be huge: who knows where else in the
universe some alien Alices and Bobs are doing experiments using the same quasars . . .
4.
Deterministic quantum mechanics
4.1.
Introduction
Most attempts at formulating hidden variable theories in the presently existing literature
consist of some sort of modiﬁcation of the real quantum theory, and of a replacement of
ordinary classical physics by some sort of stochastic formalism. The idea behind this is
always that quantum mechanics seems to be so diﬀerent from the classical regime, that
some deep modiﬁcations of standard procedures seem to be necessary.
In the approach advocated here, what we call deterministic quantum mechanics is
claimed to be much closer to standard procedures than usually thought to be possible.
Deterministic quantum mechanics is neither a modiﬁcation of standard quan-
tum mechanics, nor a modiﬁcation of classical theory. It is a cross section of
the two.
This cross section is claimed to be much larger and promising than usually thought. We
can phrase the theory in two ways: starting from conventional quantum mechanics, or
starting from a completely classical setting. We have seen already in previous parts of
this work what this means; here we recapitulate.
Starting from conventional quantum mechanics, deterministic quantum mechanics is
a small subset of all quantum theories: we postulate the existence of a very special basis
in Hilbert space: the ontological basis. Very likely, there will be many diﬀerent choices for
an ontological basis (often related by symmetry transformations), and it will be diﬃcult
to decide which of these is “the real one”. This is not so much our concern. Any of these
choices for our ontological basis will serve our purpose. Finding quantum theories that
have an ontological basis will be an important and diﬃcult exercise. Our hope is that
this exercise might lead to new theories that could help elementary particle physics and
quantum gravity theories to further develop. Also it may help us ﬁnd special theories of
cosmology.
An ontological basis is a basis in terms of which the Schr¨odinger equation sends basis
elements into other basis elements at suﬃciently dense moments in time.
This deﬁnition is deliberately a bit vague. We do not specify how dense the moments
in time have to be, nor do we exactly specify how time is deﬁned; in special relativity, we
can choose diﬀerent frames of reference where time means something diﬀerent. In general
45

relativity, one has to specify Cauchy surfaces that deﬁne time slices. What really matters
is that an ontological basis allows a meaningful subset of observables to be deﬁned as
operators that are diagonal in this basis. We postulate that they evolve into one another,
and this implies that their eigenvalues remain sharply deﬁned as time continues. Precise
deﬁnitions of an ontological basis will be needed only if we have speciﬁc theories in mind;
in the ﬁrst simple examples that we shall discuss, it will always be clear what this basis
is. In some cases, time is allowed to ﬂow continuously, in others, notably when we have
discrete operators, time is also limited to a discrete subset of a continuous time line.
Once such a basis has been identiﬁed, we may have in our hands a set of observables
in terms of which the time evolution equations appear to be classical equations. This
then links the system to a classical theory. But it was a quantum theory from where we
started, and this quantum theory allows us without much ado to transform to any other
basis we like. Fock space for the elementary particles is such a basis, and it still allows
us to choose any orthonormal sets of wave functions we like for each particle type. In
general, Fock space will not be an ontological basis. We might also wish to consider the
basis spanned by the ﬁeld operators φ(⃗x, t) , Aµ(⃗x, t) , and so on. This will also not be
an ontological basis, in general.
Clearly, an ontological basis for the Standard Model has not yet been found, and it
is very dubious whether anything resembling an ontological basis for the Standard Model
exists. More likely, the model will ﬁrst have to be extended to encompass gravity in
some way. In the mean time, it might be a useful exercise to identify operators that stay
diagonal longer than others, so they may be closer to the ontological variables of the theory
than other operators. In general, this means that we have to investigate commutators of
operators. Can we identify operators that, against all odds, accidentally commute? We
shall see a simple example of such a class of operators when we study our “neutrino”
models (section 15.2 in part II ); “neutrinos” in quotation marks, because these will be
idealised neutrino-like fermions. We shall also see that anything resembling a harmonic
oscillator can be rephrased in an ontological basis to describe classical variables that evolve
periodically, the period being that of the original oscillator (section 13 in part II ).
We shall also see in part II that some of the mappings we shall ﬁnd are not at all
fool-proof. Most of our examples cease to be linked to a classical system if interactions
are turned on, unless one accepts that negative-energy states emerge (section 9.2). Fur-
thermore, we have the so-called edge states. These are states that form a subset of Hilbert
space with measure zero, but their contributions may still spoil the exact correspondence.
Rather than searching for an ontological basis in an existing quantum system, we can
also imagine deﬁning a theory for deterministic quantum mechanics by starting with some
completely classical theory. Particles, ﬁelds, and what not, move around following classical
laws. These classical laws could resemble the classical theories we are already familiar
with: classical mechanics, classical ﬁeld theories such as the Navier Stokes equations, and
so on. There is however also a very interesting class of models usually called “cellular
automata”. A cellular automaton is a system with localised, classical, discrete degrees of
freedom18, typically arranged in a lattice, which obey evolution equations. The evolution
18Besides this, one may also imagine quantum cellular automata. These would be deﬁned by quantum
46

equations take the shape of a computer program, and could be investigated in computers
exactly, by running these programs in a model. A typical feature of a cellular automaton
is that the evolution law for the data in every cell only depends on the data in the adjacent
cells, and not on what happens at larger distances. This is a desirable form of locality,
which indeed ensures that information cannot spread faster than some limiting speed,
usually assumed to be the local speed of light.
In principle, these classical theories may be chosen to be much more general than the
classical models most often used in physics. As we need a stabilisation mechanism, our
classical model will usually be required to obey a Hamiltonian principle, which however,
for discrete theories, takes a shape that diﬀers substantially from the usual Hamiltonian
system, see part II, chapter 19. A very important limitation would then be the demand
of time reversibility. If a classical model is not time reversible, it seems at ﬁrst sight that
our procedures will fail. For instance, we wish our evolution operator to be unitary, so
that the quantum Hamiltonian will turn out to be a hermitean operator. But, as we shall
see, it may be possible to relax even this condition. The Navier Stokes equations, for
instance, although time reversible at short time scales, do seem to dissipate information
away. When a Navier Stokes liquid comes to rest, due to the viscosity terms, it cannot
be followed back in time anymore. Nevertheless, time non reversible systems may well be
of interest for our theories anyway, as will be discussed in section 7.
Starting from any classical system, we consider its book keeping procedure, and iden-
tify a basis element for every state the system can be in. These basis elements are declared
to be orthonormal. In this artiﬁcial Hilbert space, the states evolve, and it appears to
be a standard exercise ﬁrst to construct the evolution operator that describes the postu-
lated evolution, and then to identify a quantum Hamiltonian that generates this evolution
operator, by exponentiation.
As soon as we have our Hilbert space, we are free to perform any basis transformation
we like. Then, in a basis where quantum calculations can be done to cover long distances
in space and time, we ﬁnd that the states we originally called “ontological” now indeed
are quantum superpositions of the new basis elements, and as such, they can generate
interference phenomena. The central idea behind deterministic quantum mechanics is,
that at this stage our transformations might tend to become so complex that the original
ontological states can no longer be distinguished from any other superposition of states,
and this is why, in conventional quantum mechanics, we treat them all without distinction.
We lost our ability to identify the ontological states in today’s ‘eﬀective’ quantum theories.
4.2.
The classical limit revisited
Now there are a number of interesting issues to be discussed. One is the act of measure-
ment, and the resulting ‘collapse of the wave function’. What is a measurement? [25]
The answer to this question may be extremely interesting. A measurement allows a
operators (or qubits) inside their cells. These are commonly used as ‘lattice quantum ﬁeld theories’, but
would not, in general, allow for an ontological basis.
47

single bit of information at the quantum level, to evolve into something that can be recog-
nised and identiﬁed at large scales. Information becomes classical if it can be magniﬁed
to arbitrary strength. Think of space ships that react on the commands of a computer,
which in turn may originate in just a few electrons in its memory chips. A single cos-
mic ray might aﬀect these data. The space ship in turn might aﬀect the course of large
systems, eventually forcing planets to alter their orbits, ﬁrst in tiny ways, but then these
modiﬁcations might get magniﬁed.
Now we presented this picture for a reason: we deﬁne measurement as a process that
turns a single bit of information into states where countless many bits and bytes react on
it. Imagine a planet changing its course. Would this be observable in terms of the original,
ontological variables, the beables? It would be very hard to imagine that it would not
be. The interior of a planet may have its ontological observables arranged in a way that
diﬀers ever so slightly from what happens in the vacuum state. Whatever these minute
changes are, the planet itself is so large that the tiny diﬀerences can be added together
statistically so that the classical orbit parameters of a planet will be recognisable in terms
of the original ontological degrees of freedom.
In equations, consider a tiny fraction δV
of the volume V
of a planet. Consider
the ontological variables inside δV
and compare these with the ontological variables
describing a similar volume δV in empty space. Because of the ‘quantum’ ﬂuctuations,
there may be some chance that these variables coincide, but it is hard to imagine that they
will coincide completely. So let the probability P(δV ) that these coincide be somewhat
less than 1, say:
P(δV ) = 1 −ε ,
(4.1)
with a small value for ε > 0 . Then the odds that the planet as a whole is indistinguishable
from the vacuum will be
Ptot = (1 −ε)V/δV ≈e−εV/δV →0 ,
(4.2)
if the volume V of the planet is suﬃciently large. This means that large planets must be
well distinguishable from the vacuum state.
This is a very important point, because it means that, at a large scale, all other classical
observables of our world must also be diagonal in terms of the ontological basis: large
scale observables, such as the orbits of planets, and then of course also the classical data
shown in a detector, are beables. They commute with our microscopic beable operators.
See also Figure 6.
Let us now again address the nature of the wave functions, or states |ψ⟩, that represent
real observed phenomena.
In terms of the basis we would normally use in quantum
mechanics, these states will be complicated quantum superpositions.
In terms of the
original, ontological basis, the beables will just describe the elementary basis elements.
And now what we just argued is that they will also be elementary elements of the classical
observables at large scales! What this means is that the states |ψ⟩that we actually
produce in our laboratories, will automatically collapse into states that are distinguishable
48

classically. There will be no need to modify Schr¨odinger’s equation to realise the collapse
of the wave function; it will happen automatically.
This does away with Schr¨odinger’s cat problem. The cat will deﬁnitely emerge either
dead or alive, but never in a superposition. This is because all states |ψ⟩that we can
ever produce inside the cat-killing machine, are ontological.
When we write them as
superpositions, it is because the exact state, in terms of ontological basis elements, is not
precisely known.
In Schr¨odinger’s Gedanken experiment, the state actually started from was an onto-
logical state, and for that reason could only evolve into either a dead cat or a live cat.
If we would have tried to put the superimposed state, α|dead⟩+ β|alive⟩in our box, we
would not have had an ontological state but just a template state. We can’t produce such
a state! What we can do is repeat the experiment; in our simpliﬁed description of it, using
our eﬀective but not ontological basis, we might have thought to have a superimposed
state as our initial state, but that of course never happens, all states we ever realise in the
lab are the ontological ones, that later will collapse into states where classical observables
take deﬁnite values, even if we cannot always predict these.
In the author’s mind this resolution to the collapse problem, the measurement problem
and the Schr¨odinger cat problem is actually one of the strongest arguments in favour of
the Cellular Automaton Interpretation.
4.3.
Born’s probability rule
4.3.1.
The use of templates
For the approach advocated in this book, the notion of templates was coined, as intro-
duced in section 2.1. We argue that conventional quantum mechanics is arrived at if
we perform some quite complicated basis transformation on the ontological basis states.
These new basis elements so obtained will all be quite complex quantum superpositions
of the ontological states. It is these states that we call “template states”; they are the
recognisable states we normally use in quantum mechanics. It is not excluded that the
transformation may involve non-locality to some extent.
Upon inverting this transformation, one ﬁnds that, in turn, the ontological states will
be complicated superpositions of the template states. The superpositions are complicated
because they will involve many modes that are hardly visible to us. For instance, the
vacuum state, our most elementary template state, will be a superposition of very many
ontic (short for ontological) states. Why this is so, is immediately evident, if we realise
that the vacuum is the lowest eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, while the Hamiltonian is not
a beable but a ‘changeable’ (see subsection 2.1.1). Of course, if this holds for the vacuum
(subsection 5.7.5), it will surely also hold for all other template states normally used.
We know that some ontic states will transform into entangled combinations of templates,
since entangled states can be created in the laboratory.
The macroscopic states, which are the classical states describing people and planets,
but also the pointers of a measuring device, and of course live and dead cats, are again su-

a) The sub-microscopic states are the
“hidden variables”. Atoms, molecules and ﬁelds are templates, deﬁned as quantum
superpositions of the sub-microscopic states, and used at the conventional micro-
scopic scale. The usual “classical” objects, such as planets and people, are macro-
scopic, and again superpositions of the micro-templates. The lines here indicate
quantum matrix elements.
b) The classical, macroscopic states are probabilistic
distributions of the sub-microscopic states. Here, the lines therefore indicate prob-
abilities. All states are astronomical in numbers, but the microscopic templates are
more numerous than the classical states, while the sub-microscopic states are even
more numerous.
perpositions of the template states, in general, but they are usually not inﬁnitely precisely
deﬁned, since we do not observe every atom inside these objects. Each macroscopic state
is actually a composition of very many quantum states, but they are well-distinguishable
from one another.
In Figure 6, the fundamental ontological states are the sub-microscopic ones, then we
see the microscopic states, which are the quantum states we usually consider, that is,
the template states, and ﬁnally the macroscopic or classical states. The matrix elements
relating these various states are indicated by lines of variable thickness.
What was argued in the previous section was that the classical, or macroscopic, states
are diagonal in terms of the sub-microscopic states, so these are all ontic states. It is a
curious fact of Nature that the states that are most appropriate for us to describe atoms,
molecules and sub-atomic particles are the template states, requiring superpositions. So,
when we observe a classical object, we are also looking at ontological things, which is why
a template state we use to describe what we expect to see, “collapses” into delta peeked
probability distributions in terms of the classical states.
In discussions with colleagues the author noticed how surprised they were with the
above statements about classical states being ontological. The reasoning above is however
almost impossible to ignore, and indeed, our simple observation explains a lot about
what we sometimes perceive as genuine ‘quantum mysteries’. So, it became an essential
ingredient of our theory.
50

4.3.2.
Probabilities
At ﬁrst sight, it may seem that the notion of probability is lost in our treatment of
quantum mechanics. Our theory is ontic, it describes certainties, not probabilities.
However, probabilities emerge naturally also in many classical systems. Think of how
a 19th century scientist would look at probabilities. Two beams of particles cross in
an interaction area. How will the particles scatter? Of course, the particles will be too
small to aim them so precisely that we would know in advance exactly how they meet
one another, so we apply the laws of statistics. Without using quantum mechanics, the
19th century scientist would certainly know how to compute the angular distribution of
the scattered particles, assuming some classical interaction potential. The origin of the
statistical nature of the outcome of his calculations is simply traced to the uncertainty
about the initial state.
In conventional quantum mechanics, the initial state may seem to be precisely known:
we have two beams consisting of perfectly planar wave functions; the statistical distri-
bution comes about because the wave functions of the ﬁnal state have a certain shape,
and only there, the quantum physicist would begin to compute amplitudes and deduce
the scattering probabilities from those. So this looks very diﬀerent. We are now going to
explain however, that the origin of the statistics in both cases is identical after all.
In our theory, the transition from the classical notation to the quantum notation takes
place when we decide to use a template state |ψ(t)⟩to describe the state of the system.
At t = 0 , the coeﬃcients |λA|2 , where (see the remarks following Eq. (2.2))
⟨ont(0)A | ψ(0)⟩= λA ,
(4.3)
determine the probability that we are starting with ontological state # A . We then use our
Schr¨odinger equation to determine |ψ(t)⟩. When, at some time t1 , the asymptotic out-
state is reached, we compute ⟨ont(t1)A | ψ(t1)⟩, where now the ontological state represents
the outcome of a particular measurement, say, the particles hitting a detector at some
given angle. According to quantum mechanics, using the Born rule, the absolute square of
this amplitude is the probability of this outcome. But, according to our theory, the initial
ontological states |ont(0)⟩A evolved into ﬁnal ontological states |ont(t1)⟩A , so, we have
to use the same coeﬃcients λA . And now, these determine the probability of the given
outcome. So indeed, we conclude that these probabilities coincide with the probabilities
that we started with given ontological in-states.
The ﬁnal ontological states are the ontological states that lead to a given outcome of the
experiment. Note, that we used superpositions in calculating the transition amplitudes,
but the ﬁnal answers just correspond to the probability that we started with a given
ontological in-state that, with certainty, evolved into a given ﬁnal, classical out-state.
Our template states form a very tiny subset of all ontological states, so that every time
we repeat an experiment, the actual ontic state is a diﬀerent one. The initial template
state now does represent the probabilities of the initial ontic states, and because these
are projected into the classical ﬁnal states, the classical ﬁnal states obey the Born rule if
the initial states do. Therefore, we can prove that our theory obeys the Born rule if we
51

know that the initial state does that regarding the ontic modes. If we now postulate that
the template states used always reﬂect the relative probabilities of the ontic states of the
theory, then the Born rule appears to be an inevitable consequence. [90]
Most importantly, there is absolutely no reason to attempt to incorporate deviations
from Born’s probability interpretation of the Copenhagen interpretation into our theory.
Born’s rule will be exactly obeyed; there cannot be systematic, reproducible deviations.
Thus, we argue, Born’s rule follows from our requirement that the basis of template states
that we use is related to the basis of ontological states by an orthonormal, or unitary,
transformation.
Thus, we derived that: as long as we use orthonormal transformations to go from one
basis to another, Born’s rule, including the use of absolute squares to represent probabili-
ties, is the only correct expression for these probabilities.

Concise description of the CA Interpretation
Of course we assume that the reader is familiar with the ‘Schr¨odinger representation’ as
well as the ‘Heisenberg representation’ of conventional quantum mechanics. We often use
these intermittently.
5.1.
Time reversible cellular automata
The Cogwheel Model, which, as described in section 2.2, can be mapped on a Zeeman
atom with equally spaced energy levels. It is the prototype of an automaton. All our
deterministic models can be characterised as ‘automata’.
A cellular automaton is an
automaton where the data are imagined to form a discrete, d -dimensional lattice, in an
n = d + 1 dimensional space-time. The elements of the lattice are called ‘cells’, and each
cell can contain a limited amount of information. The data Q(⃗x, t) in each cell (⃗x, t)
could be represented by an integer, or a set of integers, possibly but not necessarily limited
by a maximal value N . An evolution law prescribes the values of the cells at time t + 1
if the values at time t (or t and t −1 ) are given. Typically, the evolution law for the
data in a cell at the space-time position
(⃗x, t) ,
⃗x = (x1, x2, · · · , xd) ,
xi, t ∈Z ,
(5.1)
will only depend on the data in neighbouring cells at (⃗x ′, t −1) and possibly those at
(⃗x, t −2) . If, in this evolution law, ∥⃗x ′ −⃗x∥is limited by some bound, then the cellular
automaton is said to obey locality.
Furthermore, the cellular automaton is said to be time-reversible if the data in the
past cells can be recovered from the data at later times, and if the rule for this is also
a cellular automaton. Time reversibility can easily be guaranteed if the evolution law is
assumed to be of the form
Q(⃗x, t + 1) = Q(⃗x, t −1) + F(⃗x, {Q(t)}) ,
(5.2)
52

where Q(⃗x, t) represent the data at a given point (⃗x, t) of the space-time lattice, and
F(⃗x, {Q(t)}) is some given function of the data of all cells neighbouring the point ⃗x at
time t . The + here stands for addition, addition modulo some integer N , or some other
simple, invertible operation in the space of variables Q . Of course, we then have time
reversibility:
Q(⃗x, t −1) = Q(⃗x, t + 1) −F(⃗x, {Q(t)}) ,
(5.3)
where −is the inverse of the operation + .
The simple cogwheel model allows for both a classical and a quantum mechanical
description, without any modiﬁcation of the physics. We can now do exactly the same
thing for the cellular automaton.
The classical states the automaton can be in, are
regarded as an orthonormal set of basis elements of an ontological basis. The evolution
operator Uop(δt) for one single time step whose duration is δt , is a unitary operator, so
that all its eigen states |Ei⟩are unimodular:
Uop(δt)|Ei⟩= e−iωi|Ei⟩,
0 ≤ω < 2π ,
(5.4)
and one can ﬁnd an operator Hop such that
Uop(δt) = e−iHopδt ,
0 ≤Hop < 2π/δt .
(5.5)
However, one is free to add integer multiples of 2π/δt to any of the eigen values of
this Hamiltonian without changing the expression for Uop , so that there is a lot of free-
dom in the deﬁnition of Hop . One may add arbitrary phase angles to the eigenstates,
|Ei⟩→eiϕi|Ei⟩, and these modiﬁcations may also depend on possible conserved quan-
tities. Clearly, one can modify the Hamiltonian quite a bit without damaging its use-
fulness to generate the evolution operator Uop . In subsection 2.2.2 of section 2.2, it is
demonstrated how quite complex energy spectra can emerge this way in relatively simple
generalisations of the cogwheel model.
Modiﬁcations of this sort in the Hamiltonian may well be needed if we wish to reﬂect
the locality property of the cellular automaton in the Hamiltonian:
Hop ?=
X
⃗x
Hop (⃗x) ,
[ Hop (⃗x ′) , Hop (⃗x) ] →0
if
∥⃗x ′ −⃗x∥≫1 ,
(5.6)
but it is an important mathematical question whether a Hamiltonian obeying Eq. (5.6)
can be constructed even if the classical cellular automaton is local in the sense described
above. This problem is discussed further in subsection 5.6.1, in section 9.1, and in part
II, chapters 14 and 22. There, we shall see that the situation can become quite complex.
Very good approximations may exist for certain cellular automaton systems with possibly
some modiﬁed locality properties and a Hamiltonian that approximately obeys a locality
principle as in Eq. (5.6).
Note, that a Hamiltonian that obeys (5.6) in combination with Poincar´e invariance
will correspond to a fully renormalized quantum ﬁeld theory, with all complexities of that,
and this assures that ﬁnding a complete mathematical solution to the problems sketched
will not be easy.

5.2.
The CAT and the CAI
The Cellular Automaton Theory (CAT) assumes that, once a universal Schr¨odinger equa-
tion has been identiﬁed that encapsulates all conceivable phenomena in the universe (a
Grand Uniﬁed Theory, or a Theory for Everything), it will feature an ontological basis
that maps the system into a classical automaton. It is possible, indeed quite likely, that
the true automaton of the universe will be more complex than an ‘ordinary’ cellular au-
tomaton as sketched here, but it may well share some of its main characteristics. The
extent to which this is so, will have to be sorted out by further research.
How the symmetries of nature will be reﬂected in these classical rules is also diﬃcult
to foresee; it is diﬃcult to imagine how Lorentz invariance and diﬀeomorphism invariance
can be realised in these classical rules. Probably, they will refer to more general quantum
basis choices. This we will assume, for the time being, see in Part II, chapter 18 on
symmetries.
This theory then does seem to be what is usually called a ‘hidden variable theory’.
Indeed, in a sense, our variables are hidden; if symmetry transformations exist that trans-
form our basis into another one, which diagonalises diﬀerent operators, then it will be
almost impossible for us to tell which of these is the ‘true’ ontological basis, and so we
will have diﬀerent candidates for the ‘hidden variables’, which will be impossible to dis-
tinguish in practice.
The Cellular Automaton Interpretation (CAI) [72] takes it for granted that this theory
is correct, even if we will never be able to explicitly identify any ontological basis. We
assume that the templates presently in use in quantum mechanics are to be regarded as
superpositions of ontological states, and that the classical states that describe outcomes
of observations and measurements are probabilistic distributions of ontological states. If
two classical states are distinguishable, their probabilistic distributions have no ontological
state in common (see Fig. 6 b ). The universe is in a single ontological state, never in a
superposition of such states, but, whenever we use our templates (that is, when we perform
a conventional quantum mechanical calculation), we use superpositions just because they
are mathematically convenient.
Note that, because the superpositions are linear, our
templates obey the same Schr¨odinger equation as the ontological states do.
In principle, the transformation from a conventional quantum basis to an ontological
basis may be quite complex. Only the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian will be unaﬀected,
and also in deterministic models, these can form quite general spectra, see Figure 3 c .
In group theory language, the Hamiltonians we obtain by transforming to diﬀerent basis
choices, will form one single conjugacy class, characterised by the set of eigenvalues.
Eventually, our quantum system should be directly related to some quantum ﬁeld
theory in the continuum limit. We describe quantum ﬁeld theories in part II, chapter 20.
At ﬁrst sight, it may seem to be obvious that the Hamiltonian should take the form
of Eq. (5.6), but we have to remember that the Hamiltonian deﬁnitions (2.8), (2.18),
(2.26) and the expressions illustrated in Fig. 3, are only well-deﬁned modulo 2π/δt , so
that, when diﬀerent, non interacting systems are combined, their Hamiltonians do not
necessarily have to add up.
54

These expressions do show that the Hamiltonian Hop can be chosen in many ways,
since one can add any operator that commutes with Hop . Therefore it is reasonable to
expect that a Hamiltonian obeying Eq. (5.6) can be deﬁned. An approach is explained in
much more detail in Part II, chapter 21, but some ambiguity remains, and convergence
of the procedure, even if we limit ourselves to low energy states, is far from obvious.
What we do see is this: a Hamiltonian obeying Eq. (5.6) is the sum of terms that each
are ﬁnite and bounded below as well as above. Such a Hamiltonian must have a ground
state, that is, an eigenstate |∅⟩with lowest eigenvalue, which could be normalised to zero.
This eigenstate should be identiﬁed with the ‘vacuum’. This vacuum is stationary, even if
the automaton itself may have no stationary solution. The next-to-lowest eigenstate may
be a one-particle state. In a Heisenberg picture, the ﬁelds Q(⃗x, t) will behave as operators
Qop(⃗x, t) when we pass on to a basis of template states, and as such they may create one-
particle states out of the vacuum. Thus, we arrive at something that resembles a genuine
quantum ﬁeld theory.
The states are quantum states in complete accordance with a
Copenhagen interpretation.
The ﬁelds Qop (⃗x, t) should obey the Wightman axioms.
Quantum ﬁeld theories will further be discussed in chapter 20.
However, if we start from just any cellular automaton, there are three ways in which
the resulting theory will diﬀer from conventional quantum ﬁeld theories. One is, of course,
that space and time are discrete. Well, maybe there is an interesting ‘continuum limit’,
in which the particle mass(es) is(are) considerably smaller than the inverse of the time
quantum, but, unless our models are chosen very carefully, this will not be the case.
Secondly, the generic cellular automaton will not even remotely be Lorentz invariant.
Not only will the one-particle states fail to exhibit Lorentz invariance, or even Galilei
invariance; the states where particles may be moving with respect to the vacuum state
will be completely diﬀerent from the static one-particle states. Also, rotation symmetry
will be reduced to some discrete lattice rotation group if anything at all. So, the familiar
symmetries of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories will be totally absent.
Thirdly, it is not clear that the cellular automaton can be associated to a single
quantum model or perhaps many inequivalent ones. The addition or removal of other
conserved operators to Hop is akin to the addition of chemical potential terms. In the
absence of Lorentz invariance, it will be diﬃcult to distinguish the diﬀerent types of
‘vacuum’ states one thus obtains.
For all these reasons, most cellular automaton models will be very diﬀerent from the
quantised ﬁeld theories for elementary particles. The main issue discussed in this book,
however, is not whether it is easy to mimic the Standard Model in a cellular automaton,
but whether one can obtain quantum mechanics, and something resembling quantum
ﬁeld theory at least in principle. The origin of the continuous symmetries of the Standard
Model will stay beyond what we can handle in this book, but we can discuss the question
to what extent cellular automata can be used to approximate and understand the quantum
nature of this world. See our discussion of symmetry features in part II, section 18.
As will be explained later, it may well be that invariance under general coordinate
transformations will be a crucial ingredient in the explanation of continuous symmetries,
55

so it may well be that the ultimate explanation of quantum mechanics will also require
the complete solution of the quantum gravity problem. We cannot pretend to have solved
that.
Many of the other models in this book will be explicitly integrable. The cellular au-
tomata that we started oﬀwith in the ﬁrst section of this chapter illustrate that our
general philosophy also applies to non-integrable systems. It is generally believed, how-
ever, that time reversible cellular automata can be computationally universal [35]. This
means that any such automaton can be arranged in special subsets of states that obey the
rule of any other computationally universal cellular automaton. One would be tempted to
argue then, that any computationally universal cellular automaton can be used to mimic
systems as complicated as the Standard Model of the subatomic particles. However, in
that case, being physicists, we would ask for one single special model that is more eﬃcient
than any other, so that any choice of initial state in this automaton describes a physically
realisable conﬁguration.
5.3.
Motivation
It is not too far-fetched to expect that, one day, quantum gravity will be completely
solved, that is, a concise theory will be phrased that shows an air-tight description of the
relevant physical degrees of freedom, and a simple model will be proposed that shows how
these physical variables evolve. We might not even need a conventional time variable for
that, but what we do need is an unambiguous prescription telling us how the physical
degrees of freedom will look in a region of space-time that lies in the future of a region
described earlier.
A complete theory explaining quantum mechanics can probably not be formulated
without also addressing quantum gravity, but what we can do is to formulate our proposal,
and to establish the language that will have to be employed. Today, our description of
molecules, atoms, ﬁelds and relativistic subatomic particles is interspersed with wave
functions and operators. Our operators do not commute with operators describing other
aspects of the same world, and we have learned not to be surprised by this, but just
to choose a set of basis elements as we please, guess a reasonable looking Schr¨odinger
equation, and calculate what we should ﬁnd when we measure things. We were told not
to ask what reality is, and this turned out to be a useful advice: we calculate, and we
observe that the calculations make sense. It is unlikely that any other observable aspects
of ﬁelds and particles can ever be calculated, it will never be more than what we can
derive from quantum mechanics. For example, given a radio-active particle, we cannot
calculate exactly at what moment it will decay. The decay is controlled by a form of
randomness that we cannot control, and this randomness seems to be far more perfect
than what can be produced using programmed pseudo-random sequences. We are told to
give up any hope to outsmart Nature in this respect.
The Cellular Automaton Interpretation (CAI) suggests to us what it is that we actually
do when we solve a Schr¨odinger equation. We thought that we are following an inﬁnite set
of diﬀerent worlds, each with some given amplitude, and the ﬁnal events that we deduce
56

from our calculations depend on what happens in all these worlds. This, according to
the CAI, is an illusion. There is no inﬁnity of diﬀerent worlds, there is just one, but
we are using the “wrong” basis to describe it. The word “wrong” is here used not to
criticise the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, who made marvellous discoveries,
but to repeat what they of course also found out, which is that the basis they are using
is not an ontological one. The terminology used to describe that basis does not disclose
to us exactly how our world, our single world, ‘actually’ evolves in time.
Many other proposed interpretations of quantum mechanics exist. These may either
regard the endless numbers of diﬀerent worlds all to be real, or they require some sort of
modiﬁcation, mutilation rather, to understand how a wave function can collapse to pro-
duce measured values of some observable without allowing for mysterious superpositions
at the classical scale.
The CAI proposes to use the complete mathematical machinery that has been de-
veloped over the years to address quantum mechanical phenomena. It includes exactly
the Copenhagen prescriptions to translate the calculations into precise predictions when
experiments are done, so, at this point, deﬁnitely no modiﬁcations are required.
There is one important way in which we deviate from Copenhagen however. According
to Copenhagen, certain questions are not to be asked:
Can it be that our world is just a single world where things happen, according
to evolution equations that might be fundamentally simpler than Schr¨odinger’s
equation, and are there ways to ﬁnd out about this?
Can one remove the
element of statistical probability distributions from the basic laws of quantum
mechanics?
According to Copenhagen, there exist no experiments that can answer such questions,
and therefore it is silly even to ask them. But what I have attempted to show in this
work is that not experimentally, but theoretically, we may ﬁnd answers.
We may be
able to identify models that describe a single classical world, even if forbiddingly complex
compared to what we are used to, and we may be able to identify its physical degrees of
freedom with certain quantum variables that we already know about.
The cellular automaton described in the preceding sections, would be the prototype
example; it is complicated yet quite possibly not complicated enough. It has symmetries,
but in the real world there are much larger symmetry groups, such as the Lorentz or
Poincar´e group, showing relations between diﬀerent kinds of events, and these are ad-
mittedly diﬃcult to implement. The symmetry groups, think of space-time translation
symmetry, may actually be at the roots of the mysterious features that were found in our
quantum world, so that these may have natural explanations.
Why should we want just a single world with classical equations describing its evo-
lution? What’s wrong with obeying Copenhagen’s dictum about not asking questions, if
they will not be experimentally accessible anyway?
According to the author, there will be overwhelming motivations: If a classical model
does exist, it will tremendously simplify our view of the world, it will help us once and
57

forever to understand what really happens when a measurement is made and a wave
function ‘collapses’. It will explain the Schr¨odinger cat paradox once and for good.
Even more importantly, the quantum systems that allow for a classical interpretation
form an extremely tiny subset of all quantum models. If it is indeed true that our world
falls in that class, which one may consider to be likely after having read all this, then this
restricts our set of allowable models so much that it may enable us to guess the right one,
a guess that otherwise could never have been made. So indeed, what we are really after is
a new approach towards guessing what the ‘Theory of the World’ is. We strongly suspect
that, without this superb guide, we will never even come close. Thus, our real motivation
is not to be able to better predict the outcomes of experiments, which may not happen
soon, but rather to predict which class of models we should scrutinise to ﬁnd out about
the truth.
Let us emphasise once more, that this means that the CAI / CAT will primarily be
of importance if we wish to decipher nature’s laws at the most fundamental time- and
distance scales, that is, the Planck scale. Thus, an important new frontier where the
empire of the quantum meets the classical world, is proclaimed to be near the Planckian
dimensions. As we also brought forward repeatedly, the CAI requires a reformulation of
our standard quantum language also when describing the other important border: that
between the quantum empire and the ‘ordinary’ classical world at distance scales larger
than the sizes of atoms and molecules.
The CAI actually has more in common with the original Copenhagen doctrine than
many other approaches, as will be explained. It will do away with the ‘many worlds’, more
radically than the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation. The CAI assumes the existence of one
or more models of Nature that have not yet been discovered. We do discuss many toy
models. These toy models are not good enough to come anywhere close to the Standard
Model, but there is reason to hope that one day such a model will be found. In any case,
the CAI will apply only to a tiny sub class of all quantum mechanical models usually
considered to explain the observed world, and for this reason we hope it might be helpful
to pin down the right procedure to arrive at the correct theory.
Other models were exposed in this work, just to display the set of tools that one might
choose to use.
5.3.1.
The wave function of the universe
Standard quantum mechanics can confront us with a question that appears to be diﬃcult
to answer: Does the universe as a whole have a wave function? Can we describe that wave
function? Several responses to this question can be envisaged:
(1) I do not know, and I do not care. Quantum mechanics is a theory about observations
and measurements. You can’t measure the entire universe.
(2) I do care, but I do not know. Such a wave function might be so much entangled
that it will be impossible to describe. Maybe the universe has a density matrix, not
a wave function.
58

(3) The universe has no ﬁxed wave function. Every time an observation or measurement
is made, the wave function collapses, and this collapse phenomenon does not follow
any Schr¨odinger equation.
(4) Yes, the universe has a wave function. It obeys the Schr¨odinger equation, and at
all times the probability that some state |ψ⟩is realised is given by the norm of the
inner product squared. Whenever any ‘collapse’ takes place, it always obeys the
Schr¨odinger equation.
The agnostic answers (1) and (2) are scientiﬁcally of course defensible. We should limit
ourselves to observations, so don’t ask silly questions. However, they do seem to admit
that quantum mechanics may not have universal validity. It does not apply to the universe
as a whole. Why not? Where exactly is the limit of the validity of quantum mechanics?
The ideas expressed in this work were attacked because they allegedly do not agree with
observations, but all observations ever made in atomic and subatomic science appear to
conﬁrm the validity of quantum mechanics, while the answers (1) and (2) suggest that
quantum mechanics should break down at some point. In the CAI, we assume that the
mathematical rules for the application of quantum mechanics have absolute validity. This,
we believe, is not a crazy assumption.
In the same vein, we also exclude answer (3). The collapse should not be regarded as a
separate axiom of quantum mechanics, one that would invalidate the Schr¨odinger equation
whenever an observation, a measurement, and hence a collapse takes place. Therefore,
according to our theory, the only correct answer is answer (4). An apparent problem
with this would be that the collapse would require ‘conspiracy’, a very special choice of
the initial state because otherwise we might accidentally arrive at wave functions that
are quantum superpositions of diﬀerent collapsed states. This is where the ontological
basis comes to the rescue. If the universe is in an ontological state, its wave function will
collapse automatically, whenever needed. As a result, classical conﬁgurations, such as the
positions and velocities of the planets are always described by wave functions that are
delta-peaked at these values of the data, whereas wave functions that are superpositions
of planets in diﬀerent locations, will never be ontological.
The conclusion of this subsection is that, as long as we work with templates, our
amplitudes are psi-epistemic, as they were in the Copenhagen view, but a psi-ontic wave
function does exist: the wave function of the universe itself. It is epistemic and ontological
at the same time.
Now, let us go back to Copenhagen, and formulate the rules.
As the reader can
see, in some respects we are even more conservative than the most obnoxious quantum
dogmatics.
5.4.
The rules
As for the Copenhagen rules that we keep, we emphasise the ones most important to us:
(i) To describe a physical phenomenon, the use of any basis is as legitimate as any other.
59

We are free to perform any transformation we like, and rephrase the Schr¨odinger
equation, or rather, the Hamiltonian employed in it, accordingly. In each basis we
may ﬁnd a useful description of variables, such as positions of particles, or the
values of their momenta, or the energy states they are in, or the ﬁelds of which
these particles are the energy quanta. All these descriptions are equally ‘real’ .
But none of the usually employed descriptions are completely real. We often see that
superpositions occur, and the phase angles of these superpositions can be measured, oc-
casionally. In such cases, the basis used is not an ontological one. In practice, we have
learned that this is just ﬁne; we use all of these diﬀerent basis choices in order to have
templates. We shall impose no restrictions on which template is ‘allowed’, or which of
them may represent the truth ‘better’ than others. Since these are mere templates, reality
may well emerge to be a superposition of diﬀerent templates.
Curiously, even among the diehards of quantum mechanics, this was often thought
not to be self-evident. “Photons are not particles, protons and electrons are”, was what
some investigators claimed. Photons must be regarded as energy quanta. They certainly
thought it was silly to regard the phonon as a particle; it is merely the quantum of sound.
Sometimes it is claimed that electric and magnetic ﬁelds are the ”true” variables, while
photons are merely abstract concepts. There were disputes on whether a particle is a true
particle in the position representation or in the momentum representation, and so on.
We do away with all this. All basis choices are equivalent. They are nothing more than
a coordinate frame in Hilbert space. As long as the Hamiltonian employed appears to
be such that ﬁnite-time evolution operators turn diagonal operators (beables) into non-
diagonal ones (superimposables), these basis choices are clearly non-ontological; none of
them describes what is really happening. As for the energy basis, see subsection 5.6.3.
Note, that this means that it is not really the Hamiltonian that we will be interested in,
but rather its conjugacy class. If a Hamiltonian H is transformed into a new Hamiltonian
by the transformation
˜H = G H G−1 ,
(5.7)
where G is a unitary operator, then the new Hamiltonian ˜H , in the new basis, is just
as valid as the previous one. In practice, we shall seek the basis, or its operator G , that
gives the most concise possible expression for ˜H .
(ii) Given a ket state |ψ⟩, the probability for the outcome of a measurement to be de-
scribed by a given state |a⟩in Hilbert space, is exactly given by the absolute square
of the inner product ⟨a|ψ⟩.
This is the well-known Born rule. We shall never modify its mathematical form; only
the absolute squares of the inner products can be used. However, there is a limitation in
principle: the bra state ⟨a| must be an ontological state. In practice, this is always the
case: the bras ⟨a| usually are represented by the classical observations. The Born rule is
often portrayed as a separate axiom of the Copenhagen Interpretation. In our view it is
60

an inevitable consequence of the mathematical nature of quantum mechanics as a tool to
perform calculations, see section 4.3.
The most important point where we depart from Copenhagen is that we make some
fundamental assumptions:
(a) We postulate the existence of an ontological basis. It is an orthonormal basis of
Hilbert space that is truly superior to the basis choices that we are familiar with. In
terms of an ontological basis, the evolution operator for a suﬃciently ﬁne mesh of
time variables, does nothing more than permute the states.
How exactly to deﬁne the mesh of time variables we do not know at present, and may
well become a subject of debate, particularly in view of the known fact that space-time
has a general coordinate invariance built in. We do not claim to know how to arrive
at this construction – it is too diﬃcult. In any case, the system is expected to behave
entirely as a classical construction. Our basic assumption is that a classical evolution
law exists, dictating exactly how space-time and all its contents evolve. The evolution is
deterministic in the sense that nothing is left to chance. Probabilities enter only if, due
to our ignorance, we seek our refuge in some non-ontological basis.
(b) When we perform a conventional quantum mechanical calculation, we employ a set
of templates for what we thought the wave function is like. These templates, such as
the orthonormal set of solutions of the hydrogen atom, just happen to be the states
for which we know how they evolve. However, they are in a basis that is a rather
complicated unitary transformation of the ontological basis.
Humanity discovered that these templates obey Schr¨odinger equations, and we employ
these to compute probabilities for the outcomes of experiments.
These equations are
correct to very high accuracies, but they falsely suggest that there is a ‘multiverse’ of
many diﬀerent worlds that interfere with one another. Today, these templates are the
best we have.
(c) Very probably, there are more than one diﬀerent choices for the ontological basis,
linked to one another by Nature’s continuous symmetry transformations such as
the elements of the Poincar´e group, but possibly also by the local diﬀeomorphism
group used in General Relativity. Only one of these ontological bases will be ‘truly’
ontological.
Which of them will be truly ontological will be diﬃcult or impossible to determine. The
fact that we shall not be able to distinguish the diﬀerent possible ontological bases, will
preclude the possibility of using this knowledge to perform predictions beyond the usual
quantum mechanical ones. This was not our intention anyway. The motivation for this
investigation has alway been that we are searching for new clues for constructing models
more reﬁned than the Standard Model.
61

The symmetry transformations that link diﬀerent (but often equivalent) ontological
basis choices are likely to be truly quantum mechanical: operators that are diagonal in
one of these ontological bases may be non diagonal in an other. However, in the very end
we shall only use the ‘real’ ontological basis. This will be evident in axiom (e).
(d) Classical states are ontological, which means that classical observables are always
diagonal in the ‘truly’ ontological basis.
This would be more diﬃcult to ‘prove’ from ﬁrst principles, so we introduce it indeed as
an axiom. However, it seems to be very diﬃcult to avoid: it is hard to imagine that two
diﬀerent classical states, whose future evolution will be entirely diﬀerent in the end, could
have non-vanishing inner products with the same ontological state.
(e) From the very beginning onwards, the Universe was, and it always will be, in a single,
evolving ontological state. This means that not only the observables are diagonal in
the ontological basis, but the wave function always takes the simplest possible form:
it is one of the elements of the basis itself, so this wave function only contains a
single 1 and for the rest zeros.
Note that this singles out the ‘true’ ontological basis from other choices, where the physical
degrees of freedom can also be represented by ‘beables’, that is, operators that at all
times commute. So, henceforth, we only refer to this one ‘true’ ontological basis as ‘the’
ontological basis.
Most importantly, the last two axioms completely solve the measurement problem
[25], the collapse question and Schr¨odinger’s cat paradox. The argument is now simply
that Nature is always in a single ontological state, and therefore it has to evolve into a
single classical state.
5.5.
Features of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation (CAI)
A very special feature of the CAI is that ontological states do never form superpositions.
From day and time zero onwards, the universe must have been in a single ontological state
that evolves. This is also the reason why it never evolves into a superposition of classical
states. Now remember that the Schr¨odinger equation is obeyed by the ontological states
the universe may be in. This then is the reason why this theory automatically generates
‘collapsed wave functions’ that describe the results of a measurement, without ever parting
from the Schr¨odinger equation. For the same reason, ontological states can never evolve
into a superposition of a dead cat and a live cat. Regarded from this angle, it actually
seems hard to see how any other interpretation of quantum mechanics could have survived
in the literature: quantum mechanics by itself would have predicted that if states | ψ ⟩and
| χ ⟩can be used as initial states, so can the state α| ψ ⟩+ β| χ ⟩. Yet the superposition
of a dead cat and a live cat cannot serve to describe the ﬁnal state. If | ψ ⟩evolves into

The Cellular Automaton Interpretation adds some notions to quantum mechanics that
do not have any distinguished meaning in the usual Copenhagen view. We introduced
the ontological basis as being, in some sense, superior to any other choice of basis. One
might naturally argue that this would be a step backwards in physics. Did Copenhagen,
in section 5.4, not emphasise that all choices of basis are equivalent? Why would one
choice stand out?
Indeed, what was stated in rule #i in section 5.4 was that all basis choices are equiv-
alent, but what we really meant was that all basis choices normally employed are equiv-
alent. Once we adopt the Copenhagen doctrine, it does not matter anymore which basis
we choose. Yet there is one issue in the Copenhagen formalism that has been heavily dis-
puted in the literature and now is truly recognised as a weakness: the collapse of the wave
function and the treatment of measurements. At these points the superposition axiom
fails. As soon as we admit that one superior basis exists, this weakness disappears. All
wave functions may be used to describe a physical process, but then we have to tolerate
the collapse axiom if we do not work in the ontological basis.
The CAI allows us to use a basis that stands out.
It stands out because, in this
basis, we recognise wave functions that are special: the ontological wave functions. In the
ontological basis, the ontological wave functions are the wave functions that correspond
to the basis elements; each of these wave functions contains a one and for the rest zeros.
The ontological wave functions exclusively evolve into ontological wave functions again.
In this basis, there is no room for chance anymore, and superpositions can be completely
avoided.
The fact that, also in the usual formalism of quantum mechanics, states that start out
with a classical description, such as beams of particles aimed at each other, end up as
classical probability distributions of particles coming out of the interaction region, in our
view can be seen as evidence for an ‘ontology conservation law’, a law that says that an
ontological basis exists, such that true ontological states at one moment of time, always
evolve into true ontological states at later times. This is a new conservation law. It is
tempting to conclude that the CAI is inevitable.
In the ontological basis, the evolution is deterministic. However, this term must be
used with caution. “Deterministic” cannot imply that the outcome of the evolution pro-
cess can be foreseen. No human, nor even any other imaginable intelligent being, will be
able to compute faster than Nature itself. The reason for this is obvious: our intelligent
being would also have to employ Nature’s laws, and we have no reason to expect that
Nature can duplicate its own actions more eﬃciently than having them happen in the
ﬁrst place. This is how one may restore the concept of “free will”: whatever happens in
our brains is unique and unforeseeable by anyone or anything.
5.5.1.
Beables, changeables and superimposables
Having a special basis and special wave functions, also allows us to distinguish special
observables or operators. In standard quantum mechanics, we learned that operators and
observables are indistinguishable, so we use these concepts interchangeably. Now, we will
63

have to learn to restore the distinctions. We repeat what was stated in subsection 2.1.1,
operators can be of three diﬀerent forms:
(I) beables Bop : these denote a property of the ontological states, so that beables are
diagonal in the ontological basis {|A⟩, |B⟩, · · ·} of Hilbert space:
B a
op|A⟩= B a(A)|A⟩,
(beable) .
(5.8)
Beables will always commute with one another, at all times:
[B a
op(⃗x1, t1), B b
op(⃗x2, t2)] = 0
∀
⃗x1, ⃗x2, t1, t2.
(5.9)
Quantised ﬁelds, copiously present in all elementary particle theories, do obey Eq. (5.9),
but only outside the light cone (where |t1 −t2| < |⃗x1 −⃗x2| ), not inside that cone, where
Eqs. (20.29), see Part II, do not hold, as can easily be derived from explicit calculations.
Therefore, quantised ﬁelds are altogether diﬀerent from beables.
(II) changeables Cop : operators that replace an ontological state |A⟩by another onto-
logical state |B⟩, such as a permutation operator:
Cop|A⟩= |B⟩,
(changeable) .
(5.10)
Changeables do not commute, but they do have a special relationship with beables; they
interchange them:
B(1)
op Cop = CopB(2)
op .
(5.11)
We may want to make an exception for inﬁnitesimal changeables, such as the Hamiltonian
Hop :
[Bop, Hop] = −i ∂
∂tBop .
(5.12)
(III) superimposables Sop : these map an ontological state onto any other, more general
superposition of ontological states:
Sop|A⟩= λ1|A⟩+ λ2|B⟩+ · · · ,
(superimposable) .
(5.13)
All operators normally used are superimposables, even the simplest position or momentum
operators of classroom quantum mechanics. This is easily veriﬁed by checking the time-
dependent commutation rules (in the Heisenberg representation). In general20:
[⃗x(t1), ⃗x(t2)] ̸= 0 ,
if t1 ̸= t2 .
(5.14)
20A rare exception, for example, is the harmonic oscillator when the time span is an integer multiple
of the period T .

5.5.2.
Observers and the observed
Standard quantum mechanics taught us a number of important lessons. One was that
we should not imagine that an observation can be made without disturbing the observed
object. This warning is still valid in the CAI. If measuring the position of a particle means
checking the wave function whether perhaps ⃗x ?= ⃗x(1) , this may be interpreted as having
the operator Pop(⃗x(1)) act on the state:
|ψ⟩→Pop(⃗x(1))|ψ⟩,
Pop(⃗x(1)) = δ(⃗xop −⃗x(1)) .
(5.15)
This modiﬁes the state, and consequently all operators acting on it after that may yield
results diﬀerent from what they did before the “measurement”.
However, when a genuine beable acts on an ontological state, the state is simply
multiplied with the value found, but will evolve in the same way as before (assuming we
chose the ‘true’ ontological basis, see axiom # c in section 5.4). Thus, measurements of
beables are, in a sense, classical measurements.
Other measurements, which seem to be completely legal according to conventional
quantum mechanics, will not be possible in the CAI. In the CAI, as in ordinary quantum
mechanics, we can consider any operator and study its expectation value.
But since
the class of physically realisable wave functions is now smaller than in standard QM,
certain states can no longer be realised, and we cannot tell what the outcome of such a
measurement could possibly be. Think of any (non inﬁnitesimal) changeable Cop . All
ontological states will give the ‘expectation value’ zero to such a changeable, but we can
consider its eigenvalues, which in general will not yield the value zero. The corresponding
eigenstates are deﬁnitely not ontological (see subsection 5.7.1).
Does this mean that standard quantum mechanics is in conﬂict with the CAI? We
emphasise that this is not the case. It must be realised that, also in conventional quantum
mechanics, it may be considered acceptable to say that the Universe has been, and will
always be, in one and the same quantum state, evolving in time in accordance with the
Schr¨odinger equation (in the Schr¨odinger picture), or staying the same (in the Heisenberg
picture). If this state happens to be one of our ontological states then it behaves exactly
as it should. Ordinary quantum mechanics makes use of template states, most of which
are not ontological, but then the real world in the end must be assumed to be in a
superposition of these template states so that the ontological state resurfaces anyway,
and our apparent disagreements disappear.
5.5.3.
Inner products of template states
In doing technical calculations, we perform transformations and superpositions that lead
to large sets of quantum states which we now regard as templates, or candidate models
for (sub) atomic processes that can always be superimposed at a later stage to describe
the phenomena we observe. Inner products of templates can be studied the usual way.
A template state |ψ⟩can be used to serve as a model of some actually observed
phenomenon. It can be any quantum superposition of ontological states |A⟩. The inner
65

product expressions |⟨A|ψ⟩|2 then represent the probabilities that ontological state |A⟩
is actually realised.
According to the Copenhagen rule #ii, section 5.4, the probability that the template
state |ψ1⟩is found to be equal to the state |ψ2⟩, is given by | ⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩|2 .
However,
already at the beginning, section 2.1, we stated that the inner product ⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩should
not be interpreted this way. Even if their inner product vanishes, template states |ψ1⟩
and |ψ2⟩may both have a non vanishing coeﬃcient with the same ontological state |A⟩.
This does not mean that we depart from Copenhagen rule #ii, but that the true wave
function cannot be just a generic template state; it is always an ontological state |A⟩.
This means that the inner product rule is only true if either |ψ1⟩or |ψ2⟩is an ontological
state while the other may be a template. We are then considering the probability that
the template state coincides exactly with one of the ontological states |A⟩. We may use
the Born interpretation of the inner product if the template state in question is used to
describe only a small subspace of all physical degrees of freedom. How the unobserved
degrees of freedom are entangled with this state is then immaterial. Thus, the template
state then can be assumed to represent a probability distribution of the ontological states
of the universe.
We see that the inner product rule can be used in two ways; one is to describe the
probability distribution of the initial states of a system under consideration, and one is
to describe the probability that a given classical state is reached at the end of a quantum
process. If the Born rule is used to describe the initial probabilities, the same rule can be
used to calculate the probabilities for the ﬁnal states.
5.5.4.
Density matrices
Density matrices are used when we neither know exactly the ontological states nor the
templates. One takes a set of templates |ψi⟩, and attributes to them probabilities Wi ≥0 ,
such that P
i Wi = 1 . This is called a mixed state. In standard quantum mechanics, one
then ﬁnds for the expectation values of an operator O :
⟨O ⟩=
X
i
Wi ⟨ψi|O|ψi⟩= Tr (ϱ O) ;
ϱ =
X
i
Wi |ψi⟩⟨ψi| .
(5.16)
The operator ϱ is called the density matrix.
Note that, if the ontologic basis is known, and the operator O is a beable, then the
probabilities are indistinguishable from those generated by a template,
|ψ⟩=
X
i
λi|ψont
i
⟩,
|λi|2 = Wi ,
(5.17)
since in both cases the density matrix in that basis is diagonal:
ϱ =
X
i
Wi |ψont
i
⟩⟨Ψont
i
| .
(5.18)
If O is not a beable, the oﬀ-diagonal elements of the density matrix may seem to be
signiﬁcant, but we have to remember that non-beable operators in principle cannot be
66

measured, and this means that the formal distinction between density matrices and tem-
plates disappears.
Does this imply that mixed states from now on must be considered to be indistin-
guishable from pure template states? Not quite. If several ontological basis choices are
possible, and we do not know the ontic states |ψont⟩, the beable operators are not a priori
known, and this lack of knowledge will force us to use density matrices with non-diagonal
elements in the ontological basis.
Indeed, again, we hit the very core of our present understanding of quantum mechanics.
If we do not know what the ontic states are, we have to keep open the option of using
various choices of mutually non-commuting operators as our template states, and then
the density matrix reﬂects our inability to choose the right ones.
We employ non-commuting sets of operators to characterise a state, before choosing
the operator that will actually be used to measure things. According to the CAI, only that
operator will represent the beables, the others won’t. This feature was at the center of
our considerations concerning Bell’s inequalities as well as the question posed here about
the density matrix.
5.6.
The Hamiltonian
As was explained in the Introduction to this chapter, section 5.1, there are many ways
to choose a Hamiltonian operator that correctly produces a Schr¨odinger equation for the
time dependence of a (cellular) automaton. Yet the Hamiltonian for the quantum world
as we know it, and in particular for the Standard Model, is quite unique. How does one
derive the ‘correct’ Hamiltonian?
Of course there are conserved quantities in the Standard Model, such as chemical po-
tentials, global and local charges, and kinematical quantities such as angular momentum.
Those may be added to the Hamiltonian with arbitrary coeﬃcients, but they are usually
quite distinct from what we tend to call ‘energy’, so it should be possible to dispose of
them. Then, there are many non-local conserved quantities, which explains the large
number of possible shifts δEi in Fig. 3, subsection 2.2.2. Most of such ambiguities will
be removed by demanding the Hamiltonian to be local.
5.6.1.
Locality
Our starting expressions for the Hamiltonian of a deterministic system are Eqs. (2.8) and
(2.26). These, however, converge only very slowly for large values of n . If we apply such
expansions to the cellular automaton, Eqs. (5.2) and (5.3), we see that the nth term will
involve interactions over neighbours that are n steps separated. If we write the total
Hamiltonian H as
H =
X
⃗x
H(⃗x) ,
H(⃗x) =
∞
X
n=1
Hn(⃗x) ,
(5.19)
67

we see contributions Hn(⃗x) that involve interactions over n neighbours, with coeﬃcients
dropping typically as 1/n . Typically,
[Hn(⃗x), Hm(⃗x ′)] = 0
only if
|⃗x −⃗x ′| > n + m ,
(5.20)
while in relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories, we have [H(⃗x), H(⃗x ′)] = 0 as soon as ⃗x ̸= ⃗x ′ .
Considering that the number of interacting neighbouring cells that ﬁt in a d -dimensional
sphere with radius n , may grow rapidly with n , while the leading terms start out being of
the order of the Planck energy, we see that this convergence is too slow: large contributions
spread over large distances. This is not the Hamiltonian that has the locality structure
typical for the Standard Model.
Now this should not have been surprising. The eigenvalues of Hamiltonians (2.8) and
(2.26) are both bounded to the region (0, 2π/δt) , while any Hamiltonian described by
equations such as (5.19), should be extensive: their eigenvalues may grow proportionally
to the volume of space.
A better construction for a cellular automaton is worked out further in part II, chapter
21. There, we ﬁrst introduce the Baker Campbell Hausdorﬀexpansion. In that, also, the
lowest terms correspond to a completely local Hamiltonian density, while all terms are
extensive. Unfortunately, this also comes at a price that is too expensive for us: the Baker
Campbell Hausdorﬀseries does not seem to converge at all in this case. One could argue
that, if used only for states where the total energies are much less than the Planck energy,
the series should converge, but we have no proof for that. Our problem is that, in the
expressions used, the intermediate states can easily represent higher energies.
Several attempts were made to arrive at a positive Hamiltonian that is also a space
integral over local Hamiltonian densities. The problem is that the cellular automaton
only deﬁnes a local evolution operator over ﬁnite time steps, not a local Hamiltonian
that speciﬁes inﬁnitesimal time evolution. Generically valid formal procedures seem to
fail, but if we stick closer to procedures that resemble perturbative quantum ﬁeld the-
ories, we seem to approach interesting descriptions that almost solve the problem. In
chapter 22 of part II, we use second quantisation. This procedure can be summarised
as follows: consider ﬁrst a cellular automaton that describes various types of particles,
all non-interacting. This automaton will be integrable, and its Hamiltonian, H0 , will
certainly obey locality properties, and have a lower bound. Next, one must introduce
interactions as tiny perturbations. This should not be diﬃcult in cellular automata; just
introduce small deviations from the free particle evolution law. These small perturba-
tions, even if discrete and deterministic, can be handled perturbatively, assuming that
the perturbation occurs infrequently, at suﬃciently separated spots in space and time.
This should lead to something that can reproduce perturbative quantum ﬁeld theories
such as the Standard Model.
Note, that in most quantum ﬁeld theories, perturbation expansions have been used
with much success (think for instance of the calculation of the anomalous magnetic mo-
ment g −2 of the electron, which could be calculated and compared with experiment in
superb precision), while it is still suspected that the expansions eventually do not con-
verge. The non-convergence, however, sets in at very high orders, way beyond today’s
68

practical limits of accuracy in experiments.
We now believe that this will be the best way to construct a Hamiltonian with prop-
erties that can be compared to experimentally established descriptions of particles. But,
it is only a strategy; it was not possible to work out the details because the deterministic
free particle theories needed are not yet suﬃciently well understood.
Thus, there is still a lot of work to be done in this domain. The questions are technically
rather involved, and therefore we postpone the details to part II of this book.
5.6.2.
The double role of the Hamiltonian
Without a Hamiltonian, theoretical physics would look completely diﬀerent. In classical
mechanics, we have the central issue that a mechanical system obeys an energy conserva-
tion law. The energy is a non negative, additive quantity that is locally well-deﬁned. It is
these properties that guarantee stability of mechanical systems against complete collapse
or completely explosive solutions.
The classical Hamiltonian principle is a superb way to implement this mechanism.
All that is needed is to postulate an expression for the non-negative, conserved quantity
called energy, which turns into a Hamiltonian H(⃗x, ⃗p ) if we carefully deﬁne the dynamical
quantities on which it depends, being canonical pairs of positions xi and momenta pi .
The ingenious idea was to take as equation of motion the Hamilton equations
d
dtxi(t) = ∂
∂pi
H(⃗x, ⃗p ) ,
d
dtpi(t) = −∂
∂xi
H(⃗x, ⃗p ) .
(5.21)
This guarantees that
d
dtH(⃗x, ⃗p ) = 0 . The fact that the equations (5.21) allow for a large
set of mathematical transformations makes the principle even more powerful.
In quantum mechanics, as the reader should know, one can use the same Hamiltonian
function H to deﬁne a Schr¨odinger equation with the same property: the operator H is
conserved in time. If H is bounded from below, this guarantees the existence of a ground
state, usually the vacuum,
Thus, both quantum and classical mechanics are based on this powerful principle,
where a single physical variable, the Hamiltonian, does two things: it generates the equa-
tions of motion, and it gives a locally conserved energy function that stabilises the solu-
tions of the equations of motion. This is how the Hamiltonian principle describes equations
of motion, or evolution equations, whose solutions are guaranteed to be stable.
Now how does this work in discrete, deterministic systems of the kind studied here?
Our problem is that, in a discrete, classical system, the energy must also be discrete,
but the generator of the evolution must be an operator with continuous eigenvalues. The
continuous diﬀerential equations (5.21) must be replaced by something else. In principle,
this can be done, we could attempt to recover a continuous time variable, and derive
how our system evolves in terms of that time variable.
What we really need is and
operator H , that partly represents a positive, conserved energy, and partly a generator
of inﬁnitesimal time changes. We elaborate this issue further in part II, chapter 19, where,
69

among other things, we construct a classical, discretised Hamiltonian in order to apply a
cellular automaton version of the Hamilton principle.
5.6.3.
The energy basis
Beables are operators that commute at all times, and ontological states are eigenstates
of these beables. There is a trivial example of such operators and such states in the real
world: the Hamiltonian and its eigenstates. According to our deﬁnition they form a set
of beables, but unfortunately, they are trivial: there is only one Hamiltonian, and the
energy eigenstates do not change in time at all. This describes a static classical world.
What is wrong with it?
Since we declared that superpositions of ontological states are not ontological, this
solution also tells us that, if the energy eigenstates would be considered as ontological, no
superpositions of these would be admitted, while all conventional physics only re-emerges
when we do consider superpositions of the energy eigenstates. Only superpositions of
diﬀerent energy states can be time-dependent, so yes, this is a solution, but no, it is
not the solution we want. The energy basis solution emerges for instance if we take the
model of section 2.2.2, Figures 2 and 3, where we replace all loops by trivial loops, having
only a single state, while putting all the physics in the arbitrary numbers δEi . It is in
accordance with the rules, but not useful.
Thus, the choice of the energy basis represents an extreme limit that is often not useful
in practice. We see this also happen when a very important procedure is considered: it
seems that we will have to split energy into two parts: on the one hand, there is a large,
classical component, where energy, equivalent to mass, acts as the source of a gravitational
ﬁeld and as such must be ontological, that is, classical.
This part must probably be
discretized. On the other hand, we have the smaller components of the energy that act
as eigen values of the evolution operator, over suﬃciently large time steps (much larger
than the Planck time). These must form a continuous spectrum.
If we would consider the energy basis as our ontological basis, we regard all of the
energy as classical, but then the part describing evolution disappears; that is not good
physics. See Part II, Figure 19, in subsection 19.4.1. The closed contours in that ﬁgure
must be non-trivial.
5.7.
Miscellaneous
5.7.1.
The Earth–Mars interchange operator
The CAI surmises that quantum models exist that can be regarded as classical systems
in disguise. If one looks carefully at these classical systems, it seems as if any classical
system can be rephrased in quantum language: we simply postulate an element of a basis
of Hilbert space to correspond to every classical physical state that is allowed in the
system. The evolution operator is the permutator that replaces a state by its successor
in time, and we may or may not decide later to consider the continuous time limit.
70

Naturally, therefore, we ask the question whether one can reverse the CAI, and con-
struct quantum theories for systems that are normally considered classical. The answer is
yes. To illustrate this, let us consider the planetary system. It is the prototype of a classi-
cal theory. We consider large planets orbiting around a sun, and we ignore non-Newtonian
corrections such as special and general relativity, or indeed the actual quantum eﬀects,
all of which being negligible corrections. We regard the planets as point particles, even
if they may feature complicated weather patterns, or life; we just look at their classical,
Newtonian equations of motion.
The ontological states are deﬁned by listing the positions ⃗xi and velocities ⃗vi of the
planets (which commute), and the observables describing them are the beables. Yet also
this system allows for the introduction of changeables and superimposables. The quantum
Hamiltonian here is not the classical thing, but
Hquant =
X
i

⃗p op
x, i · ⃗vi + ⃗p op
v, i · ⃗Fi(x)/mi

,
(5.22)
where
⃗p op
x, i = −i ∂
∂⃗xi
,
⃗p op
v, i = −i ∂
∂⃗vi
,
and x = {⃗xi} .
(5.23)
Here, ⃗Fi(x) are the classical forces on the planets, which depend on all positions.
Eq. (5.22) can be written more elegantly as
Hquant =
X
i

⃗p op
x, i · ∂Hclass
∂⃗pi
−⃗p op
p, i · ∂Hclass
∂⃗xi

,
(5.24)
where p op
p, i = m−1
i p op
v, i . Clearly, ⃗p op
x i , ⃗p op
v i
and ⃗p op
p i
are inﬁnitesimal changeables, and so
is, of course, the Hamiltonian Hquant . The planets now span a Hilbert space and behave
as if they were quantum objects. We did not modify the physics of the system.
We can continue to deﬁne more changeables, and ask how they evolve in time. One of
the author’s favourites is the Earth–Mars interchange operator. It puts the Earth where
Mars is now, and puts Mars where planet Earth is. The velocities are also interchanged21.
If Earth and Mars had the same mass then the planets would continue to evolve as if
nothing happened. Since the masses are diﬀerent however, this operator will have rather
complicated properties when time evolves. It is not conserved in time.
The eigenvalues of the Earth–Mars interchange operator XEM are easy to calculate:
XEM = ±1 ,
(5.25)
simply because the square of this operator is one. In standard QM language, XEM is an
observable. It does not commute with the Hamiltonian because of the mass diﬀerences,
but, at a particular moment, t = t1 , we can consider one of its eigenstates and ask how
it evolves.
21We disregarded the moons for a moment; we could drag the moons along as well, or keep them where
they are. They don’t play a role in this argument.
71

Now why does all this sound so strange? How do we observe XEM ? No-one can
physically interchange planet Earth with Mars. But then, no-one can interchange two
electrons either, and yet, in quantum mechanics, this is an important operator.
The
answer to these questions is, that regarding the planetary system, we happen to know
what the beables are: they are the positions and the velocities of the planets, and that
turns them into ontological observables. The basis in which these observables are diagonal
operators is our preferred basis. The elements of this basis are the ontological states of
the planets. If, in a quantum world, investigators one day discover what the ontological
beables are, everything will be expressed in terms of these, and any other operators are
no longer relevant.
It is important to realise that, in spite of the fact that, in Copenhagen language, XEM
is an observable, we cannot measure it, to see whether it is +1 or −1 . This is because
we know the wave function |ont⟩. It is 1 for the actual positions of Earth and Mars, 0
when we interchange the two. This is the superposition
|ont⟩=
1
√
2

| XEM = 1 ⟩+ | XEM = −1 ⟩

;
(5.26)
which is a superposition of two template states. According to Copenhagen, a measurement
would yield ±1 with 50%/50% chances.
5.7.2.
Rejecting local counterfactual deﬁniteness and free will
The arguments usually employed to conclude that local hidden variables cannot exist,
begin with assuming that such hidden variables should imply local counterfactual deﬁ-
niteness. One imagines a set-up such as the EPR-Bell experiment that we exposed in
section 3.6. Alice and Bob are assumed to have the ‘free will’ to choose the orientation of
their polarisation ﬁlters anytime and anyway they wish, and there is no need for them to
consult anyone or anything to reach their (arbitrary) decision. The quantum state of the
photon that they are about to investigate should not depend on these choices, nor should
the state of a photon depend on the choices made at the other side, or on the outcome of
those measurements.
This means that the outcomes of measurements should already be determined by
some algorithm long before the actual measurements are made, and also long before the
choice was made what to measure. It is this algorithm that generates conﬂicts with the
expectations computed in a simple quantum calculation. It is counterfactual, which means
that there may be one ‘factual’ measurement but there would have been many possible
alternative measurements, measurements that are not actually carried out, but whose
results should also have been determined. This is what is usually called counterfactual
deﬁniteness, and it has essentially been disproven by simple logic.
Now, as has been pointed out repeatedly, the violation of counterfactual deﬁniteness
is not at all a feature that is limited to quantum theory. In our example of the planetary
system, subsection 5.7.1, there is no a priori answer to the question which of the two
eigenstates of the Earth-Mars exchange operator, the eigenvalue +1 or −1 , we are in.
This is a forbidden, counterfactual question. But in case of the planetary system, we know
72

what the beables are (the positions and velocities of the planets), whereas in the Standard
Model we do not know this. There, the illegitimacy of counterfactual statements is not
immediately obvious. In essence, we have to posit that Alice and Bob do not have the
free will to change the orientation of their ﬁlters; or if we say that they do, their decisions
must have their roots in the past and, as such, they aﬀect the possible states a photon can
be in. In short, Alice and Bob make decisions that are correlated with the polarisations
of the photons, as explained in section 3.6.
5.7.3.
Entanglement and superdeterminism
An objection often heard against the general philosophy advocated in this work, is that it
would never enable accommodation for entangled particles. The careful reader, however,
must realise by now that, in principle, there should be no problem of this sort. Any
quantum state can be considered as a template, and the evolution of these templates will
be governed by the real Schr¨odinger equation. If the relation between the ontological
basis and the more conventional basis choices is suﬃciently complex, we will encounter
superimposed states of all sorts, so one deﬁnitely also expects states where particles behave
as being ‘quantum-entangled’.
Thus, in principle, it is easy to write down orthonormal transformations that turn
ontic states into entangled template states.
There are some problems and mysteries, however. The EPR paradox and Bell’s the-
orem are examples. As explained in section 3.6, the apparent contradictions can only
be repaired if we assume rather extensive correlations among the ‘hidden variables’ ev-
erywhere in the Universe. The mapping of ontic states into entangled states appears to
depend on the settings chosen by Alice and Bob in the distant future.
It seems as if conspiracy takes place: due to some miraculous correlations in the
events at time t = 0 , a pair of photons ‘knows in advance’ what the polarisation angles
of the ﬁlters will be that they will encounter later, and how they should pass through
them. Where and how did this enter in our formalism, and how does a suﬃciently natural
system, without any conspiracy at the classical level, generate this strange behaviour?
It is not only a feature among entangled particles that may appear to be so problematic.
The conceptual diﬃculty is already manifest at a much more basic level. Consider a single
photon, regardless whether it is entangled with other particles or not. Our description of
this photon in terms of the beables dictates that these beables behave classically. What
happens later, at the polarisation ﬁlter(s), is also dictated by classical laws. These classical
laws in fact dictate how myriads of variables ﬂuctuate at what we call the Planck scale, or
more precisely, the smallest scale where distinguishable physical degrees of freedom can be
recognised, which may or may not be close to what is usually called the Planck scale. Since
entangled particles occur in real experiments, we claim that the basis-transformations
will be suﬃciently complex to transform states that are ontic at the Planck scale, into
entangled states.
But this is not the answer to the question posed. The usual way to phrase the question
is to ask how ‘information’ is passed on. Is this information classical or quantum? If it
73

is true that the templates are fundamentally quantum templates, we are tempted to say,
well, the information passed on is quantum information. Yet it does reduce to classical
information at the Planck scale, and this was generally thought not to be possible.
That must be a mistake. As we saw in section 3.6, the fundamental technical contra-
diction goes away if we assume strong correlations between the quantum ﬂuctuations –
including the vacuum ﬂuctuations – at all distance scales (also including correlations be-
tween the ﬂuctuations generated in quasars that are separated by billions of light years).
We think the point is the following. When we use templates, we do not know in advance
which basis one should pick to make them look like the ontological degrees of freedom as
well as possible. For a photon going through a polarisation ﬁlter, the basis closest to the
ontological one is the basis where coordinates are chosen to be aligned with the ﬁlter. But
this photon may have been emitted by a quasar billions of years ago, how did the quasar
know what the ontological basis is?
The answer is that indeed the quasar knows what the ontological basis is, because our
theory extends to these quasars as well. The information, ‘this is an ontological state,
and any set of superimposed states is not’, is a piece of information that, according to our
theory, is absolutely conserved in time. So, if that turns out to be the basis now, it was
the basis a billion years ago. The quasars seem to conspire in a plot to make fools of our
experimenters, but in reality they just observe a conservation law: the information as to
which quantum states form the ontological basis, is conserved in time. Much like the law
of angular momentum, or any other exactly conserved entity, this conservation law tells
us what this variable is in the future if it is known in the past, and vice-versa.
We must conclude that, if there seems to be conspiracy in our quantum description of
reality, then that is to be considered as a feature of our quantum techniques, not of the
physical system we are looking at. There is no conspiracy in the classical description of
the cellular automaton. Apparent conspiracy is a feature, not a bug.
The answer given here, is often called superdeterminism. It is the idea that indeed Alice
and Bob can only choose ontological states to be measured, never the superimposed states,
which we use as templates. In a sense, their actions were predetermined, but of course
in a totally unobservable way. Superdeterminism only looks weird if one adheres to the
description of entangled particles as being quantum systems, described by their quantum
states. The ontological description does not use quantum states. In that description,
the particles behave in a normal, causal manner. However, we do have to keep in mind
that these particles, and everything else, including Bob and Alice’s minds, are all strongly
correlated. They are correlated now as strongly as when the photons were emitted by the
source, as was laid down22 in the mouse-dropping function, Fig. 5 in subsection 3.6.1.
In subsection 10.3.4, it is explained in explicitly physical terms, what ‘free will’ should
really stand for, and why superdeterminism can clash with it.
22The mouse-dropping function does not show a 100% correlation. This is a feature due to the somewhat
artiﬁcial nature of the model used for the detection. If we use more realistic models for the detection,
the mouse-dropping function might consist of sharper peaks.
74

5.7.4.
The superposition principle in Quantum Mechanics
What exactly happened to the superposition principle in the CA Interpretation of quan-
tum mechanics? Critics of our work brought forward that the CAI disallows superposition,
while obviously the superposition principle is serving quite well as a solid back bone of
quantum mechanics. Numerous experiments conﬁrm that if we have two diﬀerent states,
also any superposition of these states can be realised. Although the reader should have
understood by now how to answer this question, let us attempt to clarify the situation
once again.
At the most basic level of physical law, we assume only ontological states to occur,
and any superposition of these, in principle, does not correspond to an ontological state.
At best, a superposition can be used to describe probabilistic distributions of states (we
call these “template states”, to be used when we do not have the exact information at
hand to determine with absolute certainty which ontological state we are looking at). In
our description of the Standard Model, or any other known physical system such as atoms
and molecules, we do not use ontological states but templates, which can be regarded as
superpositions of ontological states. The hydrogen atom is a template, all elementary
particles we know about are templates, and this means that the wave function of the
universe, which is an ontological state, must be a superposition of our templates. Which
superposition? Well, we will encounter many diﬀerent superpositions when doing repeated
experiments. This explains why we were led to believe that all superpositions are always
allowed.
But not literally all superpositions can occur. Superpositions are man-made. Our
templates are superpositions, but that is because they represent only the very tiny sector
of Hilbert space that we understand today. The entire universe is in only one ontological
state at the time, and it of course cannot go into superpositions of itself.
This fact
now becomes manifestly evident when we consider the “classical limit”. In the classical
limit we again deal with certainties. Classical states are also ontological. When we do a
measurement, by comparing the calculated “template state” with the ontological classical
states that we expect in the end, we recover the probabilities by taking the norm squared
of the amplitudes. Classical states also never go into superpositions of classical states.
Such superpositions never occur.
It appears that for many scientists this is diﬃcult to accept. During a whole century we
have been brainwashed with the notion that superpositions occur everywhere in quantum
mechanics. At the same time we were told that if you try to superimpose classical states,
you will get probabilistic distributions instead. It is here that our present theory is more
accurate: if we knew the wave function of the universe exactly, we would ﬁnd that it always
evolves into one classical state only, without uncertainties and without superpositions.
Of course this does not mean that standard quantum mechanics would be wrong. Our
knowledge of the template states, and how these evolve, is very accurate today. It is only
because it is not yet known how to relate these template states to the ontological states,
that we have to perform superpositions all the time when we do quantum mechanical
calculations. They do lead to statistical distributions in our ﬁnal predictions, rather than
75

certainties. This could only change if we would ﬁnd the ontological states, but since even
the vacuum state is expected to be a template, and as such a complicated superposition
of uncountably many ontic states, we should expect quantum mechanics to stay with us
forever – but as a mathematical tool, not as a mystic departure from classical logic.
5.7.5.
The vacuum state
Is the vacuum state an ontological state? The vacuum state is generally deﬁned to be the
state with lowest energy. This also means that no particles can be found in this state,
simply because particles represent energy, and, in the vacuum state, we have not enough
energy even to allow for the presence of a single particle.
The discretised Hamiltonian is only introduced in section 19 of part II. It is a beable,
but being discrete it can only be a rough approximation of the quantum Hamiltonian at
best, and its lowest energy state is highly degenerate. As such, this is not good enough
to serve as a deﬁnition of a vacuum.
More to the point, the Hamiltonian deﬁned in
section 19.2 is quantised in units that seem to be as large as the Planck mass. It will
be clear that the Hamiltonian to be used in any realistic Schr¨odinger equation has a
much more dense, basically continuous, eigenvalue spectrum. The quantum Hamiltonian
is deﬁnitely not a beable, as we explained earlier above, in section 5.6.3. Therefore, the
vacuum is not an ontological state.
In fact, according to quantum ﬁeld theories, the vacuum contains many virtual par-
ticles or particle-antiparticle pairs that ﬂuctuate in- and out of existence everywhere in
space-time. This is typical for quantum superpositions of ontological states. Furthermore,
the lightest particles in our theories are much lighter than the Planck mass. They are not
ontological, and demanding them to be absent in our vacuum state inevitably turns our
vacuum itself also into a non-ontological state.
This is remarkable, because our vacuum state has one more peculiar property: its
energy density itself is almost perfectly vanishing.
Due to the cosmological constant,
there is energy in our vacuum state, but it is as small as about 6 protons per m3 , an
extremely tiny number indeed, considering the fact that most length scales in particle
physics are indeed much smaller than a metre. This very tiny but non-vanishing number
is one of Nature’s greater mysteries.
And yet, the vacuum appears to be non-ontological, so that it must be a place full
of activity. How to reconcile all these apparently conﬂicting features is not completely
understood.
The vacuum ﬂuctuations may be seen as one of the primary causes of non-vanishing,
non-local correlations, such as the mouse dropping function of section 3.6. Without the
vacuum ﬂuctuations, it would be diﬃcult to understand how these correlations could be
sustained.
76

5.7.6.
Exponential decay
Vacuum ﬂuctuations must be the primary reason why isolated systems such as atoms
and molecules in empty space, show typical quantum features. A very special quantum
mechanical property of many particles is the way they can decay into two or more other
particles. Nearly always, this decay follows a perfect exponential decay law: the probabil-
ity P(t) that the particle of a given type has not yet decayed after elapsed time t obeys
the rule
dP(t)
dt
= −λP(t) ,
→
P(t) = P(0)e−λt ,
(5.27)
where λ is a coeﬃcient that often does not at all depend on external circumstances, or on
time. If we start oﬀwith N0 particles, then the expectation value ⟨N(t)⟩of the particle
number N(t) after time t follows the same law:
⟨N(t)⟩= N0 e−λt .
(5.28)
If there are various modes in which the particle can decay, we have λ = λ1 +λ2 +. . . ,
and the ratios of the λi equals the ratios of the modes of the decays observed.
Now how can this be explained in a deterministic theory such as a cellular automaton?
In general, this would not be possible if the vacuum would be a single ontological state.
Consider particles of a given type. Each individual particle will decay after a diﬀerent
amount of time, precisely in accordance to Eq. (5.27). Also, the directions in which the
decay products will ﬂy will be diﬀerent for every individual particle, while, if there are
three or more decay products involved, also the energy of the various decay products will
follow a probability distribution. For many existing particles, these distributions can be
accurately calculated following the quantum mechanical prescriptions.
In a deterministic theory, all these diﬀerent decay modes would have to correspond
to distinct initial states. This would be hopeless to accommodate for if every individual
particle would have to behave like a ‘glider solution’ of a cellular automaton, since all
these diﬀerent decay features would have to be represented by diﬀerent gliders.
One
would quickly ﬁnd that millions, or billions of diﬀerent glider modes would have to exist.
The only explanation of this feature must be that the particles are surrounded by a
vacuum that is in a diﬀerent ontological state every time. A radio-active particle is con-
tinuously hit by ﬂuctuating features in its surrounding vacuum. These features represent
information that ﬂies around, and as such, must be represented by almost perfect random
number generators. The decay law (5.27) thus emerges naturally.
Thus it is inevitable that the vacuum state has to be regarded as a single template state,
which however is composed of inﬁnitely many ontological states. The states consisting of
a single particle roaming in a vacuum form a simple set of diﬀerent template states, all
orthogonal to the vacuum template state, as dictated in the Fock space description of
particle states in quantum ﬁeld theory.
77

5.7.7.
A single photon passing through a sequence of polarisers
It is always illustrative to reduce a diﬃculty to its most basic form.
The conceptual
diﬃculty one perceives in Bell’s gedanken experiment, already shows up if we consider a
single photon, passing through a sequence of polarisation ﬁlters, F1, . . . , FN . Imagine
these ﬁlters to be rotated by angles ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . , ϕN , and every time a photon hits one
of these ﬁlters, say Fn , there is a probability equal to sin2 ψn , with ψn = ϕn−1 −ϕn ,
that the photon is absorbed by this ﬁlter. Thus, the photon may be absorbed by any of
the N polarisers. What would an ontological description of such a setup be like?
Note that, the setup described here resembles our description of a radio-active par-
ticle, see the previous subsection. There, we suggested that the particle is continuously
interacting with the surrounding vacuum. Here, it is easiest to assume that the photon
interacts with all ﬁlters. The fact that the photon arrives at ﬁlter Fn as a superposition
of two states, one that will pass through and one that will be absorbed, means that,
in the language of the ontological theory, we have an initial state that we do not quite
know; there is a probability cos2 ψn that we have a photon of the pass-through type, and
a probability sin2 ψn that it is of the type that will be absorbed. If the photon passes
through, its polarisation is again well-deﬁned to be ϕn . This will determine what the
distribution is of the possible states that may or may not pass through the next ﬁlter.
We conclude that the ﬁlter, being essentially classical, can be in a very large number
of distinct ontological states. The simplest of all ontological theories would have it that
a photon arrives with polarisation angle ψn with respect to the ﬁlter. Depending on
the ontological state of the ﬁlter, we have probability cos2 ψ that the photon is allowed
through, but rotated to the direction ϕn , and probability sin2 ψ that it is absorbed (or
reﬂected and rotated).
Now, return to the two entangled photons observed by Alice and Bob in Bell’s set-
up. In the simplest of all ontological theories, this is what happens: Alice’s and Bob’s
ﬁlters act exactly as above. The two photons carry both the same information in the
form of a single angle, c . Alice’s ﬁlter has angle a , Bob’s has angle b . As we saw
in subsection 3.6.1, there is a 3-point correlation between a , b and c , given by the
mouse-dropping function, (3.26) and Fig. 5.
Now note, that the mouse-dropping function is invariant under rotations of a , b
and/or c by 90◦. The nature of the ontological state depends very precisely on the
angles a , b , and c , but each of these states diﬀers from the others by multiples of 90◦
in these angles. Therefore, as soon as we have picked the desired orthonormal basis, the
basis elements will be entirely uncorrelated. This makes the correlations unobservable
whenever we work with the templates.
Assuming the ontological conservation law at
work here, we ﬁnd that the ontological nature of the angles a , b and c is correlated,
but not the physical observables. It is to be expected that correlations of this sort will
pervade all of physics.
78

5.8.
The quantum computer
Quantum mechanics is often endowed with mysterious features. There are vigorous at-
tempts to turn some of these features to our advantage.
One famous example is the
quantum computer. The idea is to use entangled states of information carriers, which
could be photons, electrons, or something else, to represent vastly more information than
ordinary bits and bytes, and are therefore called qubits.
Since the machines that investigators plan to construct would obey ordinary quantum
mechanics, they should behave completely in accordance with our theories and models.
However, this seems to lead to contradictions.
In contrast with ordinary computers, the amount of information that can be carried
by qubits in a quantum computer, in principle, increases exponentially with the number
of cells, and consequently, it is expected that quantum computers will be able to perform
calculations that are fundamentally impossible in ordinary computers. An ordinary, clas-
sical computer would never be able to beat a quantum computer even if it took the size
of the universe, in principle.
Our problem is then, that our models underlying quantum mechanics are classical,
and therefore they can be mimicked by classical computers, even if an experimentalist
would build a ‘quantum computer’ in such a world. Something is wrong.
Quantum computers still have not been constructed however. There appear to be
numerous practical diﬃculties. One diﬃculty is the almost inevitable phenomenon of
decoherence. For a quantum computer to function impeccably, one needs to have perfect
qubits.
It is generally agreed that one cannot make perfect qubits, but what can be done is
correct them for the errors that may sometimes occur. In a regular computer, errors can
easily be corrected, by using a slight surplus of information to check for faulty memory
sites. Can the errors of qubits also be corrected? There are claims that this can be done,
but in spite of that, we still don’t have a functioning quantum computer, let alone a
quantum computer that can beat all classical computers. Our theory comes with a ﬁrm
prediction:
Yes, by making good use of quantum features, it will be possible in principle,
to build a computer vastly superior to conventional computers, but no, these
will not be able to function better than a classical computer would do, if its
memory sites would be scaled down to one per Planckian volume element (or,
in view of the holographic principle, one memory site per Planckian surface
element), and if its processing speed would increase accordingly, typically one
operation per Planckian time unit of 10−43 seconds.
Such scaled classical computers can of course not be built, so that this quantum computer
will still be allowed to perform computational miracles, but factoring a number with
millions of digits into its prime factors will not be possible – unless fundamentally improved
classical algorithms turn out to exist. If engineers ever succeed in making such quantum
79

computers, it seems to me that the CAT is falsiﬁed; no classical theory can explain
quantum mechanics.

Quantum gravity
The Planck scale has been mentioned many times already. It is the scale of time, lengths,
masses, and energies, where three grand physical theories all play equally signiﬁcant roles,
being special relativity (where the speed of light c is essential), quantum mechanics (with
Planck’s constant ℏ) and Newton’s theory of gravity (with Newton’s constant G ). Having

(6.5)
In this domain of physics, one expects Special and General Relativity and Quantum
Mechanics all to be relevant, but a complete synthesis of these three has not yet been
achieved – in fact, our continued struggle towards ﬁnding such a synthesis was one of the
main motivations for this work.
It is not unreasonable to suspect that the Planck length is the smallest signiﬁcant
length scale in physics, and the Planck time is the smallest time scale at which things
can happen, but there is more. General Relativity is known to cause space and time to
be curved, so, if one might talk of some “lattice” in space and time, curvature may be
expected to cause defects in this lattice. Alternatively, one might suspect that lattice-like
behaviour can also be realised by imposing a cutoﬀin local momentum and energy scales
(a so-called bandwidth cut-oﬀ[50]); however, with such a cut-oﬀdeterministic models are
diﬃcult to construct.
It is also important to note that General Relativity is based on the local automorphism
group. This means that time translations are locally deﬁned, so that one may expect that
gravity could be essential to realise locality requirements for the Hamiltonian.
Mass,
energy and momentum are local sources of gravitational ﬁelds, but there is more.
Gravitation is a destabilising force. Causing masses to attract one another, it gen-
erates greater masses and thus even stronger attraction. This may lead to gravitational
implosion. In contrast, electric as well as magnetic charges act repulsively (if they have
equal signs), which makes electromagnetism a lot more stable than gravity as a force
system.
80

When gravitational implosion takes place, black holes may form. Microscopic black
holes must play an essential role at the Planck scale, as they may act as virtual particles,
taking part in the vacuum ﬂuctuations. When one tries to incorporate black holes in an
all-embracing theory, diﬃculties arise. According to standard calculations, black holes
emanate elementary particles, and this eﬀect (Hawking eﬀect [28]) allows one to compute
the density of quantum states associated to black holes. This density is very large, but
as black holes increase in size, the number of states does not grow as fast as one might
expect: it grows exponentially with the size of the surface, rather than the encapsulated
volume. The quantum states that one might expect in the bulk of a black hole mysteriously
disappear,
We expect all this to produce a profound eﬀect on the putative deterministic models
that could possibly lie at the basis of quantum theory. Discreteness of space and time
comes for free, because one can also argue that the number of quantum states inside a
volume V can never exceed that of a black hole occupying V , so that the surface at
the border of V dictates how many independent ontological states are allowed inside V ,
an eﬀect called the ‘holographic principle’ [47][74]. Locality may come naturally because
of the automorphism group as mentioned. Yet space-time curvature causes problems.
Nature’s book keeping system is still very ill-understood.
7.
Information loss
Gravity is perhaps not the only reﬁnement that may guide us towards better models. An
other interesting modiﬁcation – though possibly related – might be of help. We shall now
discuss information loss. [51][79]
7.1.
Cogwheels with information loss
Let us return to the Cogwheel Model, discussed in section 2.2. The most general automa-
ton may have the property that two or more diﬀerent initial states evolve into the same
ﬁnal state. For example, we may have the following evolution law involving 5 states:
(4) →(5) →(1) →(2) →(3) →(1) .
(7.1)
The diagram for this law is a generalisation of Fig. 1, now shown in Fig. 7. We see that
in this example state #3 and state #5 both evolve into state #1.
At ﬁrst sight, one might imagine to choose the following operator as its evolution
operator:

Figure 7: a) Simple 5-state automaton model with information loss. b) Its three
equivalence classes. c) Its three energy levels.
However, since there are two states that transform into state #1 whereas there are none
that transform into state #4, this matrix is not unitary, and it cannot be written as the
exponent of −i times an Hamiltonian.
One could think of making tiny modiﬁcations in the evolution operator (7.2), since
only inﬁnitesimal changes suﬃce to ﬁnd some sort of (non hermitean) Hamiltonian of
which this then would be the exponent. This turns out not to be such a good idea. It
is better to look at the physics of such models. Physically, of course, it is easy to see
what will happen. States #4 and 5 will only be realised once if ever. As soon as we are
inside the cycle, we stay there. So it makes more sense simply to delete these two rather
spurious states.
The problem with that is that, in practice, it might be quite diﬃcult to decide which
states are inside a closed cycle, and which states descend from a state with no past
(“gardens of Eden”).
Here, it is the sequence #4, #5.
but in many more realistic
examples, the gardens of Eden will be very far in the past, and diﬃcult to trace. Our
proposal is, instead, to introduce the concept of information equivalence classes (info-
equivalence classes for short):
Two states (a) and (b) at time t0 are equivalent if there exists a time t1 > t0
such that, at time t1 , state (a) and (b) have evolved into the same state (c) .
This deﬁnition sends states #5 and #3 in our example into one equivalence class, and
therefore also states #4 and #2 together form an equivalence class. Our example has
just 3 equivalence classes, and these classes do evolve with a unitary evolution matrix,
since, by construction, their evolution is time-reversible.
Info-equivalence classes will
show some resemblance with gauge equivalence classes, and they may well actually be
quite large. Also, the concept of locality will be a bit more diﬃcult to understand, since
states that locally look quite diﬀerent may nevertheless be in the same class. Of course,
the original underlying classical model may still be completely local. Our pet example is
Conway’s game of life [22]: an arbitrary conﬁguration of ones and zeros arranged on a two-
dimensional grid evolve according to some especially chosen evolution law. The law is not
time-reversible, and information is lost at a big scale. Therefore, the equivalence classes
are all very big, but the total number of equivalence classes is also quite large, and the
model is physically non-trivial. An example of a more general model with information loss
is sketched in Figure 8. We see many equivalence classes that each may contain variable
numbers of members.
82

Figure 8:
Example of a more generic ﬁnite, deterministic, time non reversible
model. Largest (pink and blue) dots: these also represent the equivalence classes.
Smallest (green) dots: “gardens of Eden”. Heavier dots (blue): equivalence classes
that have “merge sites” among their members. The info-equivalence classes and the
energy spectrum are as in Figs. 2 and 3.
Thus, we ﬁnd how models with information loss may still be connected with quantum
mechanics:
Each info-equivalence class corresponds to an element of the ontological basis
of a quantum theory.
Can information loss be helpful? Intuitively, the idea might seem to be attractive.
Consider the measurement process, where bits of information (“qubits”) that originally
were properties of single particles, are turned into macroscopic observables. These may
be considered as being later in time, and all mergers that are likely to happen must
have taken place. In other words, the classical states are obviously represented by the
equivalence classes.
However, when we were still dealing with individual qubits, the
mergers have not yet taken place, and the equivalence classes may form very complex, in
a sense “entangled”, sets of states. Locality is then diﬃcult to incorporate in the quantum
description, so, in these models, it may be easier to expect some rather peculiar features
regarding locality – perhaps just the thing we need.
What we also need is a better understanding of black holes. The idea that black holes,
when emitting Hawking radiation, do still obey quantum unitarity, which means that the
Hamiltonian is still hermitean, is gaining in acceptance by researchers of quantum gravity,
even among string theorists. On the other hand, the classical black hole is surrounded by a
horizon from which nothing seems to be able to escape. Now, we may be able to reconcile
these apparently conﬂicting notions: the black hole is an example of a system with massive
amounts of information loss at the classical level, while the quantum mechanics of its
micro-states is nevertheless unitary.
The micro states are not the individual classical
states, but merely the equivalence classes of classical states. According to the holographic
principle, these classes are distributed across the horizon in such a way that we have one
83

bit of information for each area segment of roughly the Planck length squared. We now
interpret this by saying that all information passing through a horizon disappears, with
the exception of one bit per unit horizon area.
We return to Hawking radiation in part II, section 9.4 .
7.2.
Time reversibility of theories with information loss
Now when we do quantum mechanics, there happens to be an elegant way to restore
time reversibility. Let us start with the original evolution operator U(δt) , such as the
one shown in Eq. (7.2). It has no inverse, but, instead of U −1 , we could use U † as the
operator that brings us back in time. What it really does is the following: the operator
U †(δt) , when acting on an ontological state |ont(t0)⟩at time t0 , gives us the additive
quantum superposition of all states in the past of this state, at time t = t0 −δt . The
norm is now not conserved: if there were N states in the past of a normalised state
|ont(t0)⟩, the state produced at time t0 −δt now has norm
√
N . If the state |ont(t0)⟩
was a garden of Eden, then U †|ont(t0)⟩= 0 .
Now remember that, whenever we do quantum mechanics, we have the freedom to
switch to another basis by using unitary transformations. It so happens that with any
ontological evolution operator U1 that could be a generalisation of Eq. (7.2), there exists
a unitary matrix X with the property
U †
1 X = X U2 ,
(7.3)
where U2 again describes an ontological evolution with information loss. This is not hard
to prove. One sees right away that such a matrix X should exist by noting that U †
1 and
U2 can be brought in the same normal form. Apart from the opposite time ordering, U1
and U2 have the same equivalence classes.
Finding the unitary operator X is not quite so easy. We can show how to produce
X in a very simple example. Suppose U1 is a very simple N × N dimensional matrix
D of the form
D =




1
1

(7.4)
so D has N 1’s on the ﬁrst row, and 0’s elsewhere. This simply tells us that D sends
all states |1⟩, . . . |N⟩to the same state |1⟩.
The construction of a matrix Y obeying
D†Y = Y D ,
(7.5)
can be done explicitly. One ﬁnds
Ykℓ=
1
√
N
e2πikℓ/N .
(7.6)

Y is unitary and it satisﬁes Eq. (7.5), by inspection.
This result may come unexpected. Intuitively, one might think that information loss
will make our models non-invariant under time reversal. Yet our quantum mechanical
tool does allow us to invert such a model in time. A “quantum observer” in a model
with information loss may well establish a perfect validity of symmetries such as CPT
invariance. This is because, for a quantum observer, transformations with matrices X
merely represent a transition to another orthonormal basis; the matrix Y is basically the
discrete Fourier transform matrix. Note that merger states (see Fig. 8) transform into
Gardens of Eden, and vice versa.
7.3.
The arrow of time
One of the surprising things that came out of this research is a new view on the arrow
of time. It has been a long standing mystery that the local laws of physics appear to be
perfectly time-reversible, while large-scale, classical physics is not at all time-reversible.
Is this not a clash with the reduction principle? If large-scale physics can be deduced
from small-scale physics, then how do we deduce the fact that the second law of thermo-
dynamics dictates that entropy of a closed system can only increase and never decrease?
Most physicists are not really worried by this curious fact. In the past, this author
always explained the ‘arrow of time’ by observing that, although the small-scale laws of
nature are time-reversible, the boundary conditions are not: the state of the universe was
dictated at time t = 0 , the Big Bang. The entropy of the initial state was very small,
probably just zero. There cannot be any boundary condition at the Big Apocalypse,
t = t∞.
So, there is asymmetry in time and that is that.
For some reason, some
researchers are not content with such a simple answer.
We now have a more radical idea: the microscopic laws may not at all be time-
reversible. The classical theory underlying quantum mechanics does not have to be, see
subsection 7.1. Then, in subsection 7.2, we showed that, even if the classical equations
feature information loss at a great scale – so that only tiny fractions of information are
preserved – the emerging quantum mechanical laws continue to be exactly time-reversible,
so that, as long as we adhere to a description of things in terms of Hilbert space, we cannot
understand the source of time asymmetry.
However, the classical, ontological states are very asymmetric in time, because, as we
stated, these are directly linked to the underlying classical degrees of freedom.
All this might make information loss acceptable in theories underlying quantum the-
ory.
Note, furthermore, that our distinction of the ontological states should be kept,
because classical states are ontological. Ontological states no not transform into onto-
logical states under time reversal, since the transformation operators X and Y involve
quantum superpositions. In contrast, templates are transformed into templates. This
means automatically that classical states (see section 4.2), are not invariant under time
reversal. Indeed, they do not look invariant under time reversal, since classical states
typically obey the rules of thermodynamics.
85

The quantum equations of our world are invariant (more precisely: covariant) under
time reversal, but neither the sub-microscopical world, where the most fundamental laws
of nature reign, nor the classical world allow for time reversal.
Our introduction of information loss may have an other advantage: two states may
be seen to be in the same equivalence class even if we cannot follow the evolution very
far back in time. In practice, one might suspect that the likelihood of two distinct states
to actually be in one equivalence class, will diminish rapidly with time; these states
will show more and more diﬀerences at diﬀerent locations. This means that we expect
physically relevant equivalence classes to be related by transformations that still look
local at the particle scale that can presently be explored experimentally. This brings us
to the observation that local gauge equivalence classes might actually be identiﬁed with
information equivalence classes. It is still (far) beyond our present mathematical skills to
investigate this possibility.
Finally, note that info-equivalence classes may induce a subtle kind of apparent non-
locality in our eﬀective quantum theory, a kind of non-locality that may help to accept
the violation of Bell’s theorem (section 3.6).
The explicit models we studied so-far usually do not have information loss. This is
because the mathematics will be a lot harder; we simply have not yet been able to use
information loss in our more physically relevant examples.
7.4.
Information loss and thermodynamics
There is yet another important novelty when we allow for information loss, in particular
when it happens at a large scale (such as what we expect when black holes emerge, see
above). Neither the operator U nor U † are unitary now. In the example of Eq. (7.4),
one ﬁnds
D D† = N|1⟩⟨1| ,
D†D = N|e⟩⟨e| ,
(7.7)
where |e⟩is the normalised state
|e⟩=
1
√
N ( |1⟩+ · · · X|N⟩)
(7.8)
(which shows that the matrix Y here must map the state |1⟩onto the state |e⟩. Note,
that D and D† are in the same conjugacy class). Thus, during the evolution, the state
|1⟩may become more probable, while the probabilities of all other states dwindle to zero.
Some equivalence classes may gain lots of members this way, while others may stay quite
small. In large systems, it is unlikely that the probability of a class vanishes altogether,
so it might become possible to write the amplitudes as
e−iHt−1
2 βE ,
(7.9)
where one might be tempted to interpret the quantity E as a (classical) energy, and
1
2β
as an imaginary component of time. This aspect of our theory is still highly specula-
tive. Allowing time to obtain complex values can be an important instrument to help us
understand the reasons why energy has a lower bound.
86

More problems
It may take years, decades, perhaps centuries to arrive at a comprehensive theory of
quantum gravity, combined with a theory of quantum matter that will be an elaborate
extension of the Standard Model. Only then will we have the opportunity to isolate the
beables that are the basic ingredients for an ontological theory; the templates of that
theory will be projected onto the beable basis. Only then can we tell whether the CAI
really works. Conceivably however, we may be able to use the CAI as a guide to arrive
at such theories. That was the main motivation for writing this book.
8.1.
What will be the CA for the SM?
There are numerous problems remaining.
The ﬁrst of these was encountered by the
author right-away: how to convince a majority of researchers who have been working in
this ﬁeld for many decades, that the views expressed here may well be basically correct.
In particular we state the most important conclusions:
– there’s only a single, essentially classical, discrete, universe, not an inﬁnity of distinct
universes, as advocated in the Many World Interpretation, whether or not being
guided by a pilot wave that is active in all those worlds.
– The Born probabilities hold exactly true, requiring no corrections of any form, since
they were put in the state vectors (templates) to describe the probability distribu-
tion of the initial states. What has been put in, comes out unchanged: the Born
probabilities.
– The “collapse of the wave function” takes place automatically, without requiring
any corrections to Schr¨odinger’s equation, such as non-linearities. This is because
the universe is in a single ontological state from the Big Bang onwards, whereas the
ﬁnal result of an experiment will also always be a single ontological state. The ﬁnal
state can never be in a superposition, such as a live cat superimposed with a dead
cat.
– The underlying theory may well be a local one, but the transformation of the classical
equations into the much more eﬃcient quantum equations, involves some degree of
non-locality, which leaves no trace in the physical equations, apart from the well-
known, apparent ‘quantum miracles’.
– It is very much worth-while to search for more models where the transformation can
be worked out in detail; this could lead to a next generation of Standard Models,
with ‘cellular automaton restrictions’ that can be tested experimentally.
The problem how to set up such searches in a systematic way is very challenging indeed.
Presumably a procedure corresponding to second quantisation has to be employed, but
as yet it is only clear how to do this for fermionic ﬁelds. The problem is then that we
87

also must replace the Dirac equation for the ﬁrst-quantised particles into deterministic
ones. This could be done for free, massless particles, which is not a bad start, but it is
also not good enough to proceed. Then, we have some rudimentary ideas about bosonic
force-carrying ﬁelds, as well as a suggestive string-like excitation (worked out further in
part II ), but again, it is not known yet how to combine these into something that can
compete with the Standard Model known today.
8.2.
The Hierarchy Problem
There is a deeper reason why any detailed theory involving the Planck scale, quantum
mechanics and relativity, may be extremely diﬃcult to formulate. This is the empirical
fact that there are two or more radically diﬀerent scales of very special signiﬁcance: the
Planck scale and the mass scale(s) of the most signiﬁcant particles in the system. The
amazing thing about our world as that these various scales are many orders of magnitude
apart. The Planck scale is at ≈1019 GeV, the nuclear scale is at ≈1 GeV, while there
are also electrons, and ﬁnally neutrinos at some 10−11 GeV.
The origin of these large numbers, which are essential for the universe to function
the way it does, is still entirely obscure. We could add to this that there are very few
experiments that reach accuracies better than 1 part in 1011 , let alone 1019 , so that it is
questionable whether any of the fundamental principles pertaining to one scale, are still
valid at an other – they could well be, but everything could also be diﬀerent. There is no
lack of speculative ideas to explain the origins of these numbers. The simplest observation
one can make is that fairly down-to-earth mathematics can easily generate numbers of
such magnitudes, but to make them arise naturally in fundamental theories of nature is
not easy at all.
Most theories of Planck scale physics, such as superstring theory and loop quantum
gravity, make no mention of the origins of large numbers, whereas, we believe, good
theories should23. In discrete cellular automata, one can certainly observe that, if lattices
in space and time play any role, there may be special things happening when the lattice
is exactly regular – such lattices have zero curvature. The curvature of our universe is
extremely tiny, being controlled by numbers even more extreme than the hierarchy scales
mentioned: the cosmological constant is described by a dimensionless number of the order
of 10−122 . This might mean that, indeed, we are dealing with a regular lattice, but it
must accommodate for rare lattice defects.
In general, a universal theory must explain the occurrence of very rare events, such as
the mass terms causing zitterbewegung in fermions such as electrons. We do believe that
cellular automaton models are in a good position to allow for special events that are very
rare, but it is far too early to try to understand these.
In short, the most natural way to incorporate hierarchies of scales in our theory is not
23An important exception is the theory of the anthropic principle, the idea that some numbers are
very large or very small, just because these would be the only values that can yield planets with civilised
creatures (anthropoi) on them. This notion has been around for some time, but, understandably, it does
not gather much adherence.

clear.

Alleys to be further investigated, and open questions
9.1.
Positivity of the Hamiltonian
As we shall argue at length in Part II, it is quite likely that the gravitational force will be
a crucial ingredient in resolving the remaining diﬃculties in the CAT theory. One of the
various arguments for this is that gravity is partly based on the existence of local time
translations, which are redeﬁnitions of time that depend on the location in space. The
generator for these transformations is the Hamiltonian density, which here must be a local
operator. At the same time, it is important also for gravity theory to have a lower bound
on energy density. Apparently, gravity hinges exactly on those two important demands
on the Hamiltonian operator that are causing us some troubles, and so, conceivably, the
problem of quantising gravity and the problem of turning quantum mechanics into a
deterministic theory for dynamics, will have to be solved together.
On the other hand one might argue that the non-locality of the quantum-induced
Hamiltonian is exactly what we need to explain away Bell’s theorem.
The exact position of the gravitational force in our theory is not completely clear.
Therefore, one might hope that the inclusion of a gravitational force can be postponed,
and that cellular automaton models exist also on ﬂat space-time lattices. In part II, we
shall see that our PQ formalism, chapter 16, allows us to split space-like coordinates
into two parts: integers that specify the location of a point on a lattice, and fractional,
or periodic, coordinates that could be used to position a point within one lattice cell, or
else merely play the role of canonically conjugated variables associated to a discretised
momentum variable. Here, hoever, accommodating for non-compact symmetries such as
Lorentz invariance is extremely diﬃcult.
The most obnoxious, recurring question will be that the Hamiltonians reproduced in
our models, more often than not, appear to lack a lower bound. This problem will be
further studied in part II, chapters 14, 22, and in section 19.1. The properties that seem
to raise conﬂicts when combined, are
1. H must be constant in time:
d
dtH = 0 ,
(9.1)
2. H must be bounded from below:
⟨ψ | H | ψ ⟩≥0 ,
(9.2)
3. H should be extensive, that is, it must be the sum (or integral) of local terms:
H =
X
⃗x
H(⃗x) ,
(9.3)
89

4. And ﬁnally, it must generate the equations of motion:
U(t) = e−iH t ,
(9.4)
or equivalently, for all states | ψ ⟩in Hilbert space,
d
dt| ψ ⟩= −iH | ψ ⟩.
(9.5)
If we take just any classical model, we usually have no diﬃculty ﬁnding an operator H
that generates the evolution law (9.5), but then it often does not automatically obey both
(9.2) and (9.3).
All these equations are absolutely crucial for understanding quantum mechanics. In
particular, the importance of the bound (9.2) is sometimes underestimated. If the bound
would not have been there, none of the familiar solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation
would be stable; any, inﬁnitesimally tiny, perturbation in H would result in a solution
with energy E that decays into a combination of two spatially separated solutions with
energies E + δE and −δE .
All solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation would have such instabilities, which would
describe a world quite diﬀerent from the quantum world we are used to.
This is the reason why we always try to ﬁnd an expression for H such that a lower
bound exists (which we can subsequently normalise to be exactly zero). From a formal
point of view, it should be easy to ﬁnd such a Hamiltonian. Every classical model should
allow for a description in the form of the simple models of section 2.2.1, a collection of
cogwheels, and we see in Fig. 3 that we can subsequently adjust the constants δEi so
that the bound (9.2) exists, even if there are inﬁnitely many cogwheels with unlimited
numbers of teeth.
However, also the third condition is needed. H(⃗x ) is the Hamiltonian density. Local-
ity amounts to the demand that, at distances exceeding some close distance limit, these
Hamilton densities must commute (Eq. 5.20).
One may suspect that the ultimate solution that obeys all our demands will come from
quantising gravity, where we know that there must exist a local Hamiltonian density that
generates local time diﬀeomorphisms. In other treatises on the interpretation of quantum
mechanics, this important role that might be played by the gravitational force is rarely
mentioned.
Some authors do suspect that gravity is a new elementary source of ‘quantum deco-
herence’, but such phrases are hardly convincing. In these arguments, gravity is treated
perturbatively (Newton’s law is handled as an additive force, while black holes and scat-
tering between gravitational waves are ignored).
As a perturbative, long-range force,
gravity is in no fundamental way diﬀerent from electromagnetic forces. Decoherence [45]
is a concept that we completely avoid here (see section 3.5).
Since we have not solved the Hamiltonian positivity problem completely, we have no
systematic procedure to control the kind of Hamiltonians that can be generated from
cellular automata.
Ideally, we should try to approximate the Hamiltonian density of
90

the Standard Model.
Having approximate solutions that only marginally violate our
requirements will not be of much help, because of the hierarchy problem, see subsection 8.2:
the Standard Model Hamiltonian (or what we usually put in its place, its Lagrangian),
requires ﬁne tuning. This means that very tiny mismatches at the Planck scale will lead
to very large errors at the Standard Model scale. The hierarchy problem has not been
solved, so this indeed gives us an other obstacle.
9.2.
Second quantisation in a deterministic theory
When Dirac arrived at the famous Dirac equation to describe the wave function of an
electron, he realised that he had a problem: the equation allows for positive energy
solutions, but these are mirrored by solutions where the energy, including the rest-mass
energy, is negative. The relativistic expression for the energy of a particle with momentum
⃗p (in units where the speed of light c = 1 ), is
E = ±
p
m2 + ⃗p 2 .
(9.6)
If a partial diﬀerential equation gives such an expression with a square root, it is practically
impossible to impose conditions on the wave function such that the unwanted negative
sign is excluded, unless such a condition would be allowed to be a non-local one, a price
Dirac was not prepared to pay. He saw a more natural way out:
There are very many electrons, and the N -electron solution obeys Pauli’s
principle: the wave function must switch sign under interchange of any pair
of electrons. In practice this means that all electrons each must occupy diﬀer-
ent energy levels. Levels occupied by one electron cannot be reached by other
electrons. Thus, Dirac imagined that all negative energy levels are normally
ﬁlled by electrons, so that others cannot get there. The vacuum state is by def-
inition the lowest energy state, so the negative-energy levels are all occupied
there. If you put an extra electron in a positive energy level, or of you remove
an electron from a negative energy spot, then in both cases you get a higher
energy state.
If an electron is removed from a negative energy level, the empty spot there carries a net
energy that is positive now. Its charge would be opposite to that of an electron. Thus,
Dirac predicted an antiparticle associated to the electron24: a particle with mass me and
charge +e , where normal electrons have mass me and charge −e . Thus, the positron
was predicted.
In cellular automata we have the same problem. In section 14, it is explained why we
cannot put the edge of the energy spectrum of an automaton where we would like to put
it: at zero energy, the vacuum state, which would then naturally be the lowest energy
24Dirac ﬁrst thought that this might be the proton, but that was untenable; the mass had to be equal
to the electron mass, and the positron and the electron should be able to annihilate one another when
they come close together.
91

state. We saw that locality demands a very smooth energy function. If we symmetrise
the spectrum, such that −π < E δt < π , we get the same problem that Dirac had to
cope with, and indeed, we can use the same solution: second quantisation. How it works
will be explained in section 15. We take k fermionic particles, which each can occupy N
states. If we diagonalise the U operator for each ‘particle’, we ﬁnd that half of the states
have positive energy, half negative. If we choose k = 1
2N , the lowest energy state has all
negative energy levels ﬁlled, all positive energies empty; this is the lowest energy state,
the vacuum.
The excited states are obtained if we deviate slightly from the vacuum conﬁguration.
This means that we work with the energy levels close to the center of the spectrum, where
we see that the Fourier expansions of section 14 still converge rapidly. Thus, we obtain a
description of a world where all net energies are positive, while rapid convergence of the
Fourier expansion guarantees eﬀective locality.
Is this then the perfect solution to our problem? Nearly, but not quite. First, we
only ﬁnd justiﬁable descriptions of second quantised fermions. The bosonic case will be
more subtle, and is not yet quite understood25 Secondly, we have to replace the Dirac
equation by some deterministic evolution law, while a deterministic theory to be exposed
in section 15.2 describes sheets, not particles. We do not know how to describe local
deterministic interactions between such sheets. What we have now, is a description of
non-interacting particles. Before introducing interactions that are also deterministic, the
sheet equations will have to be replaced by something diﬀerent.
Supposing this problem can be addressed, we work out the formalism for interactions
in subsection 22.1. The interaction Hamiltonian is obtained from the deterministic law
for the interactions using a BCH expansion, which is not guaranteed to converge. This
may be not a problem if the interaction is weak. We bring forward arguments why, in
that case, convergence may still be fast enough to obtain a useful theory. The theory is
then not inﬁnitely accurate, but this is not surprising. We could state that, indeed, that
problem was with us all along in quantum ﬁeld theory: the perturbative expansion of the
theory is ﬁne, and it gives answers that are much more precise that the numbers that
can be obtained from any experiment, but they are not inﬁnitely precise, just because
perturbation expansion does not converge (it can be seen to be merely an asymptotic
expansion). Thus, our theory reproduces exactly what is known about quantum mechanics
and quantum ﬁeld theory, just telling us that if we want a more accurate description, we
might have to look at the original automaton itself.
Needless to emphasise, that some of the ideas brought forward here are mostly spec-
ulation, they should still be corroborated by more explicit calculations and models.
25But we made a good start: bosons are the energy quanta of harmonic oscillators, which we should ﬁrst
replace by harmonic rotators, see chapters 12.1—13. Our diﬃculty is to construct harmonically coupled
chains of such rotators. Our procedures worked reasonably well in one space-, one time dimension, but
we do not have a bosonic equivalent of the neutrino model (section 15.2), for example.
92

9.3.
Information loss and time inversion
A very important observation made in section 7 is that, if we introduce information loss in
the deterministic model, the total number of orthogonal basis elements of the ontological
basis may be considerable reduced, while nevertheless the resulting quantum system will
not show any signs of time irreversibility. The classical states however, referring to mea-
surement results and the like, are linked to the original ontological states, and therefore
do possess a thermodynamical arrow of time.
This may well explain why we have time non reversibility at large, classical scales
while the microscopic laws as far they are known today, still seem to be perfectly time
reversible.
To handle the occurrence of information loss at the sub-microscopic level, we intro-
duced the notion of info-equivalence classes: all states that, within a certain ﬁnite amount
of time evolve into the same ontological state |ψ(t)⟩, are called info-equivalent, all being
represented as the same quantum basis element |ψ(0)⟩. We already alluded to the simi-
larity between the info-equivalence classes and the local gauge equivalence classes. Could
it be that we are therefore talking about the same thing?
If so, this would mean that local gauge transformations of some state represented as an
ontological state, may actually describe diﬀerent ontological states at a given time t = t0 ,
while two ontic states that diﬀer from one another only by a local gauge transformation,
may have the property that they both will evolve into the same ﬁnal state, which naturally
explains why observers will be unable to distinguish them.
Now we are aware of the fact that these statements are about something being funda-
mentally unobservable, so their relevance may certainly be questioned.
Nevertheless this suggestion is justiﬁable, as follows. One may observe that formulat-
ing quantum ﬁeld theory without employing the local gauge-equivalence principle, appears
to be almost impossible26, so the existence of local gauge equivalence classes can be as-
cribed to the mathematical properties of these quantised ﬁelds.
Only rarely can one
replace a theory with local gauge equivalence by one where this feature is absent or of
a totally diﬀerent nature27. Exactly the same can be said about ontological equivalence
classes. They will be equally unobservable at large scales – by deﬁnition. Yet rephrasing
the deterministic theory while avoiding these equivalence classes altogether may be pro-
hibitively diﬃcult (even if it is not principally excluded). So our argument is simply this:
these equivalence classes are so similar in nature, that they may have a common origin.
This then leaves an exciting question: general relativity is also based on a local gauge
principle: the equivalence of locally curved coordinate frames. Can we say the same thing
about that gauge equivalence class? Could it also be due to information loss? This would
mean that our underlying theory should be phrased in a ﬁxed local coordinate frame.
General coordinate invariance would then be ascribed to the fact that the information
that determines our local coordinates is something that can get lost.
Is such an idea
26The interactions would have to be kept quite weak, such as the electro-magnetic ones.
27Examples are known, in the form of dual transformations.
93

viable? Should we investigate this?
My answer is a resounding yes! This could clarify some of the mysteries in today’s
general relativity and cosmology. Why is the cosmological constant so small? Why is
the universe spatially ﬂat (apart from local ﬂuctuations)? And, regarding our cellular
automaton: How should we describe an automaton in curved space-time?
The answers to these questions are then: yes, our universe is curved, but the curvature
is limited to local eﬀects. We do have an important variable playing the role of a metric
tensor gµν(⃗x, t) in our automaton, but it lives in a well-deﬁne coordinate frame, which is
ﬂat. Take a gauge condition obeying gi0 = gi0 = 0, i = 1, 2, 3. Let then λi be the three
eigenvalues of gij , the space-like components of the inverse metric (so that (λi)−1 ≡λi
are the eigenvalues of gij ). Let λ0 = |g00| . Then the local speed of light, in terms of the
coordinates used, is given by c2 = |⃗λ|/λ0 . We can impose an inequality on c : assume
that the values of the metric tensor are constrained to obey |c| ≤1 . If now we write
gµν = ω2(⃗x, t)ˆgµν , with a constraint on ˆgµν such as det(ˆgµν) = −1 (See Appendix B),
then there is no limitation on the value of ω . This means that the universe can inﬂate
towards any size, but on the average it may stay ﬂat.
We continue this subject in subsection 22.4.
9.4.
Holography and Hawking radiation
There is an other reason to expect information loss to be an inescapable feature of an
ultimate theory of physics, which concerns microscopic black holes. Classically, black
holes absorb information, so, one may have to expect that our classical, or ‘pre-quantum’
system also features information loss. Even more compelling is the original idea of holog-
raphy [47][74].
It was Stephen Hawking’s important derivation that black holes emit
particles [28], due to quantum ﬂuctuations near the horizon. However, his observation
appeared to lead to a paradox:
The calculation suggests that the particles emerge in a thermal state, with
perfect randomness, regardless how the black hole was formed. Not only in
deterministic theories, but also in pure quantum theories, the arrangement of
the particles coming out should depend to some extent on the particles that
went in to form a black hole.
In fact, one expects that the state of all particles emerging from the black hole should
be related to the state of all particles that formed the black hole by means of a unitary
matrix, the scattering matrix S . [68][71]
Properties of this matrix S can be derived using physical arguments [77]. One uses the
fact that particles coming out must have crossed all particles that went in, and this involves
the conventional scattering matrix determined by their “Standard Model” interactions.
Now since the centre-of-mass energies involved here are often much larger than anything
that has been tested in laboratories, much stays uncertain about this theory, but in general
one can make some important deductions:
94

The only events that are relevant to the black hole’s reaction upon the particles
that went in, take place in the region very close to the event horizon. This
horizon is two-dimensional.
This means that all information that is processed in the vicinity of a black hole, must be
eﬀectively represented at the black hole horizon. Hawking’s expression for the black hole
entropy resulting from his analysis of the radiation clearly indicates that it leaves only
one bit of information on every surface element of roughly the Planck length squared. In
natural units:
S = πR2 = log(W) = (log 2) 2log W ;
W = 2Σ/4 log 2 ,
(9.7)
where Σ = 4πR2 is the surface area of the horizon.
Where did the information that went into the bulk of space-time inside a black hole
go? We think it was lost. If we phrase the situation this way, we can have holography
without losing locality of the physical evolution law. This evolution law apparently is
extremely eﬀective in destroying information.28
Now we can add to this that we cannot conceive of a conﬁguration of matter in space-
time that is such that it contains more information per unit of volume than a black with
radius corresponding to the total energy of the matter inside. Therefore the black hole
obeys the Bekenstein limit [30]:
the maximum amount of information that ﬁts inside a (spherical) volume V
is given by the entropy of the largest black hole that ﬁts inside V .
Information loss in a local ﬁeld theory must then be regarded in the following way (“holog-
raphy”):
In any ﬁnite, simply connected region of space, the information contained in
the bulk gradually disappears, but what sits at the surface will continue to be
accessible, so that the information at the surface can be used to characterise
the info-equivalence classes.
At ﬁrst sight, using these info-equivalence classes to represent the basis elements of a
quantum description may seem to be a big departure from our original theory, but we have
to realise that, if information gets lost at the Planck scale, it will be much more diﬃcult
to lose any information at much larger scales; there are so many degrees of freedom that
erasing information completely is very hard and improbable; rather, we are dealing with
the question how exactly information is represented, and how exactly do we count bits of
information in the info-equivalence classes.
28Please do not confuse this statement with the question whether quantum information is lost near a
black hole horizon. According to the hypothesis phrased here, quantum information is what is left if we
erase all redundant information by combining states in equivalence classes. The black hole micro states
then correspond to these equivalence classes. By construction, equivalence classes do not get lost.
95

Note that, in practice, when we study matter in the universe, the amount of energy
considered is far less that what would correspond to a black hole occupying the entire
volume of space. So in most practical cases, the Bekenstein limit is not signiﬁcant, but we
have to remember that, in those cases, we always consider matter that is still very close
to the vacuum state.
Information loss is mostly a local feature; globally, information is preserved. This does
mean that our identiﬁcation of the basis elements of Hilbert space with info-equivalence
classes appears to be not completely local. On the other hand, both the classical theory
and the quantum theory naturally forbid information to be spread faster than the speed
of light.
Let us end this subsection with our view on the origin of Hawking radiation. The
physical laws near the horizon of a black hole should be derived from the laws controlling
the vacuum state as seen by an observer falling in. This vacuum is in a single quantum
state, but consists of myriads of ontological states, distinguishable by considering all
conceivable ﬂuctuations of the physical ﬁelds. Normally, all these states form a single
equivalence class.
At the horizon, however, signals entering the black hole cannot return, so the mix-
ture of the information that causes all these states to form a single equivalence class, is
rearranged substantially by the presence of the black hole, so much so that, as seen by
the distant observer, not a single equivalence class is experienced, but very many classes.
Thus, the vacuum is replaced by the much larger Hilbert space spanned by all these
classes. They together form the rich spectrum of physical particles seen to emerge from
the black hole.

Conclusions
In an earlier version of this text, a sub title was added to the title of this book: A view on
the quantum nature of our universe. This raised objections: “your view seems to be more
classical than anything we’ve seen before!” Actually, this can be disputed. We argue that
classical underlying laws can be turned into quantum mechanical ones practically without
leaving any trace. We insist that it is real quantum mechanics that comes out, including
all “quantum weirdness”. The nature of our universe is quantum mechanical, but it may
have a classical explanation. The underlying classical laws may be seen to be completely
classical. We show how ‘quantum mechanical’ probabilities can originate from completely
classical probabilities.
It may seem odd that our theory, unlike most other approaches, does not contain
any strange kinds of stochastic diﬀerential equations, no “quantum logic”, not an inﬁnity
of other universes, no pilot wave, just completely ordinary equations of motion that we
have hardly been able to specify, as they could be almost anything. Our most essential
point is that we should not be deterred by ‘no go theorems’ if these contain small print
and emotional ingredients in their arguments.
The small print that we detect is the
assumed absence of strong local as well as non-local correlations in the initial state. Our
96

models show that there should be such strong correlations. Correlations do not require
superluminal signals, let alone signals going backwards in time.
The emotional ingredient is the idea that the conservation of the ontological nature
of a wave function would require some kind of ‘conspiracy’, as it is deemed unbelievable
that the laws of nature themselves can take care of that. Our point is that they obviously
can. Once we realise this, we can consider studying very simple local theories.
In principle it is almost trivial to obtain “quantum mechanics” out of classical theories.
We demonstrated how it can be done with a system as classical as the Newtonian planets
moving around the sun.
But then diﬃculties do arise, which of course explain why
our proposal is not so simple after all. The positivity of the Hamiltonian is one of the
prime stumbling blocks. We can enforce it, but then the plausibility of our models needs
to be scrutinised. At the very end we have to concede that the issue will most likely
involve the mysteries of quantum gravity. Our present understanding of quantum gravity
suggests that discretised information is spread out in a curved space-time manifold; this
is diﬃcult to reconcile with nature’s various continuous symmetry properties such as
Lorentz invariance. So, yes, it is diﬃcult to get these issues correct, but we suggest that
these diﬃculties will only indirectly be linked to the problem of interpreting quantum
mechanics.
This book is about these questions, but also about the tools needed to address them;
they are the tools of conventional quantum mechanics, such as symmetry groups and
Noether’s theorem.
A distinction should be made between on the one hand explicit theories concerning
the fate of quantum mechanics at the tiniest meaningful distance scale in physics, and on
the other hand proposals for the interpretation of today’s ﬁndings concerning quantum
phenomena.
Our theories concerning the smallest scale of natural phenomena are still very incom-
plete. Superstring theory has come a long way, but seems to make our view more opaque
than desired; in any case, in this book we investigated only rather simplistic models, of
which it is at least clear what they say.
10.1.
The CAI
What we found, seems to be more than suﬃcient to extract a succinct interpretation of
what quantum mechanics really is about. The technical details of the underlying theory
do not make much diﬀerence here.
All one needs to assume is that some ontological
theory exists; it will be a theory that describes phenomena at a very tiny distance scale
in terms of evolution laws that process bits and bytes of information. These evolution
laws may be “as local as possible”, requiring only nearest neighbours to interact directly.
The information is also strictly discrete, in the sense that every “Planckian” volume of
space may harbour only a few bits and bytes. We also suspect that the bits and bytes are
processed as a function of local time, in the sense that only a ﬁnite amount of information
processing can take place in a ﬁnite space-time 4-volume. On the other hand, one might
97

suspect that some form of information loss takes place such that information may be
regarded to occupy surface elements rather than volume elements, but this we could not
elaborate very far.
In any case, in its most basic form, this local theory of information being processed,
does not require any Hilbert space or superposition principles to be properly formulated.
The bits and bytes we discuss are classical bits and bytes; at the most basic level of
physics (but only there), qubits do not play any role, in contrast with more standard
approaches considered in today’s literature. Hilbert space only enters when we wish to
apply powerful mathematical machinery to address the question how these evolution laws
generate large scale behaviour, possibly collective behaviour, of the data.
Our theory for the interpretation of what we observe is now clear: humanity discovered
that phenomena at the distance and energy scale of the Standard Model (which comprises
distances vastly larger, and energies far smaller, than the Planck scale) can be captured
by postulating the eﬀectiveness of templates. Templates are elements of Hilbert space that
form a basis that can be chosen in numbers of ways (particles, ﬁelds, entangled objects,
etc.), which allow us to compute the collective behaviour of solutions to the evolution
equations that do require the use of Hilbert space and linear operations in that space. The
original observables, the beables, can all be expressed as superpositions of our templates.
Which superpositions one should use, diﬀers form place to place. This is weird but not
inconceivable. Apparently there exists a powerful scheme of symmetry transformations
allowing us to use the same templates under many diﬀerent circumstances. The rule for
transforming beables to templates and back is complex and not unambiguous; exactly
how the rules are to be formulated, for all objects we know about in the universe, is not
known or understood, but must be left for further research.
Most importantly, the original ontological beables do not allow for any superposition,
just as we cannot superimpose planets, but the templates, with which we compare the
beables, are elements of Hilbert space and require the well-known principles of superpo-
sition.
The second element in our CAI is that objects we normally call classical, such as plan-
ets and people, but also the dials and all other detectable signals coming from measure-
ment devices, can be directly derived from beables, in principle without the intervention
of the templates.
Of course, if we want to know how our measurement devices work, we use our tem-
plates, and this is the origin of the usual “measurement problem”. What is often portrayed
as mysteries in quantum theory: the measurement problem, the ‘collapse of the wave func-
tion’, and Schr¨odinger’s cat, is completely clariﬁed in the CAI. All wave functions that
will ever occur in our world, may seem to be superpositions of our templates, but they are
completely peaked, ‘collapsed’, as soon as we use the beable basis. Since classical devices
are also peaked in the beable basis, their wave functions are collapsed. No violation of
Schr¨odinger’s equation is required for that, on the contrary, the templates, and indirectly,
also the beables, exactly obey the Schr¨odinger equation.
In short, it is not nature’s degrees of freedom themselves that allow for superposition,
98

it is the templates we normally use that are man-made superpositions of nature’s onto-
logical states. The fact that we hit upon the apparently inevitable paradoxes concerning
superposition of the natural states, is due to our intuitive thinking that our templates
represent reality in some way. If, instead, we start from the ontological states that we
may one day succeed to characterise, the so-called ‘quantum mysteries’ will disappear.
10.2.
Counterfactual deﬁniteness
Suppose we have an operator Oop
1
whose value cannot be measured since the value of
another operator, Oop
2 , has been measured, while [Oop
1 , Oop
2 ] ̸= 0 . Counterfactual reality
is the assumption that, nevertheless, the operator Oop
1
takes some value, even if we
don’t know it. It is often assumed that hidden variable theories imply counterfactual
deﬁniteness. We should emphasise categorically that no such assumption is made in the
Cellular Automaton Interpretation. In this theory, the operator Oop
2 , whose value has
been measured, apparently turned out to be composed of ontological observables (beables).
Operator Oop
1
is, by deﬁnition, not ontological and therefore has no well-deﬁned value,
for the same reason why, in the planetary system, the Earth-Mars interchange operator,
whose eigenvalues are ±1 , has neither of these values; it is unspeciﬁed, in spite of the
fact that planets evolve classically, and in spite of the fact that the Copenhagen doctrine
would dictate that these eigenvalues are observable!
The tricky thing about the CAI when applied to atoms and molecules, is that one often
does not know a priori which of our operators are beables and which are changeables
or superimposables (as deﬁned in subsections 2.1.1 and 5.5.1). One only knows this a
posteriori, and one might wonder why this is so. We are using templates to describe
atoms and molecules, and these templates give us such a thoroughly mixed up view of
the complete set of observables in a theory that we are left in the dark, until someone
decides to measure something.
It looks as if the simple act of a measurement sends a signal backwards in time and/or
with superluminal speed to other parts of the universe, to inform observers there which
of their observables can be measured and which not. Of course, that is not what hap-
pens. What happens is that now we know what can be measured accurately and which
measurements will give uncertain results. The Bell and CHSH inequalities are violated as
they should be in quantum ﬁeld theory, while nevertheless quantum ﬁeld theory forbids
the possibility to send signals faster than light or back to the past.
10.3.
Superdeterminism and conspiracy
Superdeterminism may be deﬁned to imply that not only all physical phenomena are
declared to be direct consequences of physical laws that do not leave anything anywhere
to chance (which we refer to as ‘determinism’), but it also emphasises that the observers
themselves behave in accordance with the same laws.
They also cannot perform any
whimsical act without any cause in the near past as well as in the distant past. By itself,
this statement is so obvious that little discussion would be required to justify it, but what
99

makes it more special is that it makes a diﬀerence. The fact that an observer cannot
reset his or her measuring device without changing physical states in the past is usually
thought not to be relevant for our description of physical laws. The CAI claims that it is.
Further explanations will be given in subsection 10.3.4, where we attempt to demystify
‘free will’.
It is often argued that, if we want any superdeterministic phenomenon to lead to vio-
lations of the Bell-CHSH inequalities, this would require conspiracy between the decaying
atom observed and the processes occurring in the minds of Alice and Bob, which would
be a conspiracy of a kind that should not be tolerated in any decent theory of natural
law. The whole idea that a natural mechanism could exist that drives Alice’s and Bob’s
behaviour is often found diﬃcult to accept.
In the CAI, however, natural law forbids the emergence of states where beables are
superimposed. Neither Alice nor Bob will ever be able to produce such states by rotating
their polarisation ﬁlters. Indeed, the state their minds are in, are ontological in terms of
the beables, and they will not be able to change that.
Superdeterminism has to be viewed in relation with correlations over space-like dis-
tances. We claim that not only there are correlations, but the correlations are also ex-
tremely strong. The state we call ‘vacuum state’ is full of correlations. Quantum ﬁeld
theory (to be discussed in part II, section 20), must be a direct consequence of the under-
lying ontological theory. It explains these correlations. All 2-particle expectation values,
called propagators, are non-vanishing outside the light cone.
Also the many-particle
expectation values are non-vanishing there; indeed, by analytic continuation, these am-
plitudes are seen to turn into the complete scattering matrix, which encapsulates all laws
of physics that are implied by the theory. In chapter 3.6, it is shown how a 3-point cor-
relation can, in principle, generate the violation of the CHSH inequality, as required by
quantum mechanics.
In view of these correlation functions, and the law that says that beables will never
superimpose, we now suspect that this law forbids Alice and Bob to both change their
minds in such a way that these correlation functions would no longer hold.
10.3.1.
The role of entanglement
We shall not claim that these should be the last words on Bell’s interesting theorem.
Indeed, we could rephrase our observations in a somewhat diﬀerent way. The reason why
the standard, Copenhagen theory of quantum mechanics violates Bell is simply that the
two photons (or electrons, or whatever the particles are that are being considered), are
quantum entangled. In the standard theory, it is assumed that Alice may change her
mind about her setting without aﬀecting the photon that is on its way to Bob. Is this
still possible if Alice’s photon and Bob’s photon are entangled?
According to the CAI, we have been using templates to describe the entangled photons
Alice and Bob are looking at, and this leads to the violation of the CHSH inequalities. In
reality, these templates were reﬂecting the relative correlations of the ontological variables
underlying these photons. To describe entangled states as beables, their correlations are
100

essential.
We assume that this is the case when particles decay into entangled pairs
because the decay has to be attributed to vacuum ﬂuctuations (see section 5.7.5), while
also the vacuum cannot be a single, translation invariant, ontological state.
Resetting Alice’s experiment without making changes near Bob would lead to a state
that, in quantum mechanical terms, is not orthogonal to the original one, and therefore
not ontological. The fact that the new state is not orthogonal to the previous one is quite
in line with the standard quantum mechanical descriptions; after all, Alice’s photon was
replaced by a superposition.
The question remains how this could be. If the cellular automaton stays as it is near
Bob, why is the ‘counterfactual’ state not orthogonal to it? The CAI says so, since the
classical conﬁguration of her apparatus has changed, and we stated that any change in
the classical setting leads to a change in the ontological state, which is a transition to an
orthogonal vector in Hilbert space.
We cannot exclude the possibility that the apparent non-locality in the ontic – template
mapping is related to the diﬃculty of identifying the right Hamiltonian for the standard
quantum theory, in terms of the ontic states. We should ﬁnd a Hamiltonian that is the
integral of a local Hamiltonian density. Strictly speaking, there may be a complication
here; the Hamiltonian we use in is often an approximation, a very good one, but it ignores
some subtle non-local eﬀects. This will be further explained in part II.
10.3.2.
Choosing a basis
Some physicists of previous generations thought that distinguishing diﬀerent basis sets
is very important. Are particles ‘real particles’ in momentum space or in conﬁguration
space? Which are the ‘true’ variables of electro-magnetism, the photons or the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds? The modern view is to emphasise that, any basis serves our purposes
as well as any other, since, usually, none of the conventionally chosen basis spaces is truly
ontological.
In this respect, Hilbert space should be treated as any ordinary vector space, such
as the space in which each of the coordinates of the planets in our planetary system are
deﬁned. It makes no diﬀerence which coordinate frame we use. Should the z -axis be
orthogonal to the local surface of the earth? Parallel to the earth’s axis of rotation? The
ecliptic? Of course, the choice of coordinates is immaterial. Clearly, this is exempliﬁed
in Dirac’s notation. This beautiful notation is extremely general and as such it is quite
suitable for the discussions presented in this book.
But then, after we declared all sets of basis elements to be as good as any other, in as far
as they describe some familiar physical process or event, we venture into speculating that a
more special basis choice can be made. A basis could exist in which all super-microscopic
physical observables are beables; these are the observable features at the Planck scale,
they all must be diagonal in this basis. Also, in this basis, the wave function only consists
of zeros and a single one. It is ontological. This special basis, called ‘ontological basis’,
101

is hidden from us today but it should be possible to identify such a basis29, in principle.
This book is about the search for such a basis. It is not the basis of the particles, the
ﬁelds of the particles, of atoms or molecules, but something considerably more diﬃcult to
put our hands on.
The reader may be surprised when we emphasise that also all classical states, describ-
ing stars and planets, automobiles, people, and eventually pointers on detectors, will be
diagonal in the same ontological basis. Why is that? It is of crucial importance, and it
was explained in section 4.2.
10.3.3.
Correlations and hidden information
An essential element in our analysis may be the observations expressed in Subsection 3.6.2.
It was noted that the details of the ontological basis must carry crucial information about
the future, yet in a concealed manner: the information is non-local. It is a simple fact that,
in all of our models, the ontological nature of a state the universe is in, will be conserved
in time: once we are in a well-deﬁned ontological state, as opposed to a template, this
feature will be preserved in time (the ontology conservation law). It prevents Alice and
Bob from choosing any setting that would ‘measure’ a template that is not ontological.
Thus, this feature prevents counterfactual deﬁniteness. Even the droppings of a mouse
cannot disobey this principle.
In adopting the CAI, we except the idea that all events in this universe are highly
correlated, but in a way that we cannot exploit in practice. It would be fair to say that
these features still carry a sense of mystery that needs to be investigated more, but the
only way to do this is to search for more advanced models.
10.3.4.
Free Will
The notion of “free will” can be confusing. At some occasions, the discussion seems to
border to a religious one. It should be quite clear that the theories of nature discussed in
this book, have nothing to do with religion, and so we must formulate in a more concrete
manner what is meant by “free will”.
The idea that we call ‘free will’ is actually extremely simple, in principle. What one
might expect in a theory is that:
the theory predicts how its variables evolve, in an unambiguous way, from any
chosen initial state.
In a Bell-type experiment, suppose we start from a conﬁguration with given settings a
and b of Alice’s and Bob’s ﬁlters. We see entangled particles moving from the source
to the two detectors, What ‘free will’ then means is that our theory not only yields a
unique prediction for this setting, but it should also give a unique prediction of what
happens when we look at a diﬀerent initial state, such as the one we get if we make a
29There may be more than one, non equivalent choices, as explained later (section 22.3).
102

slight modiﬁcation in Alice’s setting a , without modifying anything in the approaching
particles or Bob’s setting b .
We then don’t care to check which modiﬁcations would be needed in the past events
to realise this particular modiﬁcation. The theory should produce a prediction. However,
Bell derived his inequalities for the outcomes of diﬀerent initial states that he chose, and
these inequalities are violated by quantum mechanics.
We derived in subsection 3.6.1 that, in order to reproduce the quantum mechanical
result, the probabilities of the settings a, b and c must be correlated, and the correlation
function associated to one simple model was calculated. Here we see how, in principle,
the notion of free will as given above can be obstructed:
If a modiﬁcation is made in the given values of the kinetic variables, they might
have a much larger or smaller probability than the original conﬁguration.
The correlation function we found describes 3-point correlations. All two-point correla-
tions vanish.
What happens if we follow a conﬁguration back to the past, if it violates the Bell-
or CHSH inequalities? In that case, the quantum state of the entangled photons will no
longer be as it was originally prepared: a state where the total spin of the two particles is
zero (an S-state). In the case of photons, a D-state with total spin s=2 is formed. Thus,
by choosing a diﬀerent setting, either Alice or Bob modiﬁed the states of the photons
they are detecting. Following this s = 2 state back to the past, we do not see a simple
decaying atom, but a much less probable state of photons bouncing oﬀthe atom, refusing
to perform the assumed decay process backwards in time. Thermodynamically, this is a
much less probable initial state, let us call it the counterfactual initial state.
This counterfactual initial state will be an entirely legal one in terms of the microscopic
laws of physics, but probably not at all in terms of the macroscopic laws, in particular,
thermodynamics. What this argument shows is that, Bell’s theorem requires more hidden
assumptions than usually thought: The quantum theory only contradicts the classical one
if we assume that the ‘counterfactual modiﬁcation’ does not violate the laws of thermody-
namics.
In our models, we must assume, it does. Inevitably, a more ‘probable’ modiﬁcation
of the settings does turn the photon state into a diﬀerent one. At ﬁrst sight, this seems
odd: the modiﬁcation was made in one of the settings, not in the approaching photons.
However, we must admit that the photons described in quantum mechanical language,
are in template states; the ontological states, forming an orthonormal set, must involve
many more ontological degrees of freedom than just these two photons, just in order to
stay orthonormal.
10.4.
The importance of second quantisation
We fully realise that any attempts to explain the surprising outcome of Bell’s Gedanken
experiment will be received with suspicion unless more speciﬁc models can be constructed
103

where solid calculations support our ﬁndings. We have speciﬁc models, but so-far, these
have been less than ideal to explain our points. What would really be needed is a model
or a set of models that obviously obey quantum mechanical equations, while they are
classical and deterministic in their set-up. Ideally, we should ﬁnd models that reproduce
relativistic, quantised ﬁeld theories with interactions, such as the Standard Model.
The use of second quantisation, will be explained further in subsections 15.2.3 and
22.1 of part II. We start with the free Hamiltonian and insert the interactions at a later
stage, a procedure that is normally assumed to be possible using perturbation expansion.
The trick used here is, that the free particle theory will be manifestly local, and also the
interactions, represented by rare transitions, will be local. The interactions are introduced
by postulating new transitions that create or annihilate particles. All terms in this expan-
sion are local, so we have a local Hamiltonian. To handle the complete theory, one then
has to do the full perturbation expansion. Obeying all the rules of quantum perturbation
theory, we should obtain a description of the entire, interacting model in quantum terms.
Indeed, we should reproduce a genuine quantum ﬁeld theory this way.
Is this really true? Strictly speaking, the perturbation expansion does not converge,
as is explained also in section 22.1. However, then we can argue that this is a normal
situation in quantum ﬁeld theory. Perturbation expansions formally always diverge, but
they are the best we have – indeed they allow us to do extremely accurate calculations in
practice. Therefore, reproducing these perturbative expansions, regardless how well they
converge, is all we need to do in our quantum theories.
A fundamentally convergent expression for the Hamiltonian does exist, but it is entirely
diﬀerent. The diﬀerences are in non-local terms, which we normally do not observe. Look
at the exact expression, Eq. (2.8), ﬁrst treated in section 2.1 of chapter 2:
Hop δt = π −i
∞
X
n=1
1
n (Uop(n δt) −Uop(−n δt)) .
(10.1)
This converges, except for the vacuum state itself. Low energy states, states very close
to the vacuum, are the states where convergence is excessively slow. Consequently, as was
explained before, terms that are extremely non-local, sneak in.
This does not mean that the cellular automaton would be non-local; it is as local
as it can be, but it means that if we wish to describe it with inﬁnite precision in quan-
tum mechanical terms, the Hamiltonian may generate non-localities. One can view these
non-localities as resulting from the fact that our Hamiltonian replaces time diﬀerence
equations, linking instances separated by integral multiples of δt , by diﬀerential equa-
tions in time; the states in between the well-deﬁned time spots are necessarily non-local
functions of the physically relevant states.
It is these non-localities that may well be responsible for being sensitive to Bob’s
and Alice’s environment. Or in diﬀerent words: if we modify Alice’s settings by rotating
her polariser, without modifying the state near Bob, we may well generate a state with
excessively high energy.
One might argue that there should be no reason to try to ﬁll the gaps between integer
104

times steps, but then there would not exist an additive energy function, which we need
to stabilise the solutions of or equations. Possibly, we have to use a combination of a
classical, integer-valued Hamilton function (chapter 19 of part II ), and the periodically
deﬁned Hamiltonian linking only integer-valued time steps, but exactly how to do this
correctly is still under investigation. We have not yet found the best possible approach
towards constructing the desired Hamilton operator for our template states. The second-
quantised theory that will be further discussed is presently our best attempt, but we have
not yet been able to reproduce the quite complex symmetry structure of the Standard
Model, in particular Poincar´e invariance.
As long as we have no explicit model that, to the extent needed, reproduces Standard
Model-like interactions, we cannot verify the correctness of our approach. Lacking that,
what has to be done next is the calculations in models that are as realistic as possible.
Part II
Calculation Techniques
11.
Introduction to part II
Many of the technical calculations and arguments mentioned in part I of this book, were
postponed to the second part, so as to make the ﬁrst part easier to read while keeping it
coherent, and to give some nice ﬁrework in the second part. The price we pay for this is
that there will be a number of repetitions, for which we apologise.
11.1.
Outline of part II
One of our main themes is that quantum mechanics may be viewed as a mathematical tool
rather than a new theory of physical phenomena. Indeed, in condensed matter theory,
several models exist where the physical setup and the questions asked are fundamen-
tally classical, yet the calculations are performed by regarding the system as a quantum
mechanical one. The Ising Model is a beautiful example of this.[9]
There is no better way to illustrate our approach than by actually showing how such
calculations are done. The Cogwheel Model was already introduced in section 2.2. Now,
in chapters 12.1—13, we show some more of our mathematical tools, how to construct
quantum Hamiltonians and how to approach continuum limits. Here, the cogwheel model
is linked to the harmonic rotator, but also other, notoriously ‘classical’ structures, such as
the planetary system, are transformed into models that appear to be quantum mechanical.
105

The continuum limit of a single, periodic cogwheel is an important example. It ap-
proaches the ordinary quantum harmonic oscillator with the same period T . The con-
tinuum cogwheel is actually a smoothly rotating wheel. Is the classical rotating wheel
equivalent to a quantum harmonic oscillator? In a sense, yes, but there are some sub-
tleties that one has to be aware of. This is why we decided to do this limit in two steps:
ﬁrst transform the cogwheel into a harmonic rotator, allowing the teeth to form a repre-
sentation of the group SU(2) , and only then consider the continuum limit. This enables
us to recognise the operators x and p of a genuine harmonic oscillator already in ﬁnite
cogwheels.
Like other technical calculations elsewhere in this book, they were done on order
to check the internal consistency of the systems under study. It was fun to do these
calculations, but they are not intended to discourage the reader. Just skip them, if you
are more interested in the general picture.
The issue of the locality of the Hamiltonian is further treated in chapter 14. It will
come up frequently in almost any deterministic model, and again the mathematics is
interesting. We observe that a lot depends on the construction of the vacuum state. It is
the state of lowest energy, and the solution of the equation “energy = lowest”, generates
non-localities indeed. In reality, as is well known in quantum ﬁeld theories, signals will not
go faster than the speed of light. What will be shown in this chapter is that there is a way
to avoid non-localities when objects move around surrounded by a vacuum, provided one
uses a ﬁrst-quantised theory where only the center part of the energy spectrum is used.
Consequently, energy can be positive or negative there. Subsequently, one introduces anti-
particles, such that the negative energy states actually represent holes of antiparticles. It
is nothing but Dirac’s trick to ensure that the physical vacuum has lowest possible energy.
Dirac ﬁrst phrased his theory for fermionic particles. Indeed, fermions are easier to
understand in this respect that bosons are. Therefore, we ﬁrst introduce fermions as an
essential element in our models, see chapter 15.
It so happens that Dirac’s equation for the electron is well suited to demonstrate our
prescription of searching for “beables” in a quantum theory. Section 15.2 also begins at
an easy pace but ends up in lengthy derivations. Here also, the reader is invited to enjoy
the intricate features of the ‘neutrino’ model, but they can just as well be skipped.
We take the simpliﬁed case of the Dirac equation for a two-component neutrino. It
is fundamentally simpler than the Dirac equation for the electron.
Furthermore, we
assume the absence of interactions. The math starts out simple, but the result is striking:
neutrinos are conﬁgurations of ﬂat membranes, or ‘sheets’, rather than particles. the
sheets move around classically. This is not a theory but a mathematical fact, as long as
we keep mass terms and interactions out of the picture; these are left for later.
Having observed this, we asked the question how to go from the sheet variables back to
the neutrino’s quantum operators such as position ⃗x , momentum ⃗p , and spin ⃗σ . Here,
the math does become complicated, and it is interesting as an exercise (subsections 15.2.1
and 15.2.2). The neutrinos are ideal for the application of second quantisation (subsection
15.2.3), although, in this language, we cannot yet introduce interactions for them.
106

Our models, discussed in chapters 12–17 and 19, have in common that they are local,
realistic, and based on conventional procedures in physics. They also have in common
that they are limited in scope, they do not capture all features known to exist in the
real world, such as all particle species, all symmetry groups, and in particular special and
general relativity. The models should be utterly transparent, they indicate directions that
one should look at, and, as was our primary goal, they suggest a great approach towards
interpreting the quantum mechanical laws that are all so familiar to us.
PQ theory, chapter 16 is a ﬁrst attempt to understand links between theories based on
real numbers and theories based on integer, or discrete, numbers. The idea is to set up a
clean formalism connecting the two, so that it can be used in many instances. Chapter 16
also shows some nice mathematical features, with good use of the elliptic theta functions.
The calculations look more complicated than they should be, just because we searched
for an elegant mechanism relating the real line to pairs of integers on the one hand and
the torus on the other, keeping the symmetry between coordinates and momenta.
In chapter 17, we found some other interesting extensions of what was done in chap-
ter 16. A very straightforward argument drew our interest to String Theory and Super-
string Theory. We are not strongly advocating the idea that the only way to do interesting
physics at the Planck scale is to believe what string theoreticians tell us. It is not clear
from our work that such theories are the way to go, but we do notice that our program
shows remarkable links with string theory. In the absence of interactions, the local equa-
tions of string- and superstring theory appear to allow the construction of beables, exactly
along the route that we advocate. The most striking feature exposed here, is that strings,
written in the usual form of continuous quantum ﬁeld theories in one space, and one time
dimension, map onto classical string theories that are not deﬁned in a continuous target
space, but on a space-time lattice, where the lattice spacing a is given as a = 2π
√
α′ .
Symmetries, discussed in chapter 18, are diﬃcult to understand in the CA Interpre-
tation of quantum mechanics.
However, in the CAI, symmetry considerations are as
important as anywhere else in physics. Most of our symmetries are discrete, but in some
cases, notably in string theory, continuous symmetries such as the Poincar´e group, can
be recovered.
In chapter 19, we address the positivity problem of the Hamiltonian from a diﬀerent
perspective.
There, the usual Hamiltonian formalism is extended to include discrete
variables, again in pairs Pi, Qi , evolving in discrete time. When we ﬁrst tried to study
this, it seemed like a nightmare, but it so happens that the ‘discrete Hamilton formalism’
comes out to be almost as elegant as the usual diﬀerential form. And indeed here, the
Hamiltonian can easily be chosen to be bounded from below.
Eventually, we wish to reproduce eﬀective laws of Nature that should take the form of
today’s quantum ﬁeld theories. This is still quite diﬃcult. It was the reason for setting up
our procedures in a formal way, so that we will keep the ﬂexibility to adapt our systems
to what Nature seems to be telling us through the numerous ingenious experiments that
have been performed. We explain some of the most important features of quantum ﬁeld
theory in chapter 20.
Most notably: in quantum ﬁeld theories, no signal can carry
useful information faster than the speed of light, and probabilities always add up to one.
107

Quantum ﬁeld theory is entirely local, in its own inimitable quantum way. These features
we would like to reproduce in a deterministic quantum theory.
To set up the Cellular Automaton Interpretation in more detail, we ﬁrst elaborate
some technical issues in cellular automata in general (chapter 21). These are not the
technicalities encountered when computer programs are written for such systems; software
experts will not understand much of our analysis.
This is because we are aiming at
understanding how such systems may generate quantum mechanics at the very large
time and distance limit, and how we may be able to connect to elementary particle
physics. What we ﬁnd is a beautiful expression for a quantum Hamiltonian, in terms of
an expansion called the BCH expansion. Everything would have been perfect if this were
a convergent expansion.
However, it is easy to see that the expansion is not convergent. We try a number of
alternative approaches with some modest successes, but not all issues will be resolved,
and the suspicion is aired concerning the source of our diﬃculties: quantum gravitational
eﬀects may be of crucial importance, while it is exactly these eﬀects that are still not
understood as well as is needed here. We do propose to use the BCH expansion for many
classes of cellular automata to demonstrate how they could be used to interpret quantum
mechanics. I know that the details are not yet quite right, but this probably has to be
attributed to the simple fact that we left out lots of things, notably special and general
relativity
11.2.
Notation
It is diﬃcult keep our notation completely unambiguous. In chapter 16, we are dealing
with many diﬀerent types of variables and operators. When a dynamical variable is an
integer there, we shall use capitals A, B, · · · , P, Q, · · · . Variables that are periodic with
period 2π , or at least constrained to lie in an interval such as (−π, π] , are angles, mostly
denoted by Greek lower case letters α, β, · · · , κ, θ, · · · , whereas real variables will most
often be denoted by lower case Latin letters a, b, · · · , x, y, · · · . Yet sometimes we run out
of symbols and deviate from this scheme, if it seems to be harmless to do so. For instance,
indices will still be i, j, · · · for space-like vector components, α, β, · · · for spinors and
µ, ν, · · · for Lorentz indices. The Greek letters ψ and ϕ will be used for wave functions
as well.
Yet it is diﬃcult to keep our notation completely consistent; in some chapters before
chapter 16, we use the quantum numbers ℓand m of the SU(2) representations to
denote the integers that earlier were denoted as k or k −m , and later in chapter 16
replaced by capitals.
As in part I, we use a super- or subscript “op” to distinguish an operator from an
ordinary numerical variable. The caret (ˆ) will be reserved for vectors with length one,
the arrow for more general vectors, not necessarily restricted to three dimensional space.
Only in chapter 20, where norms of vectors do not arise, we use the caret for the Fourier
transform of a function.
108

Dirac’s constant ℏand the velocity of light c will nearly always be deﬁned to be one
in the units chosen. In previous work, we used a spacial symbol to denote e2π as an
alternative basis for exponential functions. This would indeed sometimes be useful for
calculations, when we use fractions that lie between 0 and 1, rather than angles, and it
would require that we normalise Planck’s original constant h rather then ℏto one, but
in the present monograph we return to the more usual notation.
Concepts frequently discussed are the following:
- discrete variables are variables such as the integer numbers, whose possible values
can be counted. Opposed to continuous variables, which are typically represented
by real or complex numbers.
- fractional variables are variables that take values in a ﬁnite interval or on a circle.
The interval may be [0, 1) , [0, 2π) , (−1
2, 1
2] , or (−π, π] . Here, the square bracket
indicates a bound whose value itself may be included, a round bracket excludes
that value. A real number can always be decomposed into an integer (or discrete)
number and a fractional one.
- a theory is ontological, or ‘ontic’, if it only describes ‘really existing’ objects; it is
simply a classical theory such as the planetary system, in the absence of quantum
mechanics. The theory does not require the introduction of Hilbert space, although,
as will be explained, Hilbert space might be very useful. But then, the theory is
formulated in terms of observables that are commuting at all times.
- a feature is counterfactual when it is assumed to exist even if, for fundamental
reasons, it cannot actually be observed; if one would try to observe it, some other
feature might no longer be observable and hence become counterfactual. This sit-
uation typically occurs if one considers the measurement of two or more operators
that do not commute. More often, in our models, we shall encounter features that
are not allowed to be counterfactual.
- We talk of templates when we describe particles and ﬁelds as solutions of Schr¨o-
dinger’s equation in an ontological model, as was explained in subsection 4.3.1.
Templates may be superpositions of ontic states and/or other templates, but the
ontic states all form an orthonormal set; superpositions of ontic states are never
ontic themselves.
11.3.
More on Dirac’s notation for quantum mechanics
A denumerable set of states |ei⟩is called an orthonormal basis of H if every state |ψ⟩∈H
can be approximated by a linear combination of a ﬁnite number of states |ei⟩up to any
required precision:
|ψ⟩=
N(ε)
X
i=1
λi|ei⟩+ |ε⟩,
∥ε∥2 = ⟨ε|ε⟩< ε2 ,
for any ε > 0 .
(11.1)
109

(a property called ‘completeness’), while
⟨ei|ej⟩= δij
(11.2)
(called ‘orthonormality’). From Eqs. (11.1) and (11.2), one derives
λi = ⟨ei|ψ⟩,
X
i
|ei⟩⟨ei| = I ,
(11.3)
where I is the identity operator: I|ψ⟩= |ψ⟩for all |ψ⟩.
In many cases, the discrete sum in Eqs. (11.1) and (11.3) will be replaced by an
integral, and the Kronecker delta δij in Eq. (11.2) by a Dirac delta function, δ(x1 −x2) .
We shall still call the states |e(x)⟩a basis, although it is not denumerable.
A typical example is the set of wave functions ψ(⃗x) describing a particle in position
space. They are regarded as vectors in Hilbert space where the set of delta peak wave
functions |⃗x⟩is chosen to be the basis:
ψ(⃗x) ≡⟨⃗x|ψ⟩,
⟨⃗x|⃗x ′⟩= δ3(⃗x −⃗x ′) .
(11.4)
The Fourier transformation is now a simple rotation in Hilbert space, or a transition to
the momentum basis:
⟨⃗x|ψ⟩=
Z
d3⃗p ⟨⃗x|⃗p ⟩⟨⃗p |ψ⟩;
⟨⃗x|⃗p ⟩=
1
(2π)3/2 ei⃗p·⃗x .
(11.5)
Many special functions, such as the Hermite, Laguerre, Legendre, and Bessel functions,
may be seen as generating diﬀerent sets of basis elements of Hilbert space.
Often, we use product Hilbert spaces: H1 ⊗H2 = H3 , which means that states |φ⟩
in H3 can be seen as normal products of states |ψ(1)⟩in H1 and |ψ(2)⟩in H2 :
|φ⟩= |ψ(1)⟩|ψ(2)⟩,
(11.6)
and a basis for H3 can be obtained by combining a basis in H1 with one in H2 :
|e(3)
ij ⟩= |e(1)
i ⟩|e(2)
j ⟩.
(11.7)
Often, some or all of these factor Hilbert spaces are ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces,
which of course also allow all the above manipulations30. We have, for example, the 2-
dimensional vector space spanned by spin 1
2 particles. A basis is formed by the two states
| ↑⟩and | ↓⟩. In this basis, the Pauli matrices σop
1,2,3 are deﬁned as in part I, Eqs. 1.7.

will also include the ﬁnite dimensional cases.

.
Dirac derived the words ‘bra’ and ‘ket’ from the fact that the expectation value for an
operator Oop can be written as the operator between brackets, or
⟨Oop⟩= ⟨ψ| Oop|ψ⟩.
(11.9)
More generally, we shall often need the matrix elements of an operator in a basis {|ei⟩} :
Oij = ⟨ei|Oop|ej⟩.
(11.10)
The transformation from one basis {|ei⟩} to another, {|e′
i⟩} is a unitary operator Uij :
|e′
i⟩=

Uij|ej⟩,
Uij = ⟨ej|e′
i⟩;
X
k
UikUjk =
X
k
⟨e′
i|ek⟩⟨ek|e′
j⟩= δij .
(11.11)
This will be used frequently. For instance, the Fourier transform is unitary:
Z
d3⃗p ⟨⃗x|⃗p ⟩⟨⃗p |⃗x′⟩=
1
(2π)3
Z
d3⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x−i⃗p·⃗x′ = δ3(⃗x −⃗x′) .
(11.12)
The Schr¨odinger equation will be written as:
d
dt|ψ(t)⟩= −iHop|ψ(t)⟩,
d
dt⟨ψ(t)| = ⟨ψ(t)|iHop ;
|ψ(t)⟩= e−iHop t|ψ(0)⟩,
(11.13)
where Hop is the Hamiltonian, deﬁned by its matrix elements Hij = ⟨ei|Hop|ej⟩.
Dirac’s notation may be used to describe non-relativistic wave functions in three space
dimensions, in position space, in momentum space or in some other basis, such as a partial
wave expansion, it can be used for particles with spin, it can be used in many-particle
systems, and also for quantised ﬁelds in solid state theory or in elementary particle theory.
The transition from a Fock space notation, where the basis is spanned by states containing
a ﬁxed number N of particles (in position or in momentum space, possibly having spin
as well), to a notation where the basis is spanned by the functions representing the ﬁelds
of these particles, is simply a rotation in Hilbert space, from one basis into another.

More on cogwheels
12.1.
the group SU(2) , and the harmonic rotator
Let us return to the original cogwheel with N teeth, as introduced in chapter 2, section
2.2. It may be very illuminating to deﬁne the constant ℓ= (N −1)/2 , and introduce the
111

operators L1, L2 and L3 as follows ( k = 0, 1, · · · , 2 ℓis the energy quantum number;
the time step is δt = 1 ):
L3 =
N
2πHop −ℓ= k −ℓ,
L1 =
1
2(L+ + L−) ,
L2 = −1
2i (L+ −L−) ,
L+|k⟩H =
p
(k + 1)(2ℓ−k) |k + 1⟩H ,
L−|k⟩H =
p
k(2ℓ+ 1 −k) |k −1⟩H .
(12.1)
Using the quantum number m = k −ℓ= L3 , we get the more familiar expressions for
the angular momentum operators La, a = 1, 2, 3, obeying the commutation relations
[La, Lb] = iεabcLc .
(12.2)
The original ontological states |n⟩ont can be obtained from the angular momentum states
by means of the transformation rules (2.21) and (2.22). It is only these that evolve as
ontological states. Other operators can be very useful, however. Take, for instance,
x =
1
√
ℓL1 ,
p = −1
√
ℓL2 ,
[x, p] = i(1 −2ℓ+1
2πℓHop) ,
(12.3)
then, for states where the energy ⟨Hop⟩≪1 , we have the familiar commutation rules for
positions x and momenta p , while the relation L2
1 + L2
2 + L2
3 = L2 = ℓ(ℓ+ 1) implies
that, when ⟨Hop⟩≪1/
√
ℓ,
H →2π
N
1
2(p2 + x2 −1) ,
(12.4)
which is the Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator (the zero point energy has been
subtracted, as the lowest energy eigen state was set at the value zero).
Also, at low
values for the energy quantum number k , we see that L± approach the creation and
annihilation operators of the harmonic oscillator (see Eqs. (12.1)):
L−→
√
2ℓ+ 1 a ,
L+ →
√
2ℓ+ 1 a† .
(12.5)
Thus, we see that the lowest energy states of the cogwheel approach the lowest energy
states of the harmonic oscillator. This will be a very useful observation if we wish to
construct models for quantum ﬁeld theories, starting from deterministic cogwheels. The
model described by eqs. (12.1)–(12.3) will be referred to as the harmonic rotator. The
Zeeman atom of section 2.2 is a simple example with ℓ= 1 .
Note, that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of the harmonic rotator is exactly that of
the harmonic oscillator, except that there is an upper limit, Hop < 2π . By construction,
the period T = (2 ℓ+ 1)δt of the harmonic rotator, as well as that of the harmonic
oscillator, is exactly that of the periodic cogwheel.
The Hamiltonian that we associate to the harmonic rotator is also that for a spinning
object that exhibits precession due to a torque force on its axis. Thus, physically, we see
that an oscillator drawing circles in its (x, p) phase space is here replaced by a precessing
top. At the lowest energy levels, they obey the same equations.
112

We conclude from this section that a cogwheel with N states can be regarded as a
representation of the group SU(2) with total angular momentum ℓ, and N = 2 ℓ+1 . The
importance of this approach is that the representation is a unitary one, and that there
is a natural ground state, the ground state of the harmonic oscillator. In contrast to the
harmonic oscillator, the harmonic rotator also has an upper bound to its Hamiltonian.
The usual annihilation and creation operators, a and a† , are replaced by L−and L+ ,
whose commutator is not longer constant but proportional to L3 , and therefore changing
sign for states |k⟩with ℓ< k ≤2ℓ. This sign change assures that the spectrum is
bounded from below as well as above, as a consequence of the modiﬁed algebra, (12.2).
12.2.
Inﬁnite, discrete cogwheels
Discrete models with inﬁnitely many states may have the new feature that some orbits
may not be periodic. They then contain at least one non-periodic ‘rack’. There exists
a universal deﬁnition of a quantum Hamiltonian for this general case, though it is not
unique. Deﬁning the time reversible evolution operator over the smallest discrete time
step to be an operator Uop(1) , we now construct the simplest Hamiltonian Hop such
that Uop(1) = e−iHop . For this, we use the evolution over n steps, where n is positive
or negative:
Uop(n) = Uop(1)n = e−inHop .
(12.6)
Let us assume that the eigenvalues ω of this Hamiltonian lie between 0 and 2π . We can
then consider the Hamiltonian in the basis where both U(1) and H are diagonal. Write
e−inω = cos(nω) −i sin(nω) ,
(12.7)
and then use Fourier transformations to derive that, if −π < x < π ,
x = 2
∞
X
n=1
(−1)n−1 sin(nx)

(12.8)
Next, write Hop = ω = x + π , to ﬁnd that Eq. (12.8) gives
ω = π −2
∞
X
n=1
sin(nω)
n
.
(12.9)
Consequently, as in Eq. (2.8),

and
Hop
=

i
n ( Uop(n δt) −Uop(−n δt) ) .
(12.10)
Very often, we will not be content with this Hamiltonian, as it has no eigenvalues beyond
the range (0, 2π) . As soon as there are conserved quantities, one can add functions of
113

these at will to the Hamiltonian, to be compared with what is often done with chemical
potentials. Cellular automata in general will exhibit many such conservation laws. See
Fig. 3, where every closed orbit represents something that is conserved: the label of the
orbit.
In section 13, we consider the other continuum limit, which is the limit δt →0 for
the cogwheel model. First, we look at continuous theories more generally.
12.3.
Automata that are continuous in time
In the physical world, we have no direct indication that time is truly discrete.
It is
therefore tempting to consider the limit δt →0 . At ﬁrst sight, one might think that this
limit should be the same as having a continuous degree of freedom obeying diﬀerential
equations in time, but this is not quite so, as will be explained later in this chapter.
First, in this section, we consider the strictly continuous deterministic systems. Then, we
compare those with the continuum limit of discrete systems.
Consider an ontological theory described by having a continuous, multi-dimensional
space of degrees of freedom ⃗q (t) , depending on one continuous time variable t , and its
time evolution following classical diﬀerential equations:
d
dtqi(t) = fi(⃗q ) ,
(12.11)
where fi(⃗q ) may be almost any function of the variables qj .
An example is the description of massive objects obeying classical mechanics in N
dimensions. Let a = 1, · · · , N, and i = 1, · · · , 2N :
{i} = {a} ⊕{a + N} ,
qa(t) = xa(t) ,
qa+N(t) = pa(t) ,
fa(⃗q ) = ∂Hclass(⃗x, ⃗p )
∂pa
,
fa+N(⃗q ) = −∂Hclass(⃗x, ⃗p )
∂xa
,
(12.12)
where Hclass is the classical Hamiltonian.
An other example is the quantum wave function of a particle in one dimension:
{i} = {x} ,
qi(t) = ψ(x, t) ;
fi(⃗q ) = −iHS ψ(x, t) ,
(12.13)
where now HS is the Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian. Note, however, that, in this case, the
function ψ(x, t) would be treated as an ontological object, so that the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion and the Hamiltonian eventually obtained will be quite diﬀerent from the Schr¨odinger
equation we start oﬀwith; actually it will look more like the corresponding second quan-
tised system (see later).
We are now interested in turning Eq. (12.11) into a quantum system by changing the
notation, not the physics. The ontological basis is then the set of states |⃗q ⟩, obeying the
orthogonality property
⟨⃗q |⃗q ′⟩= δN(⃗q −⃗q ′) ,
(12.14)
114

where δ is now the Dirac delta distribution, and N is the dimensionality of the vectors
⃗q .
If we wrote
d
dtψ(⃗q ) ?= −fi(⃗q ) ∂
∂qi
ψ(⃗q ) ?= −iHop ψ(⃗q ) ,
(12.15)
where the index i is summed over, we would read oﬀthat
Hop ?= −ifi(⃗q ) ∂
∂qi
= fi(⃗q )pi ,
pi = −i ∂
∂qi
.
(12.16)
This, however, is not quite the right Hamiltonian because it may violate hermiticity:
Hop ̸= H†
op . The correct Hamiltonian is obtained if we impose that probabilities are pre-
served, so that, in case the Jacobian of ⃗f(⃗q ) does not vanish, the integral
R
dN⃗q ψ†(⃗q ) ψ(⃗q )
is still conserved:
d
dtψ(⃗q
=
−fi(⃗q ) ∂
∂qi
ψ(⃗q ) −1

∂fi(⃗q )

ψ(⃗q ) = −iHop ψ(⃗q ) ,

∂fi(⃗q )
∂qi

=
1
2(fi(⃗q )pi + pifi(⃗q )) ≡
1
2{fi(⃗q ), pi} .
(12.18)
The
1/2 in Eq. (12.17) ensures that the product ψ† ψ evolves with the right Jacobian.
Note that this Hamiltonian is hermitean, and the evolution equation (12.11) follows im-
mediately from the commutation rules
[qi, pj] = iδij ;
d
dtOop(t) = −i[Oop , Hop ] .
(12.19)
Now, however, we encounter a very important diﬃculty: this Hamiltonian has no lower
bound. It therefore cannot be used to stabilise the wave functions. Without lower bound,
one cannot do thermodynamics. This feature would turn our model into something very
unlike quantum mechanics as we know it.
If we take ⃗q space either one-dimensional, or in some cases two-dimensional, we can
make our system periodic. Then let T be the smallest positive number such that
⃗q (T) = ⃗q (0) .
(12.20)
We have consequently
e−iHT|⃗q (0)⟩= |⃗q(0) ⟩,
(12.21)
and therefore, on these states,
Hop |⃗q ⟩=
∞
X
n=−∞
2πn
T |n⟩H H⟨n|⃗q ⟩.
(12.22)
115

Thus, the spectrum of eigenvalues of the energy eigenstates |n⟩H runs over all integers
from −∞to ∞.
In the discrete case, the Hamiltonian has a ﬁnite number of eigenstates, with eigenval-
ues 2πk/(Nδt) + δE where k = 0, · · · , N −1 , which means that they lie in an interval
[δE , 2π/T + δE] , where T is the period, and δE can be freely chosen. So here, we
always have a lower bound, and the state with that energy can be called ‘ground state’
or ‘vacuum’.
Depending on how the continuum limit is taken, we may or may not preserve this
lower bound. The lower bound on the energy seems to be artiﬁcial, because all energy
eigenstates look exactly alike. It is here that the SU(2) formulation for harmonic rotators,
handled in subsection 12.1, may be hore useful
An other remedy against this problem could be that we demand analyticity when time
is chosen to be complex, and boundedness of the wave functions in the lower half of the
complex time frame. This would exclude the negative energy states, and still allow us
to represent all probability distributions with wave functions. Equivalently, one could
consider complex values for the variable(s) ⃗q and demand the absence of singularities in
the complex plane below the real axis. Such analyticity constraints however seem to be
rather arbitrary; they are diﬃcult to maintain as soon as interactions are introduced, so
they would certainly have to be handled with caution.
One very promising approach to solve the ground state problem is Dirac’s great idea
of second quantisation: take an indeﬁnite number of objects ⃗q , that is, a Hilbert space
spanned by all states |⃗q (1), ⃗q (2), · · · ⃗q (n)⟩, for all particle numbers n , and regard the
negative energy conﬁgurations as ‘holes’ of antiparticles. This we propose to do in our
‘neutrino model’, section 15.2, and in later chapters.
Alternatively, we might consider the continuum limit of a discrete theory more care-
fully. This we try ﬁrst in the next chapter. Let us emphasise again: in general, excising
the negative energy states just like that is not always a good idea, because any pertur-
bation of the system might cause transitions to these negative energy states, and leaving
these transitions out may violate unitarity.
The importance of the ground state of the Hamiltonian was discussed in chapter 9 of
part I. The Hamiltonian (12.18) is an important expression for fundamental discussions
on quantum mechanics.
As in the discrete case, also in the case of deterministic models with a continuous
evolution law, one ﬁnds discrete and continuous eigenvalues, depending on whether or not
a system is periodic. In the limit δt →0 of the discrete periodic ontological model, the
eigenvalues are integer multiples of 2π/T , and this is also the spectrum of the harmonic
oscillator with period T , as explained in chapter 13. The harmonic oscillator may be
regarded as a deterministic system in disguise.
The more general continuous model is then the system obtained ﬁrst by having a
(ﬁnite or inﬁnite) number of harmonic oscillators, which means that our system consists
of many periodic substructures, and secondly by admitting a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) number
of conserved quantities on which the periods of the oscillators depend. An example is
116

the ﬁeld of non-interacting particles; quantum ﬁeld theory then corresponds to having
an inﬁnite number of oscillating modes of this ﬁeld. The particles may be fermionic or
bosonic; the fermionic case is also a set of oscillators if the fermions are put in a box with
periodic boundary conditions. Interacting quantum particles will be encountered later
(chapter 19 and onwards).
13.
The continuum limit of cogwheels, harmonic rotators and
oscillators
In the N →∞limit, a cogwheel will have an inﬁnite number of states. The Hamiltonian
will therefore also have inﬁnitely many eigenstates. We have seen that there are two ways
to take a continuum limit. As N →∞, we can keep the quantised time step ﬁxed,
say it is 1. Then, in the Hamiltonian (2.24), we have to allow the quantum number k
to increase proportionally to N , keeping κ = k/N ﬁxed. Since the time step is one,
the Hamiltonian eigenvalues, 2πκ , now lie on a circle, or, we can say that the energy
takes values in the continuous line segment [0, 2π) (including the point 0 but excluding
the point 2π ).
Again, one may add an arbitrary constant δE to this continuum of
eigenvalues. What we have then, is a model of an object moving on a lattice in one
direction. At the beat of a clock, a state moves one step at a time to the right. This is the
rack, introduced in section 12.2. The second-quantised version is handled in section 17.1.
The other option for a continuum limit is to keep the period T of the cogwheel
constant, while the time quantum δt tends to zero. This is also a cogwheel, now with
inﬁnitely many, microscopic teeth, but still circular. Since now N δt = T is ﬁxed, the
ontological31 states of the system can be described as an angle:
2πn/N →ϕ ,
d
dtϕ(t) = 2π
T .
(13.1)
The energy eigenvalues become
Ek = 2π k/T + δE ,
k = 0, 1, · · · , ∞.
(13.2)
If δE is chosen to be π/T , we have the spectrum Ek = (2π/T)(k + 1
2) . This is the
spectrum of a harmonic oscillator.
In fact, any periodic system with period T , and
a continuous time variable can be characterised by deﬁning an angle ϕ obeying the
evolution equation (13.1), and we can attempt to apply a mapping onto a harmonic
oscillator with the same period.
Mappings of one model onto another one will be frequently considered in this book.
It will be of importance to understand what we mean by this. If one does not put any
constraint on the nature of the mapping, one would be able to map any model onto any
other model; physically this might then be rather meaningless. Generally, what we are
looking for are mappings that can be prescribed in a time-independent manner. This
31The words ‘ontological’ and ‘deterministic’ will be frequently used to indicate the same thing: a
model without any non deterministic features, describing things that are really there.
117

means that, once we know how to solve the evolution law for one model, then after
applying the mapping, we have also solved the evolution equations of the other model.
The physical data of one model will reveal to us how the physical data of the other one
evolve.
This requirement might not completely suﬃce in case a model is exactly integrable. In
that case, every integrable model can be mapped onto any other one, just by considering
the exact solutions. In practice, however, time independence of the prescription can be
easily veriﬁed, and if we now also require that the mapping of the physical data of one
model onto those of the other is one-to-one, we can be conﬁdent that we have a relation
of the kind we are looking for. If now a deterministic model is mapped onto a quantum
model, we may demand that the classical states of the deterministic model map onto
an orthonormal basis of the quantum model. Superpositions, which look natural in the
quantum system, might look somewhat contrived and meaningless in the deterministic
system, but they are certainly acceptable as describing probabilistic distributions in the
latter. This book is about these mappings.
We have already seen how a periodic deterministic system can produce a discrete spec-
trum of energy eigenstates. The continuous system described in this subsection generates
energy eigenstates that are equally spaced, and range from a lowest state to E →∞.
Mapping this onto the harmonic oscillator, seems to be straightforward; all we have to
do is map these energy eigenstates onto those of the oscillator, and since these are also
equally spaced, both systems will evolve in the same way. Of course this is nothing to be
surprised about: both systems are integrable and periodic with the same period T .
For the rest of this subsection, we will put T = 2π . The Hamiltonian of this harmonic
oscillator can then be chosen to be32
Hop = 1
2(p2 + x2 −1) ;
Hop |n⟩H = n |n⟩H ,
n = 0, 1, · · · , ∞.
(13.3)
The subscript
H reminds us that we are looking at the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian
Hop . For later convenience, we subtracted the zero point energy33.
In previous versions of this book’s manuscript, we described a mapping that goes
directly from a deterministic (but continuous) periodic system onto a harmonic oscillator.
Some diﬃculties were encountered with unitarity of the mapping. At ﬁrst sight, these
diﬃculties seemed not to be very serious, although they made the exposition less than
transparent. It turned out, however, that having a lower bound but not an upper bound
on the energy spectrum does lead to pathologies that we wish to avoid.
It is much better to do the mapping in two steps: have as an intermediate model the
harmonic rotator, as was introduced in chapter 12.1. The harmonic rotator diﬀers from
the harmonic oscillator by having not only a ground state, but also a ceiling. This makes
it symmetric under sign switches of the Hamiltonian. The lower energy domain of the
32In these expressions, x, p, a , and a† are all operators, but we omitted the subscript “op” to keep
the expressions readable.
33Interestingly, this zero point energy would have the eﬀect of ﬂipping the sign of the amplitudes after
exactly one period. Of course, this phase factor is not directly observable, but it may play some role in
future considerations. In what we do now, it is better to avoid these complications.
118

rotator maps perfectly onto the harmonic oscillator, while the transition from the rotator
to the continuous periodic system is a straightforward limiting procedure.
Therefore, let us ﬁrst identify the operators x and p of the harmonic rotator, with
operators in the space of the ontological states |ϕ⟩ont of our periodic system. This is
straightforward, see Eqs. (12.3). In the energy basis of the rotator, we have the lowering
operator L−and the raising operator L+ which give to the operators x and p the
following matrix elements between eigenstates |m⟩, −ℓ≤m ≤ℓ, of Hop :
⟨m −1|x|m⟩=

(13.4)
while all other matrix elements vanish.
13.1.
The operator ϕop in the harmonic rotator
As long as the harmonic rotator has ﬁnite ℓ, the operator ϕop is to be replaced by a
discrete one:
ϕop =
2π
2ℓ+ 1σ ,
σ = −ℓ, −ℓ+ 1 , · · · , +ℓ.
(13.5)
By discrete Fourier transformations, one derives that the discrete function ϕ(σ) obeys
the ﬁnite Fourier expansion,
σ = i

(13.6)
By modifying some phase factors, we replace the relations (2.21) and (2.22) by
|m⟩H

(which symmetrizes the Hamiltonian eigenvalues m , now ranging from −ℓto ℓ).
One now sees that the operator e

2ℓ+1σ increases the value m by one unit, with the
exception of the state |m = ℓ⟩, which goes to |m = −ℓ⟩. Therefore,

and Eq. (13.6) can now be written as

 ,
k ̸= 0 ,
⟨m|σ|m⟩

(13.10)
Eqs (13.9) can easily be seen to be unitary expressions, for all ℓin the harmonic rotator.
Care was taken to represent the square roots in the deﬁnitions of L± correctly: since
now |H| ≤ℓ, one never encounters division by 0. The quantity m + k characterising
the state in Eq. (13.10) must be read Modulo 2ℓ+ 1 , while observing the fact that for
half-odd-integer values of ℓthe relations (13.7) and (13.8) are both anti periodic with
period 2ℓ+ 1 .
The operator σ in Eqs (13.9) and (13.10) can now be seen to evolve deterministically:
σ(t) = σ(0) + (2ℓ+ 1) t/T .
(13.11)
The eigenstates |ϕ⟩of the operator ϕop are closely related to Glauber’s coherent
states in the harmonic oscillator [17], but our operator ϕop is hermitean and its eigen-
states are orthonormal; Glauber’s states are eigenstates of the creation or annihilation
operators, which were introduced by him following a diﬀerent philosophy. Orthonormal-
ity is a prerequisite for the ontological states that are used in this work.
13.2.
The harmonic rotator in the x frame
In harmonic oscillators, it is quite illuminating to see how the equations look in the
coordinate frame. The energy eigen states are the Hermite functions. It is an interesting
exercise in mathematical physics to investigate how the ontological operator (beable) ϕop
can be constructed as a matrix in x -space. As was explained at the beginning of this
chapter however, we refrain from exhibiting this calculation as it might lead to confusion.
The operator ϕop is represented by the integer σ in Eq. (13.5). This operator is
transformed to the energy basis by Eqs. (13.7) and (13.8), taking the form (13.9). In
order to transform these into x space, we ﬁrst need the eigen states of Lx in the energy
basis. This is a unitary transformation requiring the matrix elements ⟨m3|m1⟩, where
m3 are the eigen values of L3 and m1 those of Lx . Using the ladder operators L± , one
ﬁnds the useful recursion relation
2m1⟨m1|m3⟩
=
p
(ℓ+ m3 + 1)(ℓ−m3) ⟨m1|m3 + 1⟩+
p
(ℓ+ m3)(ℓ+ 1 −m3) ⟨m1|m3 −1⟩,
(13.12)
First remove the square roots by deﬁning new states ||m3⟩and ||m1⟩:
||m3⟩
≡
p
(ℓ+ m3)! (ℓ−m3)! |m3⟩,
||m1⟩
≡
p
(ℓ+ m1)! (ℓ−m1)! |m1⟩.
(13.13)
120

For them, we have
L± ||m3⟩= (ℓ∓m3) ||m3⟩,
(13.14)
so that the inner products of these new states obey
2m1⟨m1|||m3⟩
=
(ℓ−m3) ⟨m1|||m3 + 1⟩+ (ℓ+ m3) ⟨m1|||m3⟩;
⟨m1|||m3⟩
=
⟨m3|||m1⟩.

Figure 9: a) Plot of the inner products ⟨m3|m1⟩; b) Plot of the transformation
matrix ⟨m1|σ⟩ont (real part). Horiz.: m1 , vert.: σ .
These equations can easily be inserted in a numerical procedure to determine the
matrix elements of the transformation to the ‘coordinate frame’ Lx . With Eqs. (13.7)
and (13.8), we now ﬁnd the elements ⟨m1|σ⟩of the matrix relating the beable eigen states
|σ⟩ont to the x eigen states of Lx . A graphic expression of the result (for ℓ= 40 ), is
displayed in Fig. 9. We see in Fig. 9b that the ontological variable is loosely following
the template degree of freedom x = m1/
√
ℓ, just as it will follow the momentum p =
−m2/
√
ℓ, with a 90◦phase shift.
14.
Locality
Replacing harmonic oscillators by harmonic rotators may be the ﬁrst step towards obtain-
ing a Hamiltonian that describes deterministic processes on the one hand, and still obeys
a lower bound on the other hand. Yet we did pay a price. We modiﬁed the commutation
121

rules between the coordinate operators called x and the momentum operators p . If we
would apply this to ﬁeld theories, we would ﬁnd it diﬃcult to decompose the ﬁelds into
harmonic modes. These modes would no longer commute with one another, and that
would constitute a serious blow to the concept of locality.
We have also seen how a Hamiltonian can be constructed starting oﬀfrom just any
deterministic system, including systems that are entirely local in the usual sense. If time
is continuous, that Hamiltonian tends to take the form of Eq, (12.18), which has neither a
lower nor an upper bound, but it does seem to be local. In contrast, the Hamiltonians of
the discrete-time models, such as Eqs. (2.8), (2.26), (2.27), and (12.10), have in common
that they are bounded, but they are expressed in terms of the evolution operators at
fairly large times t = nδt .
For cellular automaton models, discussed in section 5.1
and chapter 21, the evolution operator over n time steps, involves interactions among
neighbours that are n space-steps apart. If, instead, we wish to restrict ourselves to local
expressions, this means that a cut-oﬀwill have to be introduced when deﬁning H , but
this is only allowed if the sums in question converge suﬃciently rapidly. It seems to be
the combination of the positivity requirement and the locality requirement that is often
diﬃcult to obey.
Can this conﬂict be avoided? Should we search for diﬀerent models, or should we
search for diﬀerent approximation methods in all models we are using? The author’s
present understanding is, that we will have to put constraints on the models to which we
can apply our theories. Diﬀerent models will be discussed later (section 9.2). Let us here
concentrate on the nature of the conﬂict.
In part I, section 2.1, we introduced the concept of the templates. Let us see what
happens when we impose a further constraint on the templates: Consider only those
template states that are slowly varying in time. We assume that the time dependence in
the templates is much slower than the fundamental time interval δt in the ontological
evolution law. This means that we consider only those elements of Hilbert space where
the eigenvalue E of H lies in an interval |E| ≤1
2Λ , or, when we add our free constant
to the energy levels, we impose
0 ≤E ≤Λ .
(14.1)
States composed as superpositions of these energy eigenvalues will show probabilities
|⟨ont|ψ(t)⟩|2 whose time dependence only contains terms eiωt with |ω| ≤Λ . Templates
obeying Ineq. (14.1) will be referred to as slow templates.
It is advised, however, to be reserved in the use of slow templates; in classical states,
energies can easily reach values above the Planck energy (the kinetic energy of a small
passenger airplane at cruise speed), and these would require faster templates.
Figure 10 a shows the approximation obtained for the Hamiltonian, in the case we use
the expansion (2.8), with a smooth cut-oﬀ. We introduced a suppression factor e−k/R for
the kth term (in the Figure, R = 30 ). What happens when we use this approximation
for the Hamiltonian?
First, it is not quite local anymore. In a cellular automaton, where we have only
nearest neighbour interactions, the Hamiltonian will feature ‘ghost interactions’ between

neighbours at k units of distance apart, assuming that the kth term contains the evolution
operator U(±kδt) . With the suppression factor, we expect the Hamiltonian to have non-
local features over distance scales of the order of Rδt c , where c is the maximal velocity of
information transfer in the automaton, since the exponential suppression factor strongly
suppresses eﬀects ranging further out.
On the other hand, if we use the suppression factor, the lowest energy states in the
spectrum will be altered, see the arrow in Fig. 10 a . Unfortunately, this is exactly the
123

physically most important region, near the vacuum state (the lowest energy state). It is
not diﬃcult to estimate the extent of the deformation close to the origin. The sum with
cut-oﬀcan be evaluated exactly. For large values of the cut-oﬀR , and 0 < ω < π , the
approximation ωapprox for the true eigenvalues ω of the Hamiltonian will be:

where we replaced e1/R by 1 + 1/R since R is large and arbitrary.
Writing
sin α
1+cos α = tan 1
2α , we see that the approximation becomes exact in the limit
R →∞. We are interested in the states close to the vacuum, having a small but positive
energy H = α . Then, at ﬁnite R , the cut-oﬀat R replaces the eigenvalues H of the
Hamiltonian Hop by
H →H +
2
R H ,
(14.3)
which has its minimum at H0 ≈
p
2/R , where the value of the minimum is H ≈2
p
2/R .
This is only acceptable if
R ≫MPl/⟨Hop⟩2 .
(14.4)
Here, MPl is the “Planck mass”, or whatever the inverse is of the elementary time scale
in the model. This cut-oﬀradius R must therefore be chosen to be very large, so that,
indeed, the exact quantum description of our local model generates non-locality in the
Hamiltonian.
Thus, if we want a Hamiltonian that represents the behaviour near the vacuum cor-
rectly, so that time scales of the order T are described correctly, the Hamiltonian gener-
ated by the model will be non-local over much larger distances, of the order of T 2MPl .
Apparently, a deterministic automaton does generate quantum behaviour, but the quan-
tum Hamiltonian features spurious non-local interactions.
It is not diﬃcult to observe that the conﬂict between locality and positivity that we
came across is caused by the fact that the spectrum of the energy had to be chosen such
that a θ jump occurs at ω = 0 , exactly where we have the vacuum state (see Fig. 10 a ).
The Fourier coeﬃcients of a function with a θ function jump will always converge only
very slowly, and the sharper we want this discontinuity to be reproduced by our Hamil-
tonian, the more Fourier coeﬃcients are needed. Indeed, the induced non-locality will
be much greater than the size of the system we might want to study. Now, we stress
that this non-locality is only apparent; the physics of the automaton itself is quite local,
since only directly neighbouring cells inﬂuence one another. Yet the quantum mechanics
obtained does not resemble what we see in the physical world, where the Hamiltonian
can be seen as an integral over a Hamilton density H(⃗x) , where [H(⃗x), H(⃗x ′] = 0 as
soon as |⃗x −⃗x ′| > ε > 0 . In standard quantum ﬁeld theories, this ε tends to zero. If
124

it stretches over millions of CA cells this would still be acceptable if that distance is not
yet detectable in modern experiments, but what we just saw was unacceptable. Clearly,
a better strategy has to be found.
Our best guess at present for resolving this diﬃculty is second quantisation, which was
introduced in section 9.2, and we return to it in sections 20.3 and 22.1. Here, we just
mention that second quantisation will allow us to have the most important physics take
place in the central region of this spectrum, rather than at the edges, see the arrow in
Fig. 10 b . In this region, our eﬀective Hamiltonians can be made to be very accurate,
while still local. Suppose we expand the Hamiltonian in terms of Fourier coeﬃcients that
behave as
(sin ω)n = (i/2)n
U(δt) −U(−δt)
n
,
(14.5)
with a limit on the power n . For small ω , the most accurate approximation may seem
to be
ω =
(R−1)/2

(14.6)
where an = 1,
1
6,

112, . . . are the coeﬃcients of the expansion of arcsin(z) in powers
of z . If we continue that to the power R , we get a very rapidly converging expression
for the energy near the center of the spectrum, where ω is small. If we use that part of
the spectrum, the error in the Hamiltonian will be of order (ωδt)R+2 , so that only a few
neighbours suﬃce to give a suﬃciently accurate Hamiltonian.
However, Fig. 10 b is still not quite what we want. For all states that have ω near
±π , the energies are also low, while these are not the states that should be included,
in particular when perturbations are added for generating interactions. To remove those
states, we desire Fourier expansions that generate the curves of Fig 10 d . Here, the states
with ω ≈π still contribute, which is inevitable because, indeed, we cannot avoid a θ
jump there, but since the lines are now much steeper at that spot, the states at ω = ±π
may safely be neglected; the best expression we can generate will have a density of the
spurious states that drops as 1/
√
R times the density of the allowed states. How does
one generate these Fourier expansions?
To show how that is done, we return the Fig 10 b , and notice that diﬀerentiating it
with respect to ω gives us the Fourier expansion of a θ function. Multiplying that with
the original should give us the functions of Fig. 10 c . The easiest way to see what happens
is to observe that we multiply the limit curve (the zigzag line in 10 b ) with cos ω/| cos ω| ,
where the denominator is expanded in powers of sin ω . Then, we are given the functions
H(ω) = cos ω

Finally, because Fig. 10 c is periodic with period π , we can stretch it by multiplying
ω by 2. This gives Fig. 10 d , where the limit curve is approximated by

(14.9)
with the same coeﬃcients bk . Thus, it is now this equation that we use to determine the
operator H from the one-time-step evolution operator U = U(δt) . Using U to denote
the inverse, U = U(−δt) = U −1 , we substitute in Eq. (14.9):
sin ω = i
2(U −U) ,
(1 −cos ω)/2 = 1
4(2 −U −U) .
(14.10)
The trick we can then apply is to consider the negative energy states as representing
antiparticles, after we apply second quantisation. This very important step, which we
shall primarily apply to fermions, is introduced in the next section, while interactions are
postponed to section 22.1.
15.
Fermions
15.1.
The Jordan-Wigner transformation
In order to ﬁnd more precise links between the real quantum world on the one hand
and deterministic automaton models on the other, much more mathematical machinery
is needed. For starters, fermions can be handled in an elegant fashion.
Take a deterministic model with M states in total. The example described in Fig. 2
(page 27), is a model with M = 31 states, and the evolution law for one time step is an
element P of the permutation group for M = 31 elements: P ∈PM . Let its states be
indicated as |1⟩, · · · , |M⟩. We write the single time step evolution law as:
|i⟩t →|i⟩t+δt = |P(i)⟩t =
M
X
j=1
Pij|j⟩t ,
i = 1, · · · , M ,
(15.1)
where the latter matrix P has matrix elements ⟨j|P|i⟩that consists of 0s and 1s, with
one 1 only in each row and in each column. As explained in section 2.2.2, we assume that
a Hamiltonian matrix Hop
ij is found such that (when normalising the time step δt to one)
⟨j|P|i⟩= (e−iHop )ji ,
(15.2)
where possibly a zero point energy δE may be added that represents a conserved quantity:
δE only depends on the cycle to which the index i belongs, but not on the item inside
the cycle.
We now associate to this model a diﬀerent one, whose variables are Boolean ones,
taking the values 0 or 1 (or equivalently, +1 or −1 ) at every one of these M sites. This
126

Black dots represent fermions.
means that, in our example, we now have 2M = 2,147,483,648 states, one of which is
shown in Fig. 11. The evolution law is deﬁned such that these Boolean numbers travel
just as the sites in the original cogwheel model were dictated to move. Physically this
means that, if in the original model, exactly one particle was moving as dictated, we now
have N particles moving, where N can vary between 0 and M . In particle physics, this
is known as “second quantisation”. Since no two particles are allowed to sit at the same
site, we have fermions, obeying Pauli’s exclusion principle.
To describe these deterministic fermions in a quantum mechanical notation, we ﬁrst
introduce operator ﬁelds φop
i , acting as annihilation operators, and their hermitean conju-
gates, φop †
i
, which act as creation operators. Denoting our states now as |n1, n2, · · · , nM⟩,
where all n ’s are 0 or 1, we postulate
φop
i |n1, · · · , ni, · · · , nM⟩
=
ni |n1, · · · , ni −1, · · · , nM⟩,
φop †
i
|n1, · · · , ni, · · · , nM⟩
=
(1 −ni) |n1, · · · , ni + 1, · · · , nM⟩,
(15.3)
At one given site i , these ﬁelds obey (omitting the superscript ‘op’ for brevity):
(φi)2 = 0,
φ†
iφi + φi φ†
i = I ,
(15.4)
where I is the identity operator; at diﬀerent sites, the ﬁelds commute: φi φj = φj φi ;
φ†
iφj = φjφ†
i , if i ̸= j .
To turn these into completely anti-commuting (fermionic) ﬁelds, we apply the so-called
Jordan-Wigner transformation [4]:
ψi = (−1)n1+···+ni−1φi ,
(15.5)
where ni = φ†
iφi = ψ†
i ψi are the occupation numbers at the sites i , i.e., we insert a
minus sign if an odd number of sites j with j < i are occupied. As a consequence of
this well-known procedure, one now has
ψi ψj + ψj ψi = 0 ,

The virtue of this transformation is that the anti-commutation relations (15.6) stay
unchanged after any linear, unitary transformation of the ψi as vectors in our M -
dimensional vector space, provided that ψ†
i transform as contra-vectors. Usually, the
minus signs in Eq. (15.5) do no harm, but some care is asked for.
Now consider the permutation matrix P and write the Hamiltonian in Eq. (15.2) as
a lower case hij ; it is an M ×M component matrix. Writing Uij(t) = (e−iht)ij , we have,
at integer time steps, P t
op = U op(t) . We now claim that the permutation that moves the
fermions around, is generated by the Hamiltonian Hop

deﬁned as

(15.11)
where the anti-commutator is deﬁned as {A, B} ≡AB +BA (note that the second term
in Eq. (15.10) vanishes).
This is the same equation that describes the evolution of the states |k⟩of the original
cogwheel model. So we see that, at integer time steps t , the ﬁelds ψi(t) are permuted
according to the permutation operator P t . Note now, that the empty state |0⟩(which
is not the vacuum state) does not evolve at all (and neither does the completely ﬁlled
state). The N particle state ( 0 ≤N ≤M ), obtained by applying N copies of the ﬁeld
operators ψ†
i , therefore evolves with the same permutator. The Jordan Wigner minus
sign, (15.5), gives the transformed state a minus sign if after t permutations the order
of the N particles has become an odd permutation of their original relative positions.
Although we have to be aware of the existence of this minus sign, it plays no signiﬁcant
role in most cases. Physically, this sign is not observable.
The importance of the procedure displayed here is that we can read oﬀhow anti-
commuting fermionic ﬁeld operators ψi , or ψi(x) , can emerge from deterministic systems.
The minus signs in their (anti-)commutators is due to the Jordan-Wigner transformation
(15.5), without which we would not have any commutator expressions at all, so that the
derivation (15.11) would have failed.
128

The ﬁnal step in this second quantisation procedure is that we now use our freedom
to perform orthogonal transformations among the ﬁelds ψ and ψ† , such that we expand
them in terms of the eigenstates ψ(Ei) of the one-particle Hamiltonian hij . Then the
state |∅⟩obeying
ψ(Ei)|∅⟩= 0 if Ei > 0 ;
ψ†(Ei)|∅⟩= 0 if Ei < 0 ,
(15.12)
has the lowest energy of all. Now, that is the vacuum state, as Dirac proposed. The
negative energy states are interpreted as holes for antiparticles.
The operators ψ(E)
annihilate particles if E > 0 or create antiparticles if E < 0 .
For ψ†(E) it is the
other way around. Particles and antiparticles now all carry positive energy. Is this then
the resolution of the problem noted in chapter 14?
This depends on how we handle
interactions, see chapter 9.2 in part I, and we discuss this important question further in
section 22.1 and in chapter 23.
The conclusion of this section is that, if the Hamiltonian matrix hij describes a
single or composite cogwheel model, leading to classical permutations of the states |i⟩,
i = 1, · · · , M , at integer times, then the model with Hamiltonian (15.7) is related to a
system where occupied states evolve according to the same permutations, the diﬀerence
being that now the total number of states is 2M instead of M . And the energy is always
bounded from below.
One might object that in most physical systems the Hamiltonian matrix hij would
not lead to classical permutations at integer time steps, but our model is just a ﬁrst step.
A next step could be that hij is made to depend on the values of some local operator
ﬁelds ϕ(x) .
This is what we have in the physical world, and this may result if the
permutation rules for the evolution of these fermionic particles are assumed to depend on
other variables in the system.
In fact, there does exist a fairly realistic, simpliﬁed fermionic model where hij does
appear to generate pure permutations. This will be exhibited in the next section.
A procedure for bosons should go in analogous ways, if one deals with bosonic ﬁelds in
quantum ﬁeld theory. However, a relation with deterministic theories is not as straight-
forward as in the fermionic case, because arbitrarily large numbers of bosonic particles
may occupy a single site. To mitigate this situation, the notion of harmonic rotators was
introduced, which also for bosons only allows ﬁnite numbers of states. We can apply
more conventional bosonic second quantisation in some special two-dimensional theories,
see subsection 17.1.1.
How second quantisation is applied in standard quantum ﬁeld theories is described in
section 20.3.
15.2.
‘Neutrinos’ in three space dimensions
In some cases, it is worth-while to start at the other end. Given a typical quantum system,
can one devise a deterministic classical automaton that would generate all its quantum
states? We now show a new case of interest.
129

One way to determine whether a quantum system may be mathematically equivalent
to a deterministic model is to search for a complete set of beables. As deﬁned in subsec-
tion 2.1.1, beables are operators that may describe classical observables, and as such they
must commute with one another, always, at all times. Thus, for conventional quantum
particles such as the electron in Bohr’s hydrogen model, neither the operators x nor p
are beables because [ x(t) , x(t′) ] ̸= 0 and [ p(t), p(t′) ] ̸= 0 as soon as t ̸= t′ . Typical
models where we do have such beables are ones where the Hamiltonian is linear in the
momenta, such as in section 12.3, Eq. (12.18), rather than quadratic in p . But are they
the only ones?
Maybe the beables only form a space-time grid, whereas the data on points in between
the points on the grid do not commute. This would actually serve our purpose well, since
it could be that the physical data characterising our universe really do form such a grid,
while we have not yet been able to observe that, just because the grid is too ﬁne for today’s
tools, and interpolations to include points in between the grid points could merely have
been consequences of our ignorance.
Beables form a complete set if, in the basis where they are all diagonal, the collection
of eigenvalues completely identify the elements of this basis.
No such systems of beables do occur in nature, as far as we know today; that is, if
we take all known forces into account, all operators that we can construct today cease
to commute at some point. We can, and should, try to search better, but, alternatively,
we can produce simpliﬁed models describing only parts of what we see, which do allow
transformations to a basis of beables. In chapter 12.1, we already discussed the harmonic
rotator as an important example, which allowed for some interesting mathematics in
chapter 13. Eventually, its large N limit should reproduce the conventional harmonic
oscillator. Here, we discuss another such model: massless ‘neutrinos’, in 3 space-like and
one time-like dimension.
A single quantised, non interacting Dirac fermion obeys the Hamiltonian34
Hop = αipi + βm ,
(15.13)
where αi, β are Dirac 4 × 4 matrices obeying
αiαj + αjαi = 2δij ;
β2 = 1 ;
αi β + β αi = 0 .
(15.14)
Only in the case m = 0 can we construct a complete set of beables, in a straightforward
manner35. In that case, we can omit the matrix β , and replace αi by the three Pauli
matrices, the 2 × 2 matrices σi . The particle can then be looked upon as a massless
(Majorana or chiral) “neutrino”, having only two components in its spinor wave function.
The neutrino is entirely ‘sterile’, as we ignore any of its interactions. This is why we call
this the ‘neutrino’ model, with ‘neutrino’ between quotation marks.
34Summation convention: repeated indices are usually summed over.
35Massive ‘neutrinos’ could be looked upon as massless ones in a space with one or more extra dimen-
sions, and that does also have a beable basis. Projecting this set back to 4 space-time dimensions however
leads to a rather contrived construction.
130

There are actually two choices here: the relative signs of the Pauli matrices could be
chosen such that the particles have positive (left handed) helicity and the antiparticles are
right handed, or they could be the other way around. We take the choice that particles
have the right handed helicities, if our coordinate frame (x, y, z) is oriented as the ﬁngers
1,2,3 of the right hand. The Pauli matrices σi obey
σ1 σ2 = iσ3 ,
σ2 σ3 = iσ1 ,
σ3 σ1 = iσ2 ;
σ2
1 = σ2
2 = σ2
3 = 1 .
(15.15)
The beables are:
{Oop
i } = { ˆq, s, r} ,
where
ˆqi ≡±pi/|p| ,
s ≡ˆq · ⃗σ ,
r ≡1
2(ˆq · ⃗x + ⃗x · ˆq) .
(15.16)
To be precise, ˆq is a unit vector deﬁning the direction of the momentum, modulo its sign.
What this means is that we write the momentum ⃗p as
⃗p = pr ˆq ,
(15.17)
where pr can be a positive or negative real number. This is important, because we need
its canonical commutation relation with the variable r , being [ r, pr ] = i , without further
restrictions on r or pr . If pr would be limited to the positive numbers |p| , this would
imply analyticity constraints for wave functions ψ(r) .
The caret ˆ on the operator ˆq is there to remind us that it is a vector with length one,
|ˆq| = 1 . To deﬁne its sign, one could use a condition such as ˆqz > 0 . Alternatively, we
may decide to keep the symmetry Pint (for ‘internal parity’),
ˆq ↔−ˆq ,
pr ↔−pr ,
r ↔−r ,
s ↔−s ,
(15.18)
after which we would keep only the wave functions that are even under this reﬂection.
The variable s can only take the values s = ±1 , as one can check by taking the square
of ˆq · ⃗σ . In the sequel, the symbol ˆp will be reserved for ˆp = +⃗p/|p| , so that ˆq = ±ˆp .
The last operator in Eq. (15.16), the operator r , was symmetrised so as to guarantee
that it is hermitean. It can be simpliﬁed by using the following observations. In the ⃗p
basis, we have
⃗x = i ∂
∂⃗p ;
∂
∂⃗p pr = ˆq ;
[ xi, pr ] = iˆqi ;
[ xi, ˆqj ] = i
pr
(δij −ˆqiˆqj) ;
(15.19)
xiˆqi −ˆqixi = 2i
pr
→
1
2(ˆq · ⃗x + ⃗x · ˆq) = ˆq · ⃗x + i
pr
.
(15.20)
This can best be checked ﬁrst by checking the case pr = |p| > 0, ˆq = ˆp , and noting that
all equations are preserved under the reﬂection symmetry (15.18).
It is easy to check that the operators (15.16) indeed form a completely commuting set.
The only non-trivial commutator to be looked at carefully is [r, ˆq] = [ ˆq · ⃗x , ˆq ] . Consider
131

again the ⃗p basis, where ⃗x = i∂/∂⃗p : the operator ⃗p · ∂/∂⃗p is the dilatation operator.
But, since ˆq is scale invariant, it commutes with the dilatation operator:
[ ⃗p · ∂
∂⃗p , ˆq ] = 0 .
(15.21)
Therefore,
[ ˆq · ⃗x, ˆq ] = i [ p−1
r ⃗p · ∂
∂⃗p , ˆq ] = 0 ,
(15.22)
since also [ pr, ˆq ] = 0 , but of course we could also have used equation (15.19), # 4.
The unit vector ˆq lives on a sphere, characterised by two angles θ and ϕ . If we
decide to deﬁne ˆq such that qz > 0 then the domains in which these angles must lie are:
0 ≤θ ≤π/2 ,
0 ≤ϕ < 2π .
(15.23)
The other variables take the values
s = ±1 ,
−∞< r < ∞.
(15.24)
An important question concerns the completeness of these beables and their relation
to the more usual operates ⃗x, ⃗p and ⃗σ , which of course do not commute so that these
themselves are no beables. This we discuss in the next subsection, which can be skipped at
ﬁrst reading. For now, we mention the more fundamental observation that these beables
can describe ontological observables at all times, since the Hamiltonian (15.13), which
here reduces to
H = ⃗σ · ⃗p ,
(15.25)
generates the equations of motion
d
dt⃗x = −i[⃗x, H] = ⃗σ ,
d
dt⃗p = 0 ,
d
dtσi = 2εijk pj σk ;
(15.26)
d
dt ˆp = 0 ;
d
dt(ˆp · ⃗σ) = 2εijk (pi/|p|) pjσk = 0 ,
d
dt(ˆp · ⃗x) = ˆp · ⃗σ ,
(15.27)
where ˆp = ⃗p/|p| = ±ˆq , and thus we have:
d
dtθ = 0 ,
d
dtϕ = 0 ,
d
dts = 0 ,
d
dtr = s = ± 1 .
(15.28)
The physical interpretation is simple: the variable r is the position of a ‘particle’
projected along a predetermined direction ˆq , given by the two angles θ and ϕ , and the
sign of s determines whether it moves with the speed of light towards larger or towards
smaller r values.
132

Note, that a rotation over 180◦along an axis orthogonal to ˆq may turn s into −s ,
which is characteristic for half-odd spin representations of the rotation group, so that we
can still consider the neutrino as a spin
1
2 particle.36
What we have here is a representation of the wave function for a single ‘neutrino’ in
an unusual basis. As will be clear from the calculations presented in the subsection below,
in this basis the ‘neutrino’ is entirely non localised in the two transverse directions, but
its direction of motion is entirely ﬁxed by the unit vector ˆq and the Boolean variable s .
In terms of this basis, the ‘neutrino’ is a deterministic object. Rather than saying that
we have a particle here, we have a ﬂat sheet, a plane. The unit vector ˆq describes the
orientation of the plane, and the variable s tells us in which of the two possible directions
the plane moves, always with the speed of light. Neutrinos are deterministic planes, or
ﬂat sheets. The basis in which the operators ˆq, r , and s are diagonal will serve as an
ontological basis.
Finally, we could use the Boolean variable s to deﬁne the sign of ˆq , so that it becomes
a more familiar unit vector, but this can better be done after we studied the operators
that ﬂip the sign of the variable s , because of a slight complication, which is discussed
when we work out the algebra, in subsections 15.2.1 and 15.2.2.
Clearly, operators that ﬂip the sign of s exist. For that, we take any vector ˆq ′ that
is orthogonal to ˆq . Then, the operator ˆq ′ · ⃗σ obeys (ˆq ′ · ⃗σ) s = −s (ˆq ′ · ⃗σ) , as one
can easily check. So, this operator ﬂips the sign. The problem is that, at each point on
the sphere of ˆq values, one can take any unit length superposition of two such vectors
ˆq ′ orthogonal to ˆq . Which one should we take? Whatever our choice, it depends on
the angles θ and ϕ . This implies that we necessarily introduce some rather unpleasant
angular dependence. This is inevitable; it is caused by the fact that the original neutrino
had spin
1
2 , and we cannot mimic this behaviour in terms of the ˆq dependence because
all wave functions have integral spin. One has to keep this in mind whenever the Pauli
matrices are processed in our descriptions.
Thus, in order to complete our operator algebra in the basis determined by the eigen-
values ˆq, s, and r , we introduce two new operators whose squares ore one. Deﬁne two
vectors orthogonal to ˆq , one in the θ -direction and one in the ϕ -direction:
ˆq =


q1
q2
q3

,
ˆθ =
1
p

ˆϕ =



(15.29)
All three are normalised to one, as indicated by the caret. Their components obey
qi = εijk θjϕk ,
θi = εijk ϕjqk ,
ϕi = εijk qjθk .
(15.30)
Then we deﬁne two sign-ﬂip operators: write s = s3 , then
s1 = ˆθ · ⃗σ ,
s2 = ˆϕ · ⃗σ ,
s3 = s = ˆq · ⃗σ .
(15.31)
36But rotations in the plane, or equivalently, around the axis ˆq , give rise to complications, which can
be overcome, see later in this section.

the origin of 3-space.
They obey:
s2
i = I ,
s1 s2 = is3 ,
s2 s3 = is1 ,
s3 s1 = is2 .
(15.32)
Considering now the beable operators ˆq, r, and s3 , the translation operator pr for the
variable r , the spin ﬂip operators (“changeables”) s1 and s2 , and the rotation operators
for the unit vector ˆq , how do we transform back to the conventional neutrino operators
⃗x , ⃗p and ⃗σ ?
Obtaining the momentum operators is straightforward:
pi = pr ˆqi ,
(15.33)
and also the Pauli matrices σi can be expressed in terms of the si , simply by inverting
Eqs. (15.31). Using Eqs (15.29) and the fact that q2
1 +q2
2 +q2
3 = 1 , one easily veriﬁes that
σi = θis1 + ϕis2 + qis3 .
(15.34)
However, to obtain the operators xi is quite a bit more tricky; they must commute
with the σi . For this, we ﬁrst need the rotation operators ⃗Lont . This is not the standard
orbital or total angular momentum. Our transformation from standard variables to beable
134

variables will not be quite rotationally invariant, just because we will be using either the
operator s1 or the operator s2 to go from a left-moving neutrino to a right moving one.
Note, that in the standard picture, chiral neutrinos have spin
1
2 . So ﬂipping from one
mode to the opposite one involves one unit ℏof angular momentum in the plane. The
ontological basis does not refer to neutrino spin, and this is why our algebra gives some
spurious angular momentum violation. As long as neutrinos do not interact, this eﬀect
stays practically unnoticeable, but care is needed when either interactions or mass are
introduced.
The only rotation operators we can start oﬀwith in the beable frame, are the operators
that rotate the planes with respect to the origin of our coordinates. These we call ⃗Lont :
Lont
i
= −iεijkqj
∂
∂qk
.
(15.35)
By deﬁnition, they commute with the si , but care must be taken at the equator, where
we have a boundary condition, which can be best understood by imposing the symmetry
condition (15.18).
Note that the operators Lont
i
deﬁned in Eq. (15.35) do not coincide with any of the
conventional angular momentum operators because those do not commute with the si ,
as the latter depend on ˆθ and ˆϕ . One ﬁnds the following relation between the angular
momentum ⃗L of the neutrinos and ⃗L ont :

the derivation of this equation is postponed to subsection 15.2.1.

We then derive, in subsection 15.2.1, Eq. (15.60), the following expression for the

changeables37 Lont

The complete transformation from the beable basis to one of the conventional bases
for the neutrino can be derived from
⟨⃗p, α | ˆq, pr, s⟩= pr δ3(⃗p −ˆq pr)χs
α(ˆq) ,
(15.39)
37See Eq. (15.47) and the remarks made there concerning the deﬁnition of the operator 1/pr in the
world of the beables, as well as in the end of section 15.2.2.

χs
α is a standard spinor solution for the equation (ˆq · ⃗σαβ) χs
β(ˆq) = s χs
α(ˆq) .
In subsection 15.2.2, we show how this equation can be used to derive the elements of
the unitary transformation matrix mapping the beable basis to the standard coordinate
frame of the neutrino wave function basis38 (See Eq. 15.83):
⟨⃗x, α | ˆq, r, s ⟩= i

(15.40)
where δ ′(z) ≡

is necessary for a proper normalisation of the states.
15.2.1.
Algebra of the beable ‘neutrino’ operators
This subsection is fairly technical and can be skipped at ﬁrst reading. It derives the results
mentioned in the previous section, by handling the algebra needed for the transformations
from the (ˆq, s, r) basis to the (⃗x, σ3) or (⃗p, σ3) basis and back. This algebra is fairly
complex, again, because, in the beable representation, no direct reference is made to
neutrino spin. Chiral neutrinos are normally equipped with spin +1
2 or −1
2 with spin
axis in the direction of motion. The ﬂat planes that are moving along here, are invariant
under rotations about an orthogonal axis, and the associated spin-angular momentum
does not leave a trace in the non-interacting, beable picture.
This forces us to introduce some axis inside each plane that deﬁnes the phases of the
quantum states, and these (unobservable) phases explicitly break rotation invariance.
We consider the states speciﬁed by the variables s and r , and the polar coordinates
θ and ϕ of the beable ˆq , in the domains given by Eqs. (15.23), (15.24). Thus, we have
the states |θ, ϕ, s, r⟩. How can these be expressed in the more familiar states |⃗x, σz⟩
and/or |⃗p, σz⟩, where σz = ±1 describes the neutrino spin in the z -direction, and vice
versa?
Our ontological states are speciﬁed in the ontological basis spanned by the operators
ˆq, s (= s3), and r . We add the operators (changeables) s1 and s2 by specifying their
algebra (15.32), and the operator
pr = −i∂/∂r ;
[ r, pr] = i .
(15.41)
The original momentum operators are then easily retrieved. As in Eq, (15.17), deﬁne
⃗p = pr ˆq .
(15.42)
The next operators that we can reproduce from the beable operators ˆq, r , and s1,2,3
are the Pauli operators σ1,2,3 :
σi = θis1 + ϕis2 + qis3 .
(15.43)
38In this expression, there is no need to symmetrise ˆq ·⃗x , because both ˆq and ⃗x consist of C-numbers
only.
136

Note, that these now depend non-trivially on the angular parameters θ and ϕ , since the
vectors ˆθ and ˆϕ , deﬁned in Eq. (15.29), depend non-trivially on ˆq , which is the radial
vector speciﬁed by the angles θ and ϕ . One easily checks that the simple multiplication
rules from Eqs. (15.32) and the right-handed orthonormality (15.30) assure that these
Pauli matrices obey the correct multiplication rules also. Given the trivial commutation
rules for the beables, [qi, θj] = [qi, ϕj] = 0 , and [pr, qi] = 0 , one ﬁnds that [pi, σj] = 0 ,
so here, we have no new complications.
Things are far more complicated and delicate for the ⃗x operators. To reconstruct
an operator ⃗x = i∂/∂⃗p , obeying [xi, pj] = iδij and [xi, σj] = 0 , we ﬁrst introduce the
orbital angular momentum operator
Li = εijkxipk = −iεijkqj
∂
∂qk
(15.44)
(where σi are kept ﬁxed), obeying the usual commutation rules
[Li, Lj] = iεijkLk ,
[Li, qj] = iεijkqk ,
[Li, pj] = iεijkpk , etc.,
(15.45)
while [Li, σj] = 0 . Note, that these operators are not the same as the angular momenta
in the ontological frame, the Lont
i
of Eq. (15.35), since those are demanded to commute
with sj , while the orbital angular momenta Li commute with σj . In terms of the orbital
angular momenta (15.44), we can now recover the original space operators xi, i = 1, 2, 3 ,
of the neutrinos:
xi = qi (r −i
pr
) + εijk qj Lk/pr .
(15.46)
The operator 1/pr , the inverse of the operator pr = −i∂/∂r , should be −i times the
integration operator. This leaves the question of the integration constant. It is straight-
forward to deﬁne that in momentum space, but eventually, r is our beable operator.
For wave functions in r space, ψ(r, · · ·) = ⟨r, · · · |ψ⟩, where the ellipses stand for other
beables (of course commuting with r ), the most careful deﬁnition is:
1
pr
ψ(r) ≡
Z ∞
−∞
1
2i sgn(r −r′)ψ(r′)dr′ ,
(15.47)
which can easily be seen to return ψ(r) when pr acts on it. “sgn(x)” stands for the sign
of x . We do note that the integral must converge at r →±∞. This is a restriction
on the class of allowed wave functions: in momentum space, ψ must vanish at pr →0 .
Restrictions of this sort will be encountered more frequently in this book.
The anti hermitean term −i/pr in Eq. (15.46) arises automatically in a careful cal-
culation, and it just compensates the non hermiticity of the last term, where qj and Lk
should be symmetrised to get a hermitean expression. Lk commutes with pr . The xi
deﬁned here ends up being hermitean.
This perhaps did not look too hard, but we are not ready yet. The operators Li
commute with σj , but not with the beable variables si . Therefore, an observer of the
137

beable states, in the beable basis, will ﬁnd it diﬃcult to identify our operators Li . It will
be easy for such an observer to identify operators Lont
i
, which generate rotations of the qi
variables while commuting with si . He might also want to rotate the Pauli-like variables
si , employing a rotation operator such as
1
2si , but that will not do, ﬁrst, because they
no longer obviously relate to spin, but foremost, because the si in the conventional basis
have a much less trivial dependence on the angles θ and ϕ , see Eqs. (15.29) and (15.31).
Actually, the reconstruction of the ⃗x operators from the beables will show a non-
trivial dependence on the variables si and the angles θ and ϕ . This is because ⃗x and
the si do not commute. From the deﬁnitions (15.29) and the expressions (15.29) for the
the vectors ˆθ and ˆϕ , one derives, from judicious calculations:
[xi, θj]

(15.50)
The expression q3/
p
1 −q2
3 = cot(θ) emerging here is singular at the poles, clearly due
to the vortices there in the deﬁnitions of the angular directions θ and ϕ .
From these expressions, we now deduce the commutators of xi and s1,2,3 :

(15.53)
In the last expression Eq. (15.43) for ⃗σ was used. Now, observe that these equations can
be written more compactly:

(15.54)
To proceed correctly, we now need also to know how the angular momentum operators
Li commute with s1,2,3 . Write Li = εijkxj ˆqk pr , where only the functions xi do not
commute with the sj . It is then easy to use Eqs. (15.51)—(15.54) to ﬁnd the desired
commutators:
[Li, sj] = 1

(15.55)
where we used the simple orthonormality relations (15.30) for the unit vectors ˆθ, ˆϕ , and
ˆq . Now, this means that we can ﬁnd new operators Lont
i
that commute with all the sj :

138

as was anticipated in Eq. 15.36. It is then of interest to check the commutator of two of
the new “angular momentum” operators. One thing we know: according to the Jacobi
identity, the commutator of two operators Lont
i
must also commute with all sj . Now,
expression (15.56) seems to be the only one that is of the form expected, and commutes
with all s operators. It can therefore be anticipated that the commutator of two Lont
operators should again yield an Lont operator, because other expressions could not pos-
sibly commute with all s . The explicit calculation of the commutator is a bit awkward.
For instance, one must not forget that Li also commutes non-trivially with cot(θ) :
[Li,
q3

(15.57)
But then, indeed, one ﬁnds
h

(15.58)
The commutation rules with qi and with r and pr were not aﬀected by the additional
terms:
[Lont
i
, qj] = iεijk qk ,
[Lont
i
, r] = [Lont
i
, pr] = 0 .
(15.59)
This conﬁrms that we now indeed have the generator for rotations of the beables qi , while
it does not aﬀect the other beables si, r and pr .
Thus, to ﬁnd the correct expression for the operators ⃗x in terms of the beable variables,
we replace Li in Eq. (15.46) by Lont
i
, leading to
xi = qi (r −i
pr
) + εijk qj Lont

(15.60)
This remarkable expression shows that, in terms of the beable variables, the ⃗x coordi-
nates undergo ﬁnite, angle-dependent displacements proportional to our sign ﬂip operators
s1, s2 , and s3 . These displacements are in the plane. However, the operator 1/pr does
something else. From Eq. (15.47) we infer that, in the r variable,
⟨r1| 1
pr
|r2⟩= 1
2i sgn(r1 −r2) .
(15.61)
Returning now to a remark made earlier in this chapter, one might decide to use the
sign operator s3 (or some combination of the three s variables) to distinguish opposite
signs of the ˆq operators. The angles θ and ϕ then occupy the domains that are more
usual for an S2 sphere: 0 < θ < π , and 0 < ϕ ≤2π . In that case, the operators s1,2,3
refer to the signs of ˆq3, r and pr . Not much would be gained by such a notation.
The Hamiltonian in the conventional basis is
H = ⃗σ · ⃗p .
(15.62)
139

It is linear in the momenta pi , but it also depends on the non commuting Pauli matrices
σi .
This is why the conventional basis cannot be used directly to see that this is a
deterministic model. Now, in our ontological basis, this becomes
H = s pr .
(15.63)
Thus, it multiplies one momentum variable with the commuting operator s . The Hamil-
ton equation reads
dr
dt = s ,
(15.64)
while all other beables stay constant. This is how our ‘neutrino’ model became determin-
istic. In the basis of states | ˆq, r, s ⟩our model clearly describes planar sheets at distance
r from the origin, oriented in the direction of the unit vector ˆq , moving with the velocity
of light in a transverse direction, given by the sign of s .
Once we deﬁned, in the basis of the two eigenvalues of s , the two other operators s1
and s2 , with (see Eqs. (15.32))

we can write, in the ‘ontological’ basis, the conventional ‘neutrino’ operators ⃗σ (Eq.
(15.43)), ⃗x (Eq. (15.60)), and ⃗p (Eq. (15.42)). By construction, these will obey the
correct commutation relations.
15.2.2.
Orthonormality and transformations of the ‘neutrino’ beable states
The quantities that we now wish to determine are the inner products
⟨⃗x, σz|θ, ϕ, s, r⟩,
⟨⃗p, σz|θ, ϕ, s, r⟩.
(15.67)
The states | θ, ϕ, s, r⟩will henceforth be written as | ˆq, s, r⟩.
The use of momentum
variables ˆq ≡±⃗p/|p| , qz > 0, together with a real parameter r inside a Dirac bracket
will always denote a beable state in this subsection.
Special attention is required for the proper normalisation of the various sets of eigen-
states. We assume the following normalisations:
⟨⃗x, α | ⃗x ′, β⟩
=
δ3(⃗x −⃗x ′) δαβ ,
(15.68)
⟨⃗p, α | ⃗p ′, β⟩
=
δ3(⃗p −⃗p ′) δαβ ,
(15.69)
⟨⃗x, α | ⃗p, β⟩
=
(2π)−3/2 ei ⃗p·⃗x δαβ ;
(15.70)
⟨ˆq, r, s | ˆq ′, r′, s′ ⟩
=
δ2(ˆq, ˆq ′) δ(r −r′) δs s′ ,
(15.71)
δ2(ˆq, ˆq′)
≡

which gives, after normalising the spinors,

α was imposed, but also
s α

α = χ∓
β ,
s α
2 β χ±
α = ± i χ∓

(15.76)
which implies a constraint on the relative phases of χ+
α and χ−
α . The sign in the second of
these equations is understood if we realise that the index s here, and later in Eq. (15.80),
is an upper index.
Next, we need to know how the various Dirac deltas are normalised:
d3⃗p = p2
r d2ˆq dpr ;
δ3(ˆq pr −ˆq ′ pr
′) = 1
p2
r
δ2(ˆq, ˆq ′) δ(pr −pr

(15.79)
which can easily be seen to imply39
⟨⃗p, α | ˆq, pr, s⟩= pr δ3(⃗p −ˆq pr)χs
α(ˆq) ,
(15.80)
since the norm p2
r has to be divided over the two matrix terms in Eqs (15.78) and (15.79).
39Note that the phases in these matrix elements could be deﬁned at will, so we could have chosen |p|
in stead of pr . Our present choice is for future convenience.
141

This brings us to derive, using ⟨r | pr ⟩= (2π)−1/2 e i pr r ,

The Dirac delta in here can also be denoted as
δ2±⃗p
|p| , ˆq

= (ˆq · ⃗p )2 δ2(⃗p ∧ˆq) ,
(15.82)
where the ﬁrst term is a normalisation to ensure the expression to become scale invariant,
and the second just forces ⃗p and ˆq to be parallel or antiparallel. In the case ˆq = (0, 0, 1) ,
this simply describes p2
3 δ(p1) δ(p2) .
Finally then, we can derive the matrix elements ⟨⃗x, α | ˆq, r, s ⟩. Just temporarily, we
put ˆq in the 3-direction: ˆq = (0, 0, 1) ,

(15.83)
With these equations, our transformation laws are now complete. We have all matrix
elements to show how to go from one basis to another. Note, that the states with vanishing
pr , the momentum of the sheets, generate singularities. Thus, we see that the states | ψ ⟩
with ⟨pr = 0 | ψ ⟩̸= 0 , or equivalently, ⟨⃗p = 0 | ψ ⟩̸= 0 , must be excluded. We call such
states ‘edge states’, since they have wave functions that are constant in space (in r and
also in ⃗x ), which means that they stretch to the ‘edge’ of the universe. There is an issue
here concerning the boundary conditions at inﬁnity, which we will need to avoid. We see
that the operator 1/pr , Eq. (15.47), is ill deﬁned for these states.
15.2.3.
Second quantisation of the ‘neutrinos’
Being a relativistic Dirac fermion, the object described in this chapter so-far suﬀers from
the problem that its Hamiltonian, (15.25) and (15.63), is not bounded from below. There
are positive and negative energy states. The cure will be the same as the one used by
Dirac, and we will use it again later: second quantisation.
We follow the procedure
described in section 15.1: for every given value of the unit vector ˆq , we consider an
unlimited number of ‘neutrinos’, which can be in positive or negative energy states. To
be more speciﬁc, one might, temporarily, put the variables r on a discrete lattice:
r = rn = n δr ,
(15.84)
but often we ignore this, or in other words, we let δr tend to zero.
142

We now describe these particles, having spin
1
2 , by anti-commuting fermionic opera-
tors. We have operator ﬁelds ψα(⃗x ) and ψ†
α(⃗x ) obeying anticommutation rules,
{ψα(⃗x ), ψ†
β(⃗x ′ )} = δ3(⃗x −⃗x ′)δαβ .
(15.85)
Using the transformation rules of subsection 15.2.2, we can transform these ﬁelds into
ﬁelds ψ(ˆq, r, s) and ψ†(ˆq, r, s) obeying
{ψ(ˆq, r, s), ψ†(ˆq ′, r′, s′ )} = δ2(ˆq, ˆq ′ ) δ(r −r′)δs s′ →δ2(ˆq, ˆq ′) δn n′ δs s′ .
(15.86)
At any given value of ˆq (which could also be chosen discrete if so desired), we have
a straight line of r values, limited to the lattice points (15.84). On a stretch of N sites
of this lattice, we can imagine any number of fermions, ranging from 0 to N . Each of
these fermions obeys the same evolution law (15.64), and therefore also the entire system
is deterministic.
There is no need to worry about the introduction of anti-commuting fermionic opera-
tors (15.85), (15.86). The minus signs are handled through the Jordan-Wigner transfor-
mation, implying that the creation or annihilation of a fermion that has an odd number of
fermions at one side of it, will be accompanied by an artiﬁcial minus sign. This minus sign
has no physical origin but is exclusively introduced in order to facilitate the mathematics
with anti-commuting ﬁelds. Because, at any given value of ˆq , the fermions propagate
on a single line, and they all move with the same speed in one direction, the Jordan-
Wigner transformation is without complications. Of course, we still have not introduced
interactions among the fermions, which indeed would not be easy as yet.
This ‘second quantised’ version of the neutrino model has one big advantage: we can
describe it using a Hamiltonian that is bounded from below. The argument is identical
to Dirac’s own ingenious procedure. The Hamiltonian of the second quantised system is
(compare the ﬁrst quantised Hamiltonian (15.25)):

(15.88)
Let us denote the ﬁeld in the standard notation as ψ stand
α
(⃗x) or ψ stand
α
(⃗p) , and the
ﬁeld in the ‘beable’ basis as ψont
s (ˆq, r) . Its Fourier transform is not a beable ﬁeld, but
to distinguish it from the standard notation we will sometimes indicate it nevertheless as
ψont
s (ˆq, pr) .
In momentum space, we have (see Eq. 15.39):

although we did the Fourier transform replacing the variable r by its momentum variable
pr . The normalisation is such that

In our case, ψ has only two spin modes, it is a Weyl ﬁeld, but in all other respects
it can be handled just as a massless Dirac ﬁeld. Following Dirac, in momentum space,
each momentum ⃗p has two energy eigenmodes (eigenvectors of the operator h β
α
in the
Hamiltonian (15.87)), which we write, properly normalised, as

(15.97)
where a1 is the annihilation operator for a particle with momentum ⃗p , and a†
2 is the
creation operator for an antiparticle with momentum −⃗p . We drop the vacuum energy
−1 . In case we have a lattice in r space, the momentum is limited to the values |⃗p | =
|pr| < π/δr .
15.3.
The ‘neutrino’ vacuum correlations
The vacuum state |∅⟩is the state of lowest energy. This means that, at each momentum
value ⃗p or equivalently, at each (ˆq, pr) , we have
ai|∅⟩= 0 ,
(15.98)
where ai is the annihilation operator for all states with H = σ · ⃗p = s pr > 0 , and the
creation operator if H < 0 . The beable states are the states where, at each value of
the set (ˆq, r, s) the number of ‘particles’ is speciﬁed to be either 1 or 0. This means,
144

of course, that the vacuum state (15.98) is not a beable state; it is a superposition of all
beable states.
One may for instance compute the correlation functions of right- and left moving
‘particles’ (sheets, actually) in a given direction. In the beable (ontological) basis, one
ﬁnds that left-movers are not correlated to right movers, but two left-movers are correlated
as follows:
P(r1, r2) −P(r1)P(r2)

(15.99)
where δr 2 , the unit of distance between two adjacent sheets squared, was added for
normalisation, and ‘conn’ stands for the connected diagram contribution only, that is,
the particle and antiparticle created at r2 are both annihilated at r1 . The same applies
to two right movers. In the case of a lattice, where δr is not yet tuned to zero, this
calculation is still exact if r1 −r2 is an integer multiple of δr . Note that, for the vacuum,
P(r) = P(r, r) = 1
2 .
An important point about the second quantised Hamiltonian (15.87), (15.88): on the
lattice, we wish to keep the Hamiltonian (15.97) in momentum space. In position space,
Eqs. (15.87) or (15.88) cannot be valid since one cannot diﬀerentiate in the space variable
r .
But we can have the induced evolution operator over ﬁnite integer time intervals
T = nt δr . This evolution operator then displaces left movers one step to the left and
right movers one step to the right. The Hamiltonian (15.97) does exactly that, while it
can be used also for inﬁnitesimal times; it is however not quite local when re-expressed
in terms of the ﬁelds on the lattice coordinates, since now momentum is limited to stay
within the Brillouin zone |pr| < π/δr . This feature, which here does not lead to serious
complications, is further explained, for the bosonic case, in section 17.1.1.
Correlations of data at two points that are separated in space but not in time, or
not suﬃciently far in the time-like direction to allow light signals to connect these two
points, are called space-like correlations. The space-like correlations found in Eq. (15.99)
are important. They probably play an important role in the mysterious behaviour of the
beable models when Bell’s inequalities are considered, see part I, chapter 3.6 and beyond.
Note that we are dealing here with space-like correlations of the ontological degrees of
freedom. The correlations are a consequence of the fact that we are looking at a special
state that is preserved in time, a state we call the vacuum. All physical states normally
encountered are template states, deviating only very slightly from this vacuum state, so
we will always have such correlations.
In the chapters about Bell inequalities and the Cellular Automaton Interpretation
(section 5.2 and chapter 3 of part I ), it is argued that the ontological theories proposed in
this book must feature strong, space-like correlations throughout the universe. This would
be the only way to explain how the Bell, or CHSH inequalities can be so strongly violated
in these models. Now since our ‘neutrinos’ are non interacting, one cannot really do EPR-
145

like experiments with them, so already for that reason, there is no direct contradiction.
However, we also see that strong space-like correlations are present in this model.
Indeed, one’s ﬁrst impression might be that the ontological ‘neutrino sheet’ model of
the previous section is entirely non local. The sheets stretch out inﬁnitely far in two
directions, and if a sheet moves here, we immediately have some information about what
it does elsewhere.
But on closer inspection one should concede that the equations of
motion are entirely local. These equations tell us that if we have a sheet going through
a space-time point x , carrying a sign function s , and oriented in the direction ˆq , then,
at the point x , the sheet will move with the speed of light in the direction dictated by ˆq
and σ . No information is needed from points elsewhere in the universe. This is locality.
The thing that is non local is the ubiquitous correlations in this model. If we have a
sheet at (⃗x, t) , oriented in a direction ˆq , we instantly know that the same sheet will occur
at other points (⃗y, t) , if ˆq · (⃗y −⃗x ) = 0 , and it has the same values for ˆq and σ . It will
be explained in chapter 20, section 20.7, that space-like correlations are normal in physics,
both in classical systems such as crystals or star clusters and in quantum mechanical ones
such as quantised ﬁelds. In the neutrino sheets, the correlations are even stronger, so that
assuming their absence is a big mistake when one tries to draw conclusions from Bell’s
theorem.

PQ theory
Most quantum theories describe operators whose eigenvalues form continua of real num-
bers. Examples are one or more particles in some potential well, harmonic oscillators,
but also bosonic quantum ﬁelds and strings. If we want to relate these to deterministic
systems we could consider ontological observables that take values in the real numbers as
well. There is however an other option.
One important application of the transformations described in this book could be our
attempts to produce fundamental theories about nature at the Planck scale. Here, we have
the holographic principle at work, and the Bekenstein bound [30]. What these tell us is
that Hilbert space assigned to any small domain of space should be ﬁnite-dimensional. In
contrast, real numbers are described by unlimited sequences of digits and therefore require
inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces. That’s too large. One may suspect that uncertainty
relations, or non-commutativity, add some blur to these numbers. In this chapter, we
outline a mathematical procedure for a systematic approach.
For PQ theory, as our approach will be called, we employed a new notation in earlier
work [91][92], where not ℏbut h is normalised to one. Wave functions then take the
form e 2πipx = ϵ ipx , where ϵ = e2π = 535.5 . This notation was very useful to avoid
factors 1/
√
2π for the normalisation of wave functions on a circle. Yet we decided not
to use such notation in this book, so as to avoid clashes with other discussions in the
standard notation in various other chapters. Therefore, we return to the normalisation
ℏ= 1 . Factors
√
2π (for normalised states) will now occur more frequently, and hopefully
they won’t deter the reader.
146

In this chapter, and part of the following ones, dynamical variables can be real num-
bers, indicated with lower case letters: p, q, r, x, · · · , they can be integers indicated by
capitals: N, P, Q, X, · · · , or they are angles (numbers deﬁned on a circle), indicated
by Greek letters α, η, κ, ϱ, · · · , usually obeying −π < α ≤π , or sometimes deﬁned
merely modulo 2π .
A real number r , for example the number r = 137.035999074 · · · , is composed of
an integer, here R = 137 , and an angle, ϱ/2π = 0.035999074 · · · . In examples such as
a quantum particle on a line, Hilbert space is spanned by a basis deﬁned on the line:
{ | r ⟩} . In PQ theory, we regard such a Hilbert space as the product of Hilbert space
spanned by the integers | R ⟩and Hilbert space spanned by the angles, | ϱ ⟩. So, we have
1
√
2π | r ⟩= | R, ϱ ⟩= | R ⟩| ϱ ⟩.
(16.1)
Note that continuity of a wave function |ψ⟩implies twisted boundary conditions:
⟨R + 1, ϱ |ψ⟩= ⟨R, ϱ + 2π |ψ⟩.
(16.2)
The fractional part, or angle, is deﬁned unambiguously, but the deﬁnition of the integral
part depends on how the angle is projected on the segment [0, 2π] , or: how exactly do
we round a real number to its integer value? We’ll take care of that when the question
arises.
So far our introduction; it suggests that we can split up a coordinate q into an integer
part Q and a fractional part ξ/2π and its momentum into an integer part 2πP and a
fractional part κ . Now we claim that this can be done in such a way that both [P, Q] = 0
and [ξ, κ] = 0 .
Let us set up our algebra as systematically as possible.
16.1.
The algebra of ﬁnite displacements
Let there be given an operator qop with non-degenerate eigenstates |q⟩having eigenvalues
q spanning the entire real line. The associated momentum operator is pop with eigenstates
|p⟩having eigenvalues p , also spanning the real line. The usual quantum mechanical
notation, now with ℏ= 1 , is
qop|q⟩= q|q⟩;
pop|p⟩= p|p⟩;
[qop, pop] = i ;
⟨q|q ′⟩= δ(q −q ′) ;
⟨p|p ′⟩= δ(p −p ′) ;
⟨q|p⟩=
1
√
2πeipq
(16.3)
(often, we will omit the subscript “op” denoting that we refer to an operator, if this should
be clear from the context)
Consider now the displacement operators e−ipopa in position space, and eiqopb in mo-
mentum space, where a and b are real numbers:
e−ipop a|q⟩= |q + a⟩;
eiqop b|p⟩= |p + b⟩.
(16.4)
147

We have
[qop , pop ] = i ,
eiqop b pop = (pop −b) eiqop b ;
eiqop b e−ipop a = e−ipop a eiab eiqop b
= e−ipop a eiqop b ,
if ab = 2π × integer .
(16.5)
Let us consider the displacement operator in position space for a = 1 . It is unitary,
and therefore can be written uniquely as e−iκ , where κ is a hermitean operator with
eigenvalues κ obeying −π < κ ≤π . As we see in Eq. (16.4), κ also represents the
momentum modulo 2π . Similarly, eiξ , with −π < ξ ≤π , is deﬁned to be an operator
that causes a shift in the momentum by a step b = 2π . This means that ξ/2π is the
position operator q modulo one. We write
p = 2πK + κ ,
q = X + ξ/2π ,
(16.6)
where both K and X are integers and κ and ξ are angles. We suggest that the reader
ignore the factors 2π at ﬁrst reading; these will only be needed when doing precise
calculations.
16.1.1.
From the one-dimensional inﬁnite line to the two-dimensional torus
As should be clear from Eqs. (16.5), we can regard the angle κ as the generator of a shift
in the integer X , and the angle ξ as generating a shift in K :
e−iκ | X ⟩= | X + 1 ⟩,
eiξ | K ⟩= | K + 1 ⟩.
(16.7)
Since κ and ξ are uniquely deﬁned as generating these elementary shifts, we deduce
from Eqs. (16.5) and (16.7) that
[ξ, κ] = 0 .
(16.8)
Thus, consider the torus spanned by the eigenvalues of the operators κ and ξ .
We
now claim that the Hilbert space generated by the eigenstates |κ, ξ⟩is equivalent to the
Hilbert space spanned by the eigenstates |q⟩of the operator qop , or equivalently, the
eigenstates |p⟩of the operator pop (with the exception of exactly one state, see later).
It is easiest now to consider the states deﬁned on this torus, but we must proceed
with care. If we start with a wave function |ψ⟩that is continuous in q , we have twisted
periodic boundary conditions, as indicated in Eq. (16.2). Here, in the ξ coordinate,
⟨X + 1, ξ |ψ⟩
=
⟨X, ξ + 2π |ψ⟩,
or
⟨κ, ξ + 2π |ψ⟩
=
⟨κ, ξ |eiκ|ψ⟩,
(16.9)
whereas, since this wave function assumes X to be integer, we have strict periodicity in
κ :
⟨κ + 2π, ξ |ψ⟩= ⟨κ, ξ |ψ⟩.
(16.10)
148

If we would consider the same state in momentum space, the periodic boundary condi-
tions would be the other way around, and this is why, in the expression used here, the
transformations from position space to momentum space and back are non-trivial. For our
subsequent calculations, it is much better to transform ﬁrst to a strictly periodic torus.
To this end, we introduce a phase function φ(κ, ξ) with the following properties:
φ(κ, ξ + 2π) = φ(κ, ξ) + κ;
φ(κ + 2π, ξ) = φ(κ, ξ) ;
(16.11)
φ(κ, ξ) = −φ(−κ, ξ) = −φ(κ, −ξ) ;
φ(κ, ξ) + φ(ξ, κ) = κξ/2π .
(16.12)
An explicit expression for such a function is derived in section 16.2 and summarised in
section 16.3. Here, we just note that this function suﬀers from a singularity at the point
(κ = ±π, ξ = ±π) . This singularity is an inevitable consequence of the demands (16.11)
and (16.12). It is a topological defect that can be moved around on the torus, but not
disposed of.
Transforming |ψ⟩now with the unitary transformation
⟨κ, ξ|ψ⟩= ⟨κ, ξ|U(κ, ξ)| ˜ψ⟩;
U(κ, ξ) = eiφ(κ, ξ) = eiκξ/2π−iφ(ξ, κ) ,
(16.13)
turns the boundary conditions (16.9) and (16.10) both into strictly periodic boundaries
for | ˜ψ⟩.
For the old wave function, we had X = i∂/∂κ , so, qop = i∂/∂κ+ξ/2π . The operator
pop would simply be −2πi∂/∂ξ , assuming that the boundary condition (16.9) ensures
that this reduces to the usual diﬀerential operator. Our new, transformed wave function
now requires a modiﬁcation of these operators to accommodate for the unusual phase
factor φ(κ, ξ) . Now our two operators become
qop

∂ξ + κ −2π
 ∂
∂ξφ(ξ, κ)

. (16.15)
This is how the introduction of a phase factor φ(κ, ξ) can restore the symmetry be-
tween the operators qop and pop . Note that, although φ is not periodic, the derivative
∂φ(κ, ξ)/∂ξ is periodic, and therefore, both qop and pop are strictly periodic in κ and
ξ (beware the reﬂections ξ ↔κ in Eqs. (16.14) and (16.15)).
We check that they obey the correct commutation rule:
[qop, pop] = i .
(16.16)
It is very important that these operators are periodic. It implies that we have no theta
jumps in their deﬁnitions. If we had not introduced the phase function φ(κ, ξ) , we would
have such theta jumps and in such descriptions the matrix elements in Q, P space would
be much less convergent.
The operators i∂/∂κ and −i∂/∂ξ now do not exactly correspond to the operators X
and K anymore, because of the last terms in Eqs. (16.14) and (16.15). They are integers
149

however, which obviously commute, and these we shall call Q and P . To obtain the
operators qop and pop in the basis of the states |Q, P⟩, we simply expand the wave
functions in κ, ξ space in terms of the Fourier modes,
⟨κ, ξ | Q, P ⟩= 1
2πeiPξ−iQκ .
(16.17)
We now need the Fourier coeﬃcients of the phase function φ(κ, ξ) . They are given in
section 16.2, where we also derive the explicit expressions for the operators qop and pop
in the Q, P basis:
qop = Qop + aop ;
⟨Q1, P1| Qop |Q2, P2⟩
=
Q1 δQ1 Q2 δP1 P2 ,
⟨Q1, P1| aop |Q2, P2⟩
=
(−1)P+Q+1 iP
2π(P 2 + Q2) ,
(16.18)
where Q stands short for Q2 −Q1 , and P = P2 −P1 .
For the p operator, it is derived analogously,
pop = 2πPop + bop ,
⟨Q1, P1|Pop|Q2, P2⟩= P1 δQ1Q2δP1P2 ;
(16.19)
⟨Q1, P1| bop |Q2, P2⟩
= (−1)P+Q iQ
P 2 + Q2
.
(16.20)
And now for some surprise. Let us inspect the commutator, [ qop, pop ] , in the basis of
the integers Q and P . We have
[Qop, Pop] = 0 ;
[ aop, bop ] = 0 ;
[qop, pop] = [Qop, bop ] + 2π[ aop, Pop] ;
⟨Q1, P1| [ qop, pop ] |Q2, P2⟩= −i(−1)P+Q)(1 −δQ1Q2δP1P2) .
(16.21)
Here, the delta function is inserted because the commutator vanishes if Q1 = Q2 and
P1 = P2 . So, the commutator is not equal to i times the identity, but it can be written
as
[ qop, pop ] = i ( I −| ψe ⟩⟨ψe | ) ,
where ⟨Q, P| ψe ⟩= (−1)P+Q .
(16.22)
Apparently, there is one state |ψe⟩(with inﬁnite norm), for which the standard commuta-
tor rule is violated. We encounter more such states in this book, to be referred to as edge
states, that have to be factored out of our Hilbert space. From a physical point of view it
will usually be easy to ignore the edge states, but when we do mathematical calculations
it is important to understand their nature. The edge state here coincides with the state
δ(κ−π) δ(ξ −π) , so its mathematical origin is easy to spot: it is located at the singularity
of our auxiliary phase function φ(κ, ξ) , the one we observed following Eqs. (16.11) and
(16.12); apparently, we must limit ourselves to wave functions that vanish at that spot in
(κ, ξ ) space.
150

16.1.2.
The states |Q, P⟩in the q basis
As in other chapters, we now wish to identify the transformation matrix enabling us
to transform from one basis to an other.
Thus, we wish to ﬁnd the matrix elements
connecting states |Q, P⟩to states |q⟩or to states |p⟩.
If we can ﬁnd the function
⟨q|0, 0⟩, which gives the wave function in q space of the state with Q = P = 0 , ﬁnding
the rest will be easy. Section 16.4, shows the derivation of this wave function. In (κ, ξ)
space, the state |q⟩is
⟨κ, ξ |q⟩= ei φ(κ,2πq) δ(ξ −ξq) ,
(16.23)
if q is written as q = X + ξq/2π , and X is an integer. Section 16.4 shows that then the
wave function for P = Q = 0 is
⟨q|0, 0⟩=
1
2π
Z 2π
0
dκ e−iφ(κ,2πq) .
(16.24)
The general wave function is obtained by shifting P and Q by integer amounts:
⟨q|Q, P⟩=
1
2π e2πiPq
Z 2π
0
dκ e−iφ(κ, 2π(q−Q)) .
(16.25)
The wave function (16.24), which is equal to its own Fourier transform, is special
because it is close to a block wave, having just very small tails outside the domain |q| < 1
2 ,
see Fig. 13
The wave ⟨q|Q, P⟩is similar to the so-called wavelets [48], which are sometimes used
to describe pulsed waves, but this one has two extra features. Not only is it equal to its
own Fourier transform, it is also orthogonal to itself when shifted by an integer. This
makes the set of waves |Q, P⟩in Eq. (16.25) an orthonormal basis.
This PQ formalism is intended to be used to transform systems based on integer
numbers only, to systems based on real numbers, and back. The integers may be assumed
to undergo switches described by a permutation operator Pop . After identifying some
useful expression for a Hamiltonian Hop , with Pop = e−iHop δt , one can now transform
this to a quantum system with that Hamiltonian in its new basis.
For a single PQ pair, constructing a deterministic model whose evolution operator
resembles a realistic quantum Hamiltonian is diﬃcult.
A precise, canonical, discrete
Hamiltonian formalism is possible in the PQ scheme, but it requires some more work that
we postpone to section 19. Interesting Hamiltonians are obtained in the multidimensional
case: Pi, Qi . Such a system is considered in chapter 17.
16.2.
Transformations in the PQ theory
The following sections, with which we end chapter 16, can be read as Appendices to
chapter 16. They contain technicalities most readers might not be interested in, but they
are needed to understand the details of some features that were encountered, in particular

when explicit calculations have to be done, connecting the basis sets of the real numbers
q , their Fourier transforms p , the integers (Q, P) and the torus (κ, ξ) .
Let us ﬁrst construct a solution to the boundary conditions (16.11) and (16.12) for a
phase function φ(κ, ξ) ,
φ(κ, ξ + 2π) = φ(κ, ξ) + κ;
φ(κ + 2π, ξ) = φ(κ, ξ) ;
(16.26)
φ(κ, ξ) = −φ(−κ, ξ) = −φ(κ, −ξ) ;
φ(κ, ξ) + φ(ξ, κ) = κξ/2π .
(16.27)
At ﬁrst sight, these conditions appear to be contradictory. If we follow a closed contour
(κ, ξ) = (0, 0) →(2π, 0) →(2π, 2π) →(0, 2π) →(0, 0) , we pick up a term 2π . This
implies that a function that is single valued everywhere does not exist, hence, we must
have a singularity. We can write down an amplitude ψ(κ, ξ) = r eiφ of which this is the
phase, but this function must have a zero or a pole. Let’s assume it has a zero, and r is
simply periodic. Then one can ﬁnd the smoothest solution. If r and φ are real functions:
r(κ, ξ) eiφ(κ, ξ) =
∞
X
N=−∞
e−π(N−ξ
2π )2+iNκ ,
(16.28)
one ﬁnds that this is obviously periodic in κ , while the substitution
ξ →ξ + 2π ,
N →N + 1 ,
(16.29)
152

gives the ﬁrst part of Eq. (16.26).
The sum in Eq. (16.28), which fortunately converges rapidly, is a special case of the
elliptic function ϑ3 , and it can also be written as a product [27]:
r(κ, ξ) eiφ(κ,ξ) = e−ξ2

(16.30)
from which we can easily read oﬀthe zeros: they are at (κ, ξ) = (2πN1 + π, 2πN2 + π) .
We deliberately chose these to be at the corners (±π, ±π) of the torus, but it does not
really matter where they are; they are simply unavoidable.
The matrix elements ⟨Q1, P1| qop |Q2, P2⟩are obtained by ﬁrst calculating them on
the torus. We have40
qop = Qop + a(ξ, κ) ;
Qop = i ∂
∂κ ,
a(ξ, κ) =

.
(16.31)
To calculate a(ξ, κ) we can best take the product formula (16.30):

Evaluation gives (note the interchange of κ and ξ ):
aN(ξ, κ) =

2 sin ξ
cos ξ + cosh(κ −2πN −π) +

2 sin ξ
cos ξ + cosh(κ + 2πN + π) ,
(16.33)
which now allows us to rewrite it as a single sum for N running from −∞to ∞instead
of 0 to ∞.
Let us ﬁrst transform from the ξ basis to the P basis, leaving κ unchanged. This
turns a(ξ, κ) into an operator aop . With
⟨P1|ξ⟩⟨ξ|P2⟩=
1
2πeiPξ ,
P = P2 −P1 ,
(16.34)
we get the matrix elements of the operator aop in the (P, κ) frame:

where
sgn(P) is deﬁned to be ±1 if P >< 0 and 0 if P = 0 . The absolute value
taken in the exponent indeed means that we always have a negative exponent there; it
originated when the contour integral over the unit circle forced us to choose a pole inside
the unit circle.
Next, we ﬁnd the (Q, P) matrix elements by integrating this over κ with a factor
⟨Q1|κ⟩⟨κ|Q2⟩=
1
2πeiQ κ , with Q = Q2 −Q1 . The sum over N and the integral over κ
from 0 to 2π combine into an integral over all real values of κ , to obtain the remarkably
simple expression
⟨Q1, P1| aop |Q2, P2⟩= (−1)P+Q+1 iP
2π(P 2 + Q2) .
(16.37)
In Eq. (16.14), this gives for the q operator:
qop
=
Qop + aop ;
⟨Q1, P1| qop |Q2, P2⟩
=
Q1 δQ1 Q2 δP1 P2 + ⟨Q1, P1| aop |Q2, P2⟩.
(16.38)
For the p operator, the role of Eq. (16.31) is played by
pop = 2πP + b(κ, ξ) ;
P = −i ∂

b(κ, ξ) = 2π

(16.39)
and one obtains analogously, writing P ≡P2 −P1 ,
pop = 2πPop + bop ,
⟨Q1, P1|Pop|Q2, P2⟩= P1 δQ1Q2δP1P2 ;
(16.40)
⟨Q1, P1| bop |Q2, P2⟩
= (−1)P+Q iQ
P 2 + Q2
.
(16.41)
Note, in all these expressions, we have the symmetry under the combined interchange
p op ↔2π q op ,
P ↔Q ,
X ↔K ,
ξ ↔κ ,
i ↔−i ,
2π a op ↔b op .
(16.42)
16.3.
Resume of the quasi-periodic phase function φ(ξ, κ)
Let Q and P be integers while ξ and κ obey −π < ξ < π , −π < κ < π . The operators
obey
[Qop, Pop] = [ξop, Pop] = [Qop, κop] = [ξop, κop] = 0 .

(16.44)
The phase angle functions φ and ˜φ are deﬁned obeying (16.26) and (16.27), and
˜φ(ξ, κ) = φ(κ, ξ) ,
φ(ξ, κ) + ˜φ(ξ, κ) = ξκ/2π .
(16.45)
154

When computing matrix elements, we should not take the operator φ itself, since it is
pseudo periodic instead of periodic, so that the edge state δ(κ ± π) gives singularities.
Instead, the operator ∂φ(ξ, κ)/∂κ ≡a(ξ, κ) is periodic, so we start from that. Note
that, on the (ξ, κ) -torus, our calculations often force us to interchange the order of the
variables ξ and κ . Thus, in a slightly modiﬁed notation,
a(ξ, κ) =
∞

N=−∞
aN(ξ, κ) ;
aN(ξ, κ) =

With P2 −P1 ≡P , we write in the (κ, P) basis

Conversely, we can derive in the (Q, ξ) basis, with Q2 −Q1 ≡Q :

(the latter expression is found by contour integration).

⟨Q1, P1|aop|Q2, P2⟩= −i

The operators qop and pop are now deﬁned on the torus as
qop(κ, ξ) = Qop + a(ξ, κ) ,
pop(κ, ξ) = 2π(Pop + a(κ, ξ)) ,
(16.50)
with Qop = i∂/∂κ ,
Pop = −i∂/∂ξ . This reproduces Eqs. (16.37) and (16.41).
16.4.
The wave function of the state |0, 0⟩
We calculate the state |q⟩in the (κ, ξ) torus. Its wave equation is (see Eq. (16.14))
qop|q⟩= i eiφ(ξ,κ) ∂
∂κ

e−iφ(ξ,κ) |q⟩

= q|q⟩.
(16.51)
This equation is easy to solve:
⟨κ, ξ|q⟩= C(ξ) eiφ(ξ,κ)−iqκ .
(16.52)
155

Since the solution must be periodic in κ and ξ , while we have the periodicity condi-
tions (16.26) for φ , we deduce that this only has a solution if ξ/2π is the fractional part
of q , or, q = X + ξ/2π , where X is integer. In that case, we can write
⟨κ, ξ|q⟩= C(ξ) e−iXκ−iφ(κ,ξ) = C(ξ) e−iφ(κ,2πq) .
(16.53)
The complete matrix element is then, writing q = X + ξq/2π ,
⟨κ, ξ|q⟩= C e−iφ(κ,2πq) δ(ξ −ξq)
(16.54)
(note that the phase φ(κ, ξ) is not periodic in its second entry ξ ; the entries are reversed
compared to Eqs (16.26)). The normalisation follows from requiring

Models in two space-time dimensions without interactions
17.1.
Two dimensional model of massless bosons
An important motivation for our step from real numbers to integers is that we require
deterministic theories to be inﬁnitely precise. Any system based on a classical action,
requires real numbers for its basic variables, but this also introduces limited precision. If,
as one might be inclined to suspect, the ultimate physical degrees of freedom merely form
bits and bytes, then these can only be discrete, and the prototypes of discrete systems are
the integers. Perhaps later one might want to replace these by integers with a maximal
size, such as integers modulo a prime number p , the elements of Z/pZ .
The question is how to phrase a systematic approach. For instance, how do we mimic
a quantum ﬁeld theory? If such a theory is based on perturbative expansions, can we
156

mimic such expansions in terms of integers? Needless to observe that standard pertur-
bation expansions seem to be impossible for discrete systems, but various special kinds
of expansions can still be imagined, such as 1/N expansions, where N could be some
characteristic of an underlying algebra.
We shall not be able to do this in this book, but we make a start at formulating
systematic approaches. In this chapter, we consider a quantised ﬁeld, whose ﬁeld variables,
of course, are operators with continua of eigenvalues in the real numbers. If we want to
open the door to perturbative ﬁeld theories, we ﬁrst need to understand free particles.
One example was treated in section 15.2. These were fermions. Now, we try to introduce
free bosons.
Such theories obey linear ﬁeld equations, such as
∂2
t φ(⃗x, t) =
d
X
i=1
∂2
i φ(⃗x, t) −m2 φ(⃗x, t) .
(17.1)
In the case of fermions, we succeeded, to some extent, to formulate the massless case
in three space dimensions (section 15.2, subsection 15.2.3), but applying PQ theory to
bosonic ﬁelds in more than two dimensions has not been successful. The problem is that
equations such as Eq. (17.1) are diﬃcult to apply to integers, even if we may ﬁll the gaps
between the integers with generators of displacements.
In our search for systems where this can be done, we chose, as a compromise, massless
ﬁelds in one space-like dimension only. The reason why this special case can be handled
with PQ theory is, that the ﬁeld equation, Eq. (17.1), can be reduced to ﬁrst order
equations by distinguishing left-movers and right-movers. Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy summarise
the continuum quantum ﬁeld theory for this case.
17.1.1.
Second-quantised massless bosons in two dimensions
We consider a single, scalar, non interacting, massless ﬁeld q(x, t) . Both x and t are
one-dimensional. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are:
L = 1
2(∂tq2 −∂xq2) ;
Hop =
Z
dx(1
2p2 + 1
2∂xq2) ,
(17.2)
where we use the symbol p(x) to denote the canonical momentum ﬁeld associated to the
scalar ﬁeld q(x) , which, in the absence of interactions, obeys p(x) = ∂t q(x) . The ﬁelds
q(x) and p(x) are operator ﬁelds. The equal-time commutation rules are, as usual:
[q(x), q(y)] = [p(x), p(y)] = 0 ;
[q(x), p(y)] = iδ(x −y) .
(17.3)
Let us regard the time variable in q(x, t) and p(x, t) to be in Heisenberg notation.
We then have the ﬁeld equations:
∂2
t q = ∂2
xq ,
(17.4)
157

and the solution of the ﬁeld equations can be written as follows:
aL(x, t)
=
p(x, t) + ∂xq(x, t) = aL(x + t) ;
(17.5)
aR(x, t)
=
p(x, t) −∂xq(x, t) = aR(x −t) .
(17.6)
The equations force the operators aL to move to the left and aR to move to the right.
In terms of these variables, the Hamiltonian (at a given time t ) is
Hop =
Z
dx 1
4

(aL(x))2 + (aR(x))2
.
(17.7)
The commutation rules for aL,R are:
[aL, aR] = 0 ,
[aL(x1), aL(x2)] = 2i δ ′(x1 −x2) ,
[aR(x1), aR(x2)] = −2i δ ′(x1 −x2) ,
(17.8)
where δ ′(z) =
∂
∂zδ(z) .
Now let us Fourier transform in the space direction, by moving to momentum space
variables k , and subtract the vacuum energy. We have in momentum space (note that
we restrict ourselves to positive values of k ):
aL,R(k) =
1
√
2π
Z
dx e−ikx aL,R(x) ,
a†(k) = a(−k) ;
(17.9)
Hop =

,
(17.10)
k, k′ > 0 :
[aL(−k1), aL(−k2)] = 0 ,
[aL(−k1), aL†(−k2)] = 2k1δ(k1 −k2) .
(17.11)
[aR(k1), aR(k2)] = 0 ,
[aR(k1), aR†(k2)] = 2k1δ(k1 −k2) .
(17.12)
In this notation, aL,R(±k) are the annihilation and creation operators, apart from a factor
√
2k , so the Hamiltonian (17.7) can be written as
Hop =
Z ∞
0
dk (kN L(−k) + kN R(k)) .
(17.13)
where N L,R(∓k)dk are the occupation numbers counting the left and right moving par-
ticles. The energies of these particles are equal to the absolute values of their momentum.
All of this is completely standard and can be found in all the text books about this
subject.
Inserting a lattice cut-oﬀfor the UV divergences in quantum ﬁeld theories is also
standard practice. Restricting ourselves to integer values of the x coordinate, and using
the lattice length in x space as our unit of length, we replace the commutation rules
(17.3) by
[q(x), q(y)] = [p+(x), p+(y)] = 0 ;
[q(x), p+(y)] = i δx,y
(17.14)
158

(the reason for the superscript + will be explained later, Eqs. (17.30) — (17.32)). The
exact form of the Hamiltonian on the lattice depends on how we wish to deal with the
lattice artefacts.
The choices made below might seem somewhat artiﬁcial or special,
but it can be veriﬁed that most alternative choices one can think of can be transformed
to these by simple lattice ﬁeld transformations, so not much generality is lost.
It is
important however that we wish to keep the expression (17.13) for the Hamiltonian; also
on the lattice, we wish to keep the same dispersion law as in the continuum, so that all
excitations must move left or right exactly with the same speed of light (which of course
will be normalised to c = 1 ).
The lattice expression for the left- and right movers will be
aL(x + t)
=
p+(x, t) + q(x, t) −q(x −1, t) ;
(17.15)
aR(x −t)
=
p+(x, t) + q(x, t) −q(x + 1, t) .
(17.16)
They obey the commutation rules
[aL, aR] = 0 ;
[aL(x), aL(y)] = ± i if y = x ± 1 ;
else 0 ;
(17.17)
[aR(x), aR(y)] = ∓i if y = x ± 1 ;
else 0 .
(17.18)
They can be seen to be the lattice form of the commutators (17.8). In momentum space,
writing
aL,R(x) ≡
1
√
2π
Z
π
−π
dκ aL,R(κ) eiκx ,
aL,R †(κ) = aL,R(−κ) ;
(17.19)
the commutation rules (17.11) and (17.12) are now
[aL(−κ1), aL†(−κ2)]
=
2 sin κ1 δ(κ1 −κ2) ;
(17.20)
[aR(κ1), aR†(κ2)]
=
2 sin κ1 δ(κ1 −κ2) ,
(17.21)
so our operators aL,R(∓κ) and aL,R †(∓κ) are the usual annihilation and creation oper-
ators, multiplied by the factor
p
2| sin κ| .
(17.22)
If we want the Hamiltonian to take the form (17.13), then, in terms of the creation
and annihilation operators (17.20) and (17.21), the Hamiltonian must be
Hop =
Z π
0
dκ
κ
2 sin κ

aL†(−κ) aL(−κ) + a†R(κ) aR(κ)

.
(17.23)
Since, in momentum space, Eqs. (17.15) and (17.16) take the form
aL(κ) = p+(κ) + (1 −e−iκ)q(κ) ,
aR(κ) = p+(κ) + (1 −eiκ)q(κ) ,
(17.24)
after some shuﬄing, we ﬁnd the Hamiltonian (ignoring the vacuum term)
Hop = 1

(17.25)
159

where |p+(κ)|2 stands for p+(κ) p+(−κ) . Since the ﬁeld redeﬁnition q(x)+ 1
2p+(x) →q(x)
does not aﬀect the commutation rules, and
lim
κ→0
κ
2 tan(1
2κ) = 1 ,
4 sin2(1
2κ)|q(κ)|2 →|(∂xq)(κ)|2 ,
(17.26)
we see that the continuum limit (17.2), (17.10) is obtained when the lattice length scale
is sent to zero.
Because of the factor (17.22), the expression (17.23) for our Hamiltonian shows that
the operators a and a† , annihilate and create energies of the amount |κ| , as usual, and
the Hamilton equations for aL,R are
d
dtaL(−κ, t) = −i[ aL(−κ, t), Hop ]
=
−i κ
2 sin κ 2 sin κ aL(−κ) = −iκ aL(−κ, t) ;
d
dtaR(κ, t)
=
−iκ aR(κ, t) .
(17.27)
Consequently,
aL(−κ, t) e−iκx = aL(−κ, 0)e−iκx−iκt ;
aR(κ, t)eiκx = aR(κ, 0)eiκx−iκt .
(17.28)
We now notice that the operators aL(x, t) = aL(x + t) and aR(x, t) = aR(x −t) move
exactly one position after one unit time step. Therefore, even on the lattice,
aL(x, 1) = aL(x + 1, 0) ,
aR(x, 1) = aR(x −1, 0) ,
etc.
(17.29)
and now we can use this to eliminate p+(x, t) and q(x, t) from these equations. Writing
p+(x, t) ≡p(x, t + 1
2) ,
(17.30)
one arrives at the equations
q(x, t + 1)
=
q(x, t) + p(x, t + 1
2) ;
(17.31)
p(x, t + 1
2)
=
p(x, t −1
2) + q(x −1, t) −2q(x, t) + q(x + 1, t) .
(17.32)
We now see why we had to shift the ﬁeld q(x, t) by half the ﬁeld momentum in Eq. (17.25):
it puts the ﬁeld at the same position t + 1
2 as the momentum variable p+(x, t) .
Thus, we end up with a quantum ﬁeld theory where not only space but also time is on
a lattice. The momentum values p(x, t + 1
2) can be viewed as variables on the time-like
links of the lattice.
At small values of κ , the Hamiltonian (17.23), (17.25) closely approaches that of the
continuum theory, and so it obeys locality conditions there. For this reason, the model
would be interesting indeed, if this is what can be matched with a cellular automaton.
However, there is a problem with it. At values of κ approaching κ →±π , the kernels
diverge. Suppose we would like to write the expression (17.23) in position space as
Hop = 1

then Ms would be obtained by Fourier transforming the coeﬃcient κ/2 sin(κ) on the
interval [−π, π] for k . The factor
1
2 comes from symmetrising the expression (17.33)
for positive and negative s . One obtains

(17.35)
Also the kernel 4κ tan 1
2κ in Eq. (17.25) diverges as κ →±π . Keeping the divergence
would make the Hamiltonian non-local, as Eq. (17.35) shows. We can’t just argue that the
largest κ values require inﬁnite energies to excite them because they do not; according
to Eq. (17.13), the energies of excitations at momentum κ are merely proportional to
κ itself. We therefore propose to make a smooth cut-oﬀ, replacing the divergent kernels
such as 4κ tan 1
2κ by expressions such as
(4κ tan 1
2κ)(1 −e−Λ2(π−κ)2) ,
(17.36)
where Λ can be taken to be arbitrarily large but not inﬁnite.
We can also say that we keep only those excitations that are orthogonal to plane waves
where aL(x) or aR(x) are of the form C(−1)x . Also these states we refer to as edge
states.
What we now have is a lattice theory where the Hamiltonian takes the form (17.13),
where N L(−κ) and N R(κ) (for positive κ ) count excitations in the left- and the right
movers, both of which move with the same speed of light at all modes. It is this system that
we can now transform to a cellular automaton. Note, that even though the lattice model
may look rather contrived, it has a smooth continuum limit, which would correspond to
a very dense automaton, and in theories of physics, it is usually only the continuum limit
that one can compare with actual observations, such as particles in ﬁeld theories. We
emphasise that, up this point, our system can be seen as a conventional quantum model.
17.1.2.
The cellular automaton with integers in 2 dimensions
The cellular automaton that will be matched with the quantum model of the previous
subsection, is a model deﬁned on a square lattice with one space dimension x and one
time coordinate t , where both x and t are restricted to be integers. The variables are
two sets of integers, one set being integer numbers Q(x, t) deﬁned on the lattice sites,
and the other being deﬁned on the links connecting the point (x, t) with (x, t+1) . These
will be called P(x, t + 1
2) , but they may sometimes be indicated as
P +(x, t) ≡P −(x, t + 1) ≡P(x, t + 1
2) .
(17.37)
161

The automaton obeys the following time evolution laws:
Q(x, t + 1)
=
Q(x, t) + P(x, t + 1
2) ;
(17.38)
P(x, t + 1
2)
=
P(x, t −1
2) + Q(x −1, t) −2Q(x, t) + Q(x + 1, t) ,
(17.39)
just analogously to Eqs. (17.31) and (17.32). It is also a discrete version of a classical
ﬁeld theory where Q(x, t) are the ﬁeld variables and P(x, t) = ∂
∂tQ(x, t) are the classical
ﬁeld momenta.
Alternatively, one can write Eq. (17.39) as
Q(x, t + 1) = Q(x −1, t) + Q(x + 1, t) −Q(x, t −1) ,
(17.40)
which, incidentally, shows that the even lattice sites evolve independently from the odd
ones. Later, this will become important.
As the reader must understand by now, Hilbert space for this system is just introduced
as a tool. The basis elements of this Hilbert space are the states
 {Q(x, 0), P +(x, 0)}
E
. If
we consider templates as superpositions of such states, we will simply deﬁne the squares of
the amplitudes to represent the probabilities. The total probability is the length-squared
of the state, which will usually be taken to be one. At this stage, superpositions mean
nothing more than this, and it is obvious that any chosen superposition, whose total length
is one, may represent a reasonable set of probabilities. The basis elements all evolve in
terms of a permutation operator that permutes the basis elements in accordance with the
evolution equations (17.38) and (17.39). As a matrix in Hilbert space, this permutation
operator only contains ones and zeros, and it is trivial to ascertain that statistical distri-
butions, written as “quantum” superpositions, evolve with the same evolution matrix.
As operators in this Hilbert space, we shall introduce shift generators that are angles,
deﬁned exactly as in Eq. (16.7), but now at each point x1 at time t = 0 , we have an
operator κ(x1) that generates an integer shift in the variable Q(x1) and an operator
ξ+(x1) generating a shift in the integer P +(x1) :
e−iκ(x1) | {Q, P +} ⟩
=
| {Q ′(x), P +(x)} ⟩;
Q ′(x) = Q(x) + δx x1 ;
(17.41)
e iξ+(x1) | {Q, P +} ⟩
=
| {Q(x), P +′(x)} ⟩;
P +′(x) = P +(x) + δx x1 ;
(17.42)
The time variable t is an integer, so what our evolution equations (17.38) and (17.39)
generate is an operator Uop (t) obeying Uop (t1 + t2) = Uop (t1) Uop (t2) , but only for
integer time steps. In section 12.2, Eq. (12.10), a Hamiltonian Hop was found that obeys
Uop (t) = e−iHop t , by Fourier analysis. The problem with that Hamiltonian is that
1. It is not unique: one may add 2π times any integer to any of its eigenvalues; and
2. It is not extensive: if two parts of a system are space-like separated, we would like
the Hamiltonian to be the sum of the two separate Hamiltonians, but then it will
quickly take values more than π , whereas, by construction, the Hamiltonian (12.10)
will obey |H| ≤π .
162

Thus, by adding appropriate multiples of real numbers to its eigenvalues, we would like
to transform our Hamiltonian into an extensive one. The question is how to do this.
Indeed, this is one of the central questions that forced us to do the investigations
described in this book; the Hamiltonian of the quantum ﬁeld theory considered here is an
extensive one, and also naturally bounded from below.
At ﬁrst sight, the similarity between the automaton described by the equations (17.38)
and (17.39), and the quantum ﬁeld theory of section (17.1.1) may seem to be superﬁcial at
best. Quantum physicists will insist that the quantum theory is fundamentally diﬀerent.
However, we claim that there is an exact mapping between the basis elements of the
quantised ﬁeld theory of subsection 17.1.1 and the states of the cellular automaton (again,
with an exception for possible edge states). We shall show this by concentrating on the
left-movers and the right-movers separately.
Our procedure will force us ﬁrst to compare the left-movers and the right-movers
separately in both theories. The automaton equations (17.38) and (17.39) ensure that, if
we start with integers at t = 0 and t = 1
2 , all entries at later times will be integers as
well. So this is a discrete automaton. We now introduce the combinations AL(x, t) and
AR(x, t) as follows (all these capital letter variables take integer values only):
AL(x, t)
=
P +(x, t) + Q(x, t) −Q(x −1, t) ;
(17.43)
AR(x, t)
=
P +(x, t) + Q(x, t) −Q(x + 1, t) ,
(17.44)
and we derive
AL(x, t + 1)
=
P +(x, t) + Q(x −1, t + 1) −2Q(x, t + 1) + Q(x −1, t + 1)
+ Q(x, t + 1) −Q(x −1, t + 1)
=
P +(x, t) + Q(x −1, t + 1) −Q(x, t + 1)
=
P +(x, t) + Q(x −1, t) + P +(x −1, t) −Q(x, t) −P +(x, t) =
P +(x −1, t) + Q(x −1, t) −Q(x, t) = AL(x −1, t) .
(17.45)
So, we have
AL(x −1, t + 1) = AL(x, t) = AL(x + t) ;
AR(x, t) = AR(x −t) ,
(17.46)
which shows that AL is a left-mover and AR is a right mover. All this is completely
analogous to Eqs. (17.15) and (17.16).
17.1.3.
The mapping between the boson theory and the automaton
The states of the quantised ﬁeld theory on the lattice were generated by the left- and
right moving operators aL(x + t) and aR(x −t) , where x and t are integers, but aL
and aR have continua of eigenvalues, and they obey the commutation rules (17.17) and
(17.18):
[aL, aR] = 0 ;
[aL(x), aL(y)] = ± i if y = x ± 1 ;
else 0 ;
(17.47)
[aR(x), aR(y)] = ∓i if y = x ± 1 ;
else 0 .
(17.48)
163

In contrast, the automaton has integer variables AL(x + t) and AR(x −t) , Eqs, (17.43)
and (17.44). They live on the same space-time lattice, but they are integers, and they
commute.
Now, PQ theory suggests what we have to do. The shift generators κ(x1) and ξ(x1)
(Eqs. 17.41 and 17.42) can be combined to deﬁne shift operators ηL(x1) and ηR(x1) for
the integers AL(x1, t) and AR(x1, t) . Deﬁne
e iηL(x1)|{AL, AR}⟩= |{AL′, AR}⟩,
AL′(x) = AL(x) + δx,x1 ,
(17.49)
e iηR(x1)|{AL, AR}⟩= |{AL, AR′}⟩,
AR′(x) = AR(x) + δx,x1 .
(17.50)
These then have to obey the following equations:
ξ(x)
=
ηL(x) + ηR(x) ;
−κ(x)
=
ηL(x) + ηR(x) −ηL(x + 1) −ηR(x −1) .
(17.51)
The ﬁrst of these tells us that, according to Eqs. (17.43) and (17.44), raising P +(x) by
one unit, while keeping all others ﬁxed, implies raising this combination of AL and AR .
The second tells us what the eﬀect is of raising only Q(x) by one unit while keeping the
others ﬁxed. Of course, the additions and subtractions in Eqs. (17.51) are modulo 2π .
Inverting Eqs. (17.51) leads to
ηL(x + 1) −ηL(x −1)
=
ξ(x) + κ(x) −ξ(x −1) ,
ηR(x −1) −ηR(x + 1)
=
ξ(x) + κ(x) −ξ(x + 1) .
(17.52)
These are diﬀerence equations whose solutions involve inﬁnite sums with a boundary
assumption.
This has no further consequences; we take the theory to be deﬁned by
the operators ηL,R(x) , not the ξ(x) and κ(x) . As we have encountered many times
before, there are some non-local modes of measure zero, ηL(x + 2n) = constant , and
ηR(x + 2n) = constant .
What we have learned from the PQ theory, is that, in a sector of Hilbert space that
is orthogonal to the edge state, an integer variable A , and its shift operator η , obey the
commutation rules
A e iη = e iη(A + 1) ;
[η, A] = i .
(17.53)
This gives us the possibility to generate operators that obey the commutation rules (17.47)
and (17.48) of the quantum ﬁeld theory:
aL(x)
?=
√
2π AL(x) −
1
√
2π ηL(x −1) ;
(17.54)
aR(x)
?=
√
2π AR(x) −
1
√
2π ηR(x + 1) .
(17.55)
The factors
√
2π are essential here.
They ensure that the spectrum is not larger or
smaller than the real line, that is, without gaps or overlaps (degeneracies).
164

The procedure can be improved. In the expressions (17.54) and (17.55), we have an
edge state whenever ηL,R take on the values ±π . This is an unwanted situation: these
edge states make all wave functions discontinuous on the points aL,R(x) =
√
2π (N(x)+ 1
2) .
Fortunately, we can cancel most of these edge states by repeating more precisely the
procedure explained in our treatment of PQ theory: these states were due to vortices
in two dimensional planes of the tori spanned by the η variables. Let us transform, by
means of standard Fourier transforming the A lattices to the η circles, so that we get a
multi-dimensional space of circles – one circle at every point x .
As in the simple PQ theory (see Eqs. (16.14) and (16.15)), we can introduce a phase
function ϕ({ηL}) and a ϕ({ηR}) , so that Eqs. (17.54) and (17.55) can be replaced with
aL(x)

2π ηR(x + 1) , (17.57)
where ϕ({η(x)}) is a phase function with the properties
ϕ({ηL(x) + 2πδx,x1}
=
ϕ({ηL(x)}) + ηL(x1 + 1) ;
(17.58)
ϕ({ηR(x) + 2πδx,x1}
=
ϕ({ηR(x)}) + ηR(x1 −1) .
(17.59)
Now, as one can easily check, the operators aL,R(x) are exactly periodic for all η variables,
just as we had in section 16.
A phase function with exactly these properties can be written down. We start with the
elementary function φ(κ, ξ) derived in section 16.2, Eq. (16.28), having the properties
φ(κ, ξ + 2π) = φ(κ, ξ) + κ ;
φ(κ + 2π, ξ) = φ(κ, ξ) ;
(17.60)
φ(κ, ξ) = −φ(−κ, ξ) = −φ(κ, −ξ) ;
φ(κ, ξ) + φ(ξ, κ) = κξ/2π .
(17.61)
The function obeying Eqs. (17.58) and (17.59) is now not diﬃcult to construct:
ϕ({ηL})
=
X
x
φ

ηL(x + 1), ηL(x)

;
ϕ({ηR})
=
X
x
φ

ηR(x −1), ηR(x)

,
(17.62)
and as was derived in section 16.2, a phase function with these properties can be given as
the phase of an elliptic function,
r(κ, ξ)eiφ(κ,ξ) ≡
∞
X
N=−∞
e−π(N−ξ
2π )2−iNκ ,
(17.63)
where r and φ are both real functions of κ and ξ .
165

We still have edge states, but now these only sit at the corners where two consecutive
η variables take the values ±π . This is where the phase function φ , and therefore also
ϕ , become singular. We suspect that we can simply ignore them.
We then reach an important conclusion. The states of the cellular automaton can
be used as a basis for the description of the quantum ﬁeld theory. These models are
equivalent. This is an astounding result. For generations we have been told by our physics
teachers, and we explained to our students, that quantum theories are fundamentally
diﬀerent from classical theories. No-one should dare to compare a simple computer model
such as a cellular automaton based on the integers, with a fully quantised ﬁeld theory.
Yet here we ﬁnd a quantum ﬁeld system and an automaton that are based on states that
neatly correspond to each other, they evolve identically. If we describe some probabilistic
distribution of possible automaton states using Hilbert space as a mathematical device,
we can use any wave function, certainly also waves in which the particles are entangled,
and yet these states evolve exactly the same way.
Physically, using 19th century logic, this should have been easy to understand: when
quantising a classical ﬁeld theory, we get energy packets that are quantised and behave
as particles, but exactly the same are generated in a cellular automaton based on the
integers; these behave as particles as well. Why shouldn’t there be a mapping?
Of course one can, and should, be skeptical. Our ﬁeld theory was not only constructed
without interactions and without masses, but also the wave function was devised in such
a way that it cannot spread, so it should not come as a surprise that no problems are
encountered with interference eﬀects, so yes, all we have is a primitive model, not very
representative for the real world. Or is this just a beginning?
Note: being exactly integrable, the model discussed in this section has inﬁnitely many
conservation laws. For instance, one may remark that the equation of motion (17.40) does
not mix even sites with odd sites of the lattice; similar equations select out sub-lattices
with x + t = 4k and x and t even, from other sub-lattices.
17.1.4.
An alternative ontological basis: the compactiﬁed model
In the above chapters and sections of this chapter, we have seen various examples of
deterministic models that can be mapped onto quantum models and back. The reader
may have noticed that, in many cases, these mappings are not unique. Modifying the
choices of the constant energy shifts δEi in the composite cogwheel model, section 2.2.2,
we saw that many apparently diﬀerent quantum theories can be mapped onto the same
set of cogwheels, although there, the δEi could have been regarded as various chemical
potentials, having no eﬀect on the evolution law. In our PQ theory, one is free to add
fractional constants to Q and P , thus modifying the mapping somewhat. Here, the
eﬀect of this would be that the ontological states obtained from one mapping do not quite
coincide with those of the other, they are superpositions, and this is an example of the
occurrence of sets of ontological states that are not equivalent, but all equally legal.
The emergence of inequivalent choices of an ontological basis is particularly evident if
the quantum system in question has symmetry groups that are larger than those of the
166

ontological system. If the ontological system is based on a lattice, it can only have some
of the discrete lattice groups as its symmetries, whereas the quantum system, based on
real coordinates, can have continuous symmetry groups such as the rotation, translation
and Lorentz group. Performing a symmetry transformation that is not a symmetry of the
ontological model then leads to a new set of ontological states (or “wave functions”) that
are superpositions of the other states. Only one of these sets will be the “real” ontological
states. For our theory, and in particular the cellular automaton interpretation, chap-
ters 5 and 21, this has no further consequences, except that it will be almost impossible
to single out the “true” ontological basis as opposed to the apparent ones, obtained after
quantum symmetry transformations.
In this subsection, we point out that even more can happen. Two (or perhaps more)
systems of ontological basis elements may exist that are entirely diﬀerent from one another.
This is the case for the model of the previous subsection, which handles the mathematics
of non-interacting massless bosons in 1 + 1 dimensions. We argued that an ontological
basis is spanned by all states where the ﬁeld q(x, t) is replaced by integers Q(x, t) . A
lattice in x, t was introduced, but this was a temporary lattice; we could send the mesh
size to zero in the end.
In subsection 17.1.2, we introduced the integers AL(x) and AR(x) , which are the
integer-valued left movers and right movers; they span an ontological basis. Equivalently,
one could have taken the integers Q(x, t) and P +(x, t) at a given time t , but this is just
a reformulation of the same ontological system.
But why not take the continuous degrees of freedom ηL(x) and ηR(x) (or equivalently,
ξ(x, t) and κ(x, t) )? At each x , these variables take values between −π and π . Since
they are also left- and right movers, their evolution law is exactly as deterministic as that
of the integers AL and AR :
∂
∂tηL(x, t) = ∂
∂xηL(x, t) ,
∂
∂tηR(x, t) = −∂
∂xηR(x, t) ,
(17.64)
while all η ’s commute.
Actually, for the η ﬁelds, it is much easier now to regard the continuum limit for
the space–time lattice. The quantum operators aL,R are still given by Eqs, (17.56) and
(17.57). There is a singularity when two consecutive η ﬁelds take the values ±π , but if
they don’t take such values at t = t0 , they never reach those points at other times.
There exists a somewhat superior way to rephrase the mapping by making use of the
fact that the η ﬁelds are continuous, so that we can do away with, or hide, the lattice.
This is shown in more detail in subsection 17.3.5, where these ideas are applied in string
theory.
What we conclude from this subsection is that both our quantum model of bosons and
the model of left and right moving integers are mathematically equivalent to a classical
theory of scalar ﬁelds where the values are only deﬁned modulo 2π . From the ontological
point of view, this new model is entirely diﬀerent from both previous models.
Because the variables of the classical model only take values on the circle, we call the
classical model a compactiﬁed classical ﬁeld theory. At other places in this book, the
167

author warned that classical, continuous theories may not be the best ontological systems
to assume for describing Nature, because they tend to be chaotic: as time continues,
more and more decimal places of the real numbers describing the initial state will become
relevant, and this appears to involve unbounded sets of digital data.
To our present
continuous ﬁeld theory in 1 + 1 dimensions, this objection does not apply, because there
is no chaos; the theory is entirely integrable. Of course, in more complete models of
the real world we do not expect integrability, so there this objection against continuum
models does apply.
17.1.5.
The quantum ground state
Nevertheless, the mappings we found are delicate ones, and not always easy to implement.
For instance, one would like to ask which solution of the cellular automaton, or the
compactiﬁed ﬁeld theory, corresponds to the quantum ground state of the quantised ﬁeld
theory. First, we answer the question: if you have the ground state, how do we add a
single particle to it?
Now this should be easy. We have the creation and annihilation operators for left
movers and right movers, which are the Fourier transforms of the operators aL,R(x) of
Eqs. (17.56) and (17.57).
When the Fourier parameter, the lattice momentum κ , is
in the interval −π < κ < 0 , then aL(κ) is an annihilation operator and aR(κ) is a
creation operator. When 0 < κ < π , this is the other way around. Since nothing can be
annihilated from the vacuum state, the annihilation operators vanish, so aL,R(x) acting
on the vacuum can only give a superposition of one–particle states.
To see how a single left-moving particle is added to a classical cellular automaton
state, we consider the expression (17.56) for aL(x) , acting on the left-mover’s coordinate
x + t →x when t = 0 . The operator ∂/∂ηL(x) multiplies the amplitude for the state
with iAL(x) ; the other operators in Eq. (17.56) are just functions of ηL at the point x
and the point x −1 . Fourier transforming these functions gives us the operators e±NiηL
multiplied with the Fourier coeﬃcients found, acting on our original state. According to
Eq. (17.49), this means that, at the two locations x and x −1 , we add or subtract N
units to the number AL there, and then we multiply the new state with the appropriate
Fourier coeﬃcient. Since the functions in question are bounded, we expect the Fourier
expansion to converge reasonably well, so we can regard the above as being a reasonable
answer to the question how to add a particle. Of course, our explicit construction added
a particle at the point x . Fourier transforming it, gives us a particle with momentum
−κ and energy κ .
In the compactiﬁed ﬁeld model, the action of the operators (17.56) and (17.57) is
straightforward; we ﬁnd the states with one or more particles added, provided that the
wave function is diﬀerentiable. The ontological wave functions are not diﬀerentiable – they
are delta peaks, so particles can only be added as templates, which are to be regarded as
probabilistic distributions of ontological states.
Finding the vacuum state, i.e. the quantum ground state itself, is harder. It is that
particular superposition of ontological states from which no particles can be removed.
168

Selecting out the annihilation parts of the operators aL,R(x) means that we have to
apply the projection operator P−on the function aL(x) and P+ on aR(x) , where the
projection operators P± are given by
P±a(x) =
X
x′
P±(x −x′)a(x′) ,
(17.65)
where the functions P ±(y) are deﬁned by
P±(y)
=
1
2π
Z π
0
dκ e±iyκ = ±i
πy
if y odd ,
1
2δy,0 if y even .
(17.66)
The state for which the operators P+aL(x) and P−aR(x) vanish at all x is the
quantum ground state. It is a superposition of all cellular automaton states.
Note that the theory has a Goldstone mode [14], which means that an excitation in
which all ﬁelds q(x, t) , or all automaton variables Q(x, t) , get the same constant Q0
added to them, does not aﬀect the total energy. This is an artefact of this particular
model41.
Note also that the projection operators P±(x) are not well-deﬁned on x -
independent ﬁelds; for these ﬁelds, the vacuum is ill-deﬁned.
17.2.
Bosonic theories in higher dimensions?
At ﬁrst sight, it seems that the model described in previous sections may perhaps be
generalised to higher dimensions. In this section, we begin with setting up a scheme that
should serve as an approach towards handling bosons in a multiply dimensional space as a
cellular automaton. Right-away, we emphasise that a mapping in the same spirit as what
was achieved in previous sections and chapters will not be achieved. Nevertheless, we
will exhibit here the initial mathematical steps, which start out as deceptively beautiful.
Then, we will exhibit, with as much clarity as we can, what, in this case, the obstacles
are, and why we call this a failure in the end. As it seems today, what we have here is a
loose end, but it could also be the beginning of a theory where, as yet, we were forced to
stop half-way.
17.2.1.
Instability
We would have been happy with either a discretised automaton or a compactiﬁed classical
ﬁeld theory, and for the time being, we keep both options open.
Take the number of space-like dimensions to be d , and suppose that we replace
Eqs. (17.38) and (17.39) by
Q(⃗x, t + 1)
=
Q(⃗x, t) + P(⃗x, t + 1

this theorem [26], however, only applies when there are interactions. Ours is a free particle model.
169

where ˆei are unit vectors in the i th direction in space.
Next, consider a given time t . We will need to localise operators in time, and can
do this only by choosing the time at which an operator acts such that, at that particular
time, the eﬀect of the operator is as concise as is possible. This was why, for the P
operators, in Eqs. (17.67) and (17.68), we chose to indicate time as t ± 1
2 (where t is
integer). Let κop (⃗x, t + 1
2) be the generator of a shift of Q(⃗x, t) and the same shift
in Q(⃗x, t + 1) (so that P(⃗x, t + 1
2) does not shift), while ξop (⃗x, t) generates identical,
negative shifts of P(⃗x, t + 1
2) and of P(⃗x, t −1
2) , without shifting Q(⃗x, t) at the same
t , and with the signs both as dictated in Eqs (17.41) and (17.42). Surprisingly, one ﬁnds
that these operators obey the same equations (17.67) and (17.68): the operation
κop (⃗x, t + 1
2)
has the same eﬀect as
κop (⃗x, t + 3

and ξop (⃗x, t)
has the same eﬀect as
ξop (⃗x, t + 1) −κop (⃗x, t + 1
2)
(17.69)
(where the sum is the same as in Eq. (17.68) but in a more compact notation) and
therefore,
ξop (⃗x, t + 1)
=
ξop (⃗x, t) + κop (⃗x, t + 1

(17.71)
and, noting that Q and P are integers, while κop and ξop are conﬁned to the inter-
val [0, 2π) , we conclude that again the same equations are obeyed by the real number
operators
qop (⃗x, t)
?=
Q(⃗x, t) +

2πξop (⃗x, t) ,
and
pop (⃗x, t + 1
2)
?=
2πP(⃗x, t + 1
2) + κop (⃗x, t + 1
2) .
(17.72)
These operators, however, do not obey the correct commutation rules. There even
appears to be a factor 2 wrong, if we would insert the equations [Q(⃗x), κop (⃗x′)] ?= iδ⃗x,⃗x′ ,
[ξop (⃗x), P(⃗x′)] ?= iδ⃗x,⃗x′ . Of course, the reason for this failure is that we have the edge
states, and we have not yet restored the correct boundary conditions in ξ, κ space by
inserting the phase factors ϕ , as in Eqs. (17.56), (17.57), or φ in (16.14), (16.15). This
is where our diﬃculties begin. These phase factors also aught to obey the correct ﬁeld
equations, and this seems to be impossible to realise.
In fact, there is an other diﬃculty with the equations of motion, (17.67), (17.68):
they are unstable. It is true that, in the continuum limit, these equations generate the
170

usual ﬁeld equations for smooth functions q(⃗x, t) and p(⃗x, t) , but we now have lattice
equations. Fourier transforming the equations in the space variables ⃗x and time t , one
ﬁnds
−2i(sin 1

p(⃗k, ω) ,

This gives the dispersion relation

2(1 −cos ki) .
(17.74)
In one space-like dimension, this just means that ω = ±k , which would be ﬁne, but if
d > 1 , and ki take on values close to ±π , the r.h.s. of this equation exceeds the limit
value 4, the cosine becomes an hyperbolic cosine, and thus we ﬁnd modes that oscillate
out of control, exponentially with time.
To mitigate this problem, we would somehow have to constrain the momenta ki to-
wards small values only, but, both in a cellular automation where all variables are integers,
and in the compactiﬁed ﬁeld model, where we will need to respect the intervals (−π, π) ,
this is hard to accomplish. Note that we used Fourier transforms on functions such as
Q and P in Eqs. (17.67) and (17.68) that take integer values. In itself, that procedure
is ﬁne, but it shows the existence of exponentially exploding solutions. These solutions
can also be attributed to the non-existence of an energy function that is conserved and
bounded from below. Such an energy function does exist in one dimension:

(17.76)
Up to a factor sin k / k , this is the Hamiltonian (17.25) (Since the equations of motion
at diﬀerent k values are independent, conservation of one of these Hamiltonians implies
conservation of the other).
In higher dimensions, models of this sort cannot have a non-negative, conserved energy
function, and so these will be unstable.
17.2.2.
Abstract formalism for the multidimensional harmonic oscillator
Our PQ procedure for coupled harmonic oscillators can be formalised more succinctly
and elegantly.
Let us write a time-reversible harmonic model with integer degrees of
freedom as follows. In stead of Eqs. (17.67) and (17.68) we write
171

Qi(t + 1)
=
Qi(t) +
X
j
TijPj(t + 1
2) ;
(17.77)
Pi(t + 1
2)
=
Pi(t −1
2) −
X
j
VijQj(t) .
(17.78)
Here, t is an integer-valued time variable. It is very important that both matrices T and
V are real and symmetric:
Tij = Tji ;
Vij = Vji .
(17.79)
Tij would often, but not always, be taken to be the Kronecker delta δij , and Vij would
be the second derivative of a potential function, here being constant coeﬃcients. Since we
want Qi and Pi both to remain integer-valued, the coeﬃcients Tij and Vij will also be
taken to be integer-valued. In principle, any integer-valued matrix would do; in practice,
we will ﬁnd severe restrictions.
Henceforth, we shall omit the summation symbol P
j , as its presence can be taken to
be implied by summation convention: every repeated index is summed over.
When we deﬁne the translation generators for Qi and Pi , we ﬁnd that, in a Heisenberg
picture, it is best to use an operator κop
i (t + 1
2) to add one unit to Qi(t) while all other
integers Qj(t) with j ̸= i and all Pj(t + 1
2) are kept ﬁxed. Note that, according to the
evolution equation (17.77), this also adds one unit to Qi(t + 1) while all other Qj(t + 1)
are kept ﬁxed as well, so that we have symmetry around the time value t + 1
2 . Similarly,
we deﬁne an operator ξop
i (t) that shifts the value of both Pi(t −1
2) and Pi(t + 1
2) , while
all other Q and P operators at t −1
2 and at t + 1
2 are kept unaﬀected; all this was also
explained in the text between Eqs. (17.68) and (17.69).
So, we deﬁne the action by operators κop
i
and ξop
i
by
e−iκop
i
(t+ 1
2 )|{Qj(t), Pj(t + 1
2)}⟩

2 )|{Qj(t + 1), Pj(t + 1
2)}⟩
=
|{Q′
j(t + 1), Pj(t + 1
2)}⟩
with
(17.80)
Q′
j(t) = Qj(t) + δji ,
Q′
j(t + 1) = qj(t + 1) + δji ;

(t)|{Qj(t), Pj(t −1

j(t −1
2)}⟩
with
(17.81)
P ′
j(t ± 1
2) = Pj(t ± 1
2) + δji .
The operators ξop
i (t) and κop
i (t + 1
2) then obey exactly the same equations as Qi(t)
and Pi(t + 1
2) , as given in Eqs (17.77) and (17.78):

i (t + 1)

Note that H1 contains a pure square of the Q ﬁelds but a mixed product of the P ﬁelds
while H2 has that the other way around. It is not diﬃcult to check that H1(t) = H2(t+ 1
2) :
H2 −H1 = −1
2Tij Pi(t + 1
2) Vjk Qk(t) + 1
2Vij Qi(t) Tjk Pk(t + 1
2) = 0 .
(17.86)
Similarly, we ﬁnd that the Hamiltonian stays the same at all times. Thus, we have a
conserved energy, and that could guarantee stability of the evolution equations.
However, we still need to check whether this energy function is indeed non-negative.
This we do by rewriting it as the sum of two squares. In H1 , we write the momentum
part (kinetic energy) as
1
2Tij

Pi(t + 1
2) + 1
2Vik Qk(t)

Pj(t + 1
2) + 1
2VjℓQℓ(t)

−1
8TijVik VjℓQk(t) Qℓ(t)
,
(17.87)
so that we get at integer times (in short-hand notation)
H1 = ⃗Q(1
2V −1
8V T V )⃗Q + 1
2(⃗P + + 1
2 ⃗Q V ) T (⃗P + + 1
2V ⃗Q) ,
(17.88)
and at half-odd integer times:
H2 = ⃗P(1
2T −1
8T V T)⃗P + 1
2(⃗Q−+ 1
2 ⃗P T) V (⃗Q−+ 1
2T ⃗P) ,
(17.89)
where P +(t) stands for P(t + 1
2) , and Q−(t + 1
2) stands for Q(t) .
The expression (17.85) for H2 was the one used in Eq. (17.75) above. It was turned
into Eq. (17.89) in the next expression, Eq. (17.76).
Stability now requires that the coeﬃcients for these squares are all non-negative. This
has to be checked for the ﬁrst term in Eq. (17.88) and in (17.89). If V and/or T have
one or several vanishing eigenvectors, this does not seem to generate real problems, and
we replace these by inﬁnitesimal numbers ε > 0 . Then, we ﬁnd that, on the one hand
one must demand
⟨T ⟩> 0 ,
⟨V ⟩> 0 ;
(17.90)
while on the other had, by multiplying left and right by V −1 and T −1 :
⟨4V −1 −T ⟩≥0 ,
⟨4T −1 −V ⟩≥0 .
(17.91)
173

Unfortunately, there are not so many integer-valued matrices V and T with these
properties. Limiting ourselves momentarily to the case Tij = δij , we ﬁnd that the matrix
Vij can have at most a series of 2’s on its diagonal and sequences of ±1 ’s on both sides
of the diagonal. Or, the model displayed above in Eq. (17.67) and (17.68), on a lattice
with periodicity N , is the most general multi-oscillator model that can be kept stable by
a nonnegative energy function.
If we want more general, less trivial models, we have to search for a more advanced
discrete Hamiltonian formalism (see Sect. 19).
If it were not for this stability problem, we could have continued to construct real-
valued operators qop
i
and pop
i
by combining Qi with ξop
i
and Pi with κop
i
.
The
operators eiQξop
i
and e−iPκop
i
give us the states |{Qi, Pi}⟩from the ‘zero-state’ |{0, 0}⟩.
This means that only one wave function remains to be calculated by some other means,
after which all functions can be mapped by using the operators eiaipi and eibjqj . But
since we cannot obtain stable models in more than 1 space-dimensions, this procedure
is as yet of limited value. It so happens, however, that the one-dimensional model is
yet going to play a very important role in this work: (super) string theory, see the next
section.
17.3.
(Super)strings
So-far, most of our models represented non-interacting massless particles in a limited
number of space dimensions. Readers who are still convinced that quantum mechanical
systems will never be explained in terms of classical underlying models, will not be shocked
by what they have read until now. After all, one cannot do Gedanken experiments with
particles that do not interact, and anyway, massless particles in one spacial dimension
do not exhibit any dispersion, so here especially, interference experiments would be diﬃ-
cult to imagine. This next chapter however might make him/her frown a bit: we argue
that the bulk region of the (super)string equations can be mapped onto a deterministic,
ontological theory. The reason for this can be traced to the fact that string theory, in a
ﬂat background, is essentially just a one-space, one-time massless quantum ﬁeld theory,
without interactions, exactly as was described in previous sections.
As yet, however, our (super)strings will not interact, so the string solutions will act
as non-interacting particles; for theories with interactions, go to chapters 9, 19, and 21.
Superstring theory started oﬀas an apparently rather esoteric and formal approach
to the question of unifying the gravitational force with other forces. The starting point
was a dynamical system of relativistic string-like objects, subject to the rules of quantum
mechanics. As the earliest versions of these models were beset by anomalies, they appeared
to violate Lorentz invariance, and also featured excitation modes with negative mass-
squared, referred to as “tachyons”. These tachyons would have seriously destabilised the
vacuum and for that reason had to be disposed of. It turned out however, that by carefully
choosing the total number of transverse string modes, or, the dimensions of the space-
time occupied by these strings, and then by carefully choosing the value of the intercept
a(0) , which ﬁxes the mass spectrum of the excitations, and ﬁnally by imposing symmetry
174

constraints on the spectrum as well, one could make the tachyons disappear and repair
Lorentz invariance [39][49]. It was then found that, while most excitation modes of the
string would describe objects whose rest mass would be close to the Planck scale, a very
speciﬁc set of excitation modes would be massless or nearly massless. It is these modes
that are now identiﬁed as the set of fundamental particles of the Standard Model, together
with possible extensions of the Standard Model at mass scales that are too large for being
detected in today’s laboratory experiments, yet small compared to the Planck mass.
A string is a structure that is described by a sheet wiped out in space-time, the string
‘world sheet’. The sheet requires two coordinates that describe it, usually called σ and
τ . The coordinates occupied in an n = d + 1 dimensional space-time, temporarily taken
to be ﬂat Minkowski space-time, are described by the symbols42 Xµ(σ, τ), µ = 0, 1, · · · d .
Precise mathematical descriptions of a classical relativistic string and its quantum
counterpart are given in several excellent text books [39][49], and they will not be re-
peated here, but we give a brief summary. We emphasise, and we shall repeat doing so,
that our description of a superstring will not deviate from the standard picture, when
discussing the fully quantised theory. We do restrict ourselves to standard perturbative
string theory, which means that we begin with a simply connected piece of world sheet,
while topologically non-trivial conﬁgurations occur at higher orders of the string coupling
constant gs . We restrict ourselves to the case gs = 0 .
Also, we do have to restrict ourselves to a ﬂat Minkowski background. These may
well be important restrictions, but we do have speculations concerning the back reaction
of strings on their background; the graviton mode, after all, is as dictated in the stan-
dard theory, and these gravitons do represent inﬁnitesimal curvatures in the background.
Strings in black hole or (anti)-de Sitter backgrounds are as yet beyond what we can do.
17.3.1.
String basics
An inﬁnitesimal segment dℓof the string at ﬁxed time, multiplied by an inﬁnitesimal time
segment dt , deﬁnes an inﬁnitesimal surface element dΣ = dℓ∧dt . A Lorentz invariant
description of dΣ is
dΣµν = ∂Xµ
∂σ
∂Xν
∂τ
−∂Xν
∂σ
∂Xµ
∂τ
.
(17.92)
Its absolute value dΣ is then given by
± dΣ2 = 1
2ΣµνdΣµν = (∂σXµ)2(∂τXν)2 −(∂σXµ∂τXµ)2 ,
(17.93)
where the sign distinguishes space-like surfaces (+) from time-like ones (−) . The string
world sheet is supposed to be time-like.
The string evolution equations are obtained by ﬁnding the extremes of the Nambu
Goto action,
S = −T
Z
dΣ = −T
Z
dσdτ
p
(∂σXµ∂τXµ)2 −(∂σXµ)2(∂τXν)2 ,
(17.94)
42To stay in line with most literature on string theory, we chose here capital Xµ to denote the (real)
space-time coordinates. Later, these will be speciﬁed either to be real, or to be integers.
175

where T is the string tension constant; T = 1/(2πα′) .
The light cone gauge is deﬁned to be the coordinate frame (σ, τ) on the string world
sheet where the curves σ = const. and the curves τ = const. both represent light rays
conﬁned to the world sheet. More precisely:
(∂σXµ)2 = (∂τXµ)2 = 0 .
(17.95)
In this gauge, the Nambu-Goto action takes the simple form
S = T (∂σXµ)(∂τXµ)
(17.96)
(the sign being chosen such that if σ and τ are both pointing in the positive time
direction, and our metric is (−, +, +, +) ), the action is negative. Imposing both light
cone conditions (17.95) is important to ensure that also the inﬁnitesimal variations of the
action (17.96) yield the same equations as the variations of (17.94). They give:
∂σ∂τ Xµ = 0 ,
(17.97)
but we must remember that these solutions must always be subject to the non-linear
constraint equations (17.95) as well.
The solutions to these equations are left- and right movers:
Xµ(σ, τ) = Xµ
L(σ) + Xµ
R(τ) ;
(∂σXµ
L)2 = 0 ,
(∂τXµ
R)2 = 0
(17.98)
(indeed, one might decide here to rename the coordinates σ = σ+ and τ = σ−). We
now will leave the boundary conditions of the string free, while concentrating on the bulk
properties.
The re-parametrisation invariance on the world sheet has not yet been removed com-
pletely by the gauge conditions (17.95), since we can still transform
σ →˜σ(σ) ;
τ →˜τ(τ) .
(17.99)
The σ and τ coordinates are usually ﬁxed by using one of the space-time variables; one
can choose
X± = (X0 ± Xd)/
√
2 ,
(17.100)
to deﬁne
σ = σ+ = X+
L ,
τ = σ−= X+
R .
(17.101)
Substituting this in the gauge condition (17.95), one ﬁnds:
∂σX+
L ∂σX−
L
=
∂σX−
L =
1

d−1
X
i=1

R =

(17.103)
176

So, the longitudinal variables X± , or, X0 and Xd are both ﬁxed in terms of the d−1 =
n −2 transverse variables Xi(σ, τ) .
The boundary conditions for an open string are then
Xµ
L(σ + ℓ) = Xµ
L(σ) + uµ ,
Xµ
R(σ) = Xµ
L(σ) ,
(17.104)
while for a closed string,
Xµ
L(σ + ℓ) = Xµ
L(σ) + uµ
Xµ
R(τ + ℓ) = Xµ
R(τ) + uµ ,
(17.105)
where ℓand uµ are constants. uµ is the 4-velocity. One often takes ℓto be ﬁxed, like
2π , but it may be instructive to see how things depend on this free world-sheet coordinate
parameter ℓ. One ﬁnds that, for an open string, the action over one period is43
Sopen = 1
2T
Z ℓ
0
dσ
Z ℓ
0
dτ ∂σXµ ∂τXµ = 1
2Tu2 .
(17.106)
For a particle, the action is S = pµuµ , and from that, one derives that the open string’s
momentum is
pµ
open = 1
2T uµ .
(17.107)
For a closed string, the action over one period is
Sclosed = T
Z ℓ
0
dσ
Z ℓ
0
dτ ∂σXµ ∂τXµ = Tu2 ,
(17.108)
and we derive that the closed string’s momentum is
pµ
closed = T uµ .
(17.109)
Note that the length ℓof the period of the two world sheet parameters does not enter
in the ﬁnal expressions. This is because we have invariance under re-parametrisation of
these world sheet coordinates.
Now, in a ﬂat background, the quantisation is obtained by ﬁrst looking at the indepen-
dent variables. These are the transverse components of the ﬁelds, being Xi(σ, τ) , with
i = 1, 2, · · · , d −1 . This means that these components are promoted to being quantum
operators. Everything is exactly as in section 17.1. Xi
L are the left movers, Xµ
R are the
right movers. One subsequently postulates that X+(σ, τ) is given by the gauge ﬁxing
equation (17.101), or
X+
L (σ) = σ ,
X+
R(τ) = τ ,
(17.110)
while ﬁnally the coordinate X−(σ, τ) is given by the constraint equations (17.102) and
(17.103).
43The factor
1/2 originates from the fact that, over one period, only half the given domain is covered.
Do note, however, that the string’s orientation is reversed after one period.
177

The theory obtained this way is manifestly invariant under rotations among the trans-
verse degrees of freedom, Xi(σ, τ) in coordinate space, forming the space-like group
SO(d −1) . To see that it is also invariant under other space-like rotations, involving the
d th direction, and Lorentz boosts, is less straightforward. To see what happens, one has to
work out the complete operator algebra of all ﬁelds Xµ , the generators of a Lorentz trans-
formation, and ﬁnally their commutation algebra. After a lengthy but straightforward
calculation, one obtains the result that the theory is indeed Lorentz invariant provided
that certain conditions are met:
- the sequences J = a(s) of string excited modes (“Regge trajectories”) must show
an intercept a(0) that must be limited to the value a(0) = 1 (for open strings),
and
- the number of transverse dimensions must be 24 (for a bosonic string) or 8 (for a
superstring), so that d = 25 or 9 , and the total number of space-time dimensions
D is 26 or 10.
So, one then ends up with a completely Lorentz invariant theory. It is this theory that
we will study, and compare with a deterministic system. As stated at the beginning of
this section, many more aspects of this quantised relativistic string theory can be found
in the literature.
The operators X+(σ, τ) and X−(σ, τ) are needed to prove Lorentz invariance, and,
in principle, they play no role in the dynamical properties of the transverse variables
Xi(σ, τ) . It is the quantum states of the theory of the transverse modes that we plan
to compare with classical states in a deterministic theory. At the end, however, we will
need X+ and X−as well. Of these, X+ can be regarded as the independent target time
variable for the theory, without any further dynamical properties, but then X−(σ, τ) may
well give us trouble. It is not an independent variable, so it does not aﬀect our states, but
this variable does control where in space-time our string is. We return to this question in
subsection 17.3.5.
17.3.2.
Strings on a lattice
To relate this theory to a deterministic system [93], one more step is needed: the world
sheet must be put on a lattice [41], as we saw in section 17.1.1. How big or how small
should we choose the meshes to be? It will be wise to choose these meshes small enough.
Later, we will see how small; most importantly, most of our results will turn out to be
totally independent of the mesh size aworldsheet . This is because the dispersion properties
of the Hamiltonian (17.25) have been deliberately chosen in such a way that the lattice
artefacts disappear there: the left- and right movers always go with the local speed of
light. Moreover, since we have re-parametrisation invariance on the world sheet, in stead
of sending aworldsheet to zero, we could decide to send ℓto inﬁnity. This way, we can
keep aworldsheet = 1 throughout the rest of the procedure. Remember that, the quantity
ℓdid not enter in our ﬁnal expressions for the physical properties of the string, not even
178

if they obey boundary conditions ensuring that we talk of open or closed strings. Thus,
the physical limit will be the limit ℓ→∞, for open and for closed strings.
We now proceed as in sections 17.1.1 and 17.1.2. Assuming that the coordinates x
and t used there, are related to σ and τ by44
σ =
1
√
2(x + t) ,
τ =
1
√
2(t −x) ;
x =

√
2(σ −τ) ,
t =

√
2(σ + τ) ,
(17.111)
we ﬁnd that the Nambu Goto action (17.96) amounts to d −1 copies of the two-
dimensional action obtained by integrating the Lagrangian (17.2):
L =
d−1
X
i−1
∂σXi ∂τXi ,
(17.112)
provided the string constant T is normalised to one. (Since all d + 1 modes of the string
evolve independently as soon as the on shell constraints (17.101) — (17.103) are obeyed,
and we are now only interested in the transverse modes, we may here safely omit the 2
longitudinal modes).
If our units are chosen such that T = 1 , so that α′ = 1/2π , we can use the lattice
rules (17.43) and (17.44), for the transverse modes, or
Xi
L(x, t)
=
pi(x, t) + Xi(x, t) −Xi(x −1, t) ;
(17.113)
Xi
R(x, t)
=
pi(x, t) + Xi(x, t) −Xi(x + 1, t) .
(17.114)
where P i(x, t) = ∂tXi(x, t) (cf Eqs. (17.15) and (17.16), or (17.43) and (17.44)). Since
these obey the commutation rules (17.17) and (17.18), or
[Xi
L, Xj
R] = 0 ;
[Xi
L(x), Xj
L(y)] = ± i δij if y = x ± 1 ,
else 0 ,
(17.115)
[Xi
R(x), Xj
R(y)] = ∓i δij if y = x ± 1 ,
else 0 ,
(17.116)
we can write these operators in terms of integer-valued operators Ai
L,R(x) and their
associated shift generators ηi
L,R , as in Eqs. (17.56) and (17.57). There, the η basis was
used, so that the integer operators Ai
L,R are to be written as −i∂/∂ηi
L,R . To make an
important point, let us, momentarily, replace the coeﬃcients there by α, β, and γ :

(17.117)
and similarly for Xi
R ; here ϕ({η(x)}) is the phase function introduced in Eqs. (17.58)
and (17.59).
What ﬁxes the coeﬃcients α, β and γ in these expressions? First, we must have the
right commutation relations (17.115) and (17.116). This ﬁxes the product α γ = 1 . Next,
we insist that the operators Xi
L are periodic in all variables ηi
L(x) . This was why the
44With apologies for a somewhat inconsistent treatment of the sign of time variables for the right-
movers; we preferred to have τ go in the +t direction while keeping the notation of section 17.1 for left-
and right movers on the world sheet.
179

phase function ϕ({η}) was introduced. It itself is pseudo periodic, see Eq. (17.58). Exact
periodicity of Xi
L requires β = 2πγ . Finally, and this is very important, we demand that
the spectrum of values of the operators X−
L,R runs smoothly from −∞to ∞without
overlaps or gaps; this ﬁxes the ratios of the coeﬃcients α and γ : we have α = 2πγ .
Thus, we retrieve the coeﬃcients:
α = β =
√
2π ;
γ = 1/
√
2π .
(17.118)
The reason why we emphasise the ﬁxed values of these coeﬃcients is that we have to
conclude that, in our units, the coordinate functions Xi
L,R(x, t) of the cellular automaton
are
√
2π times some integers. In our units, T = 1/(2πα′) = 1 ; α′ = 1/(2π) . In arbitrary
length units, one gets that the variables Xi
L,R are integer multiples of a space-time lattice
mesh length aspacetime , with
aspacetime =
p
2π/T = 2π
√
α′ .
(17.119)
In Figure 14, the spectrum of the allowed string target space coordinates in the quantum
theory is sketched. Only if Eq. (17.119) is exactly obeyed, the classical system exactly
matches the quantum theory, otherwise false voids or overlappings appear45.

The squares, representing the ranges of the η parameters, were rounded a bit so as
to show the location of passible edge states.
What we ﬁnd is that our classical string lives on a square lattice with mesh size
aspacetime . According to the theory explained in the last few sections of this chapter, the
fully quantised bosonic string is entirely equivalent to this classical string; there is a dual
mapping between the two. The condition (17.119) on the value of the lattice parameter
aspacetime is essential for this mapping. If string theoreticians can be persuaded to limit

would emerge, a situation that can perhaps be accounted for in superstring theory.

themselves to string coordinates that live on this lattice, they will see that the complete
set of quantum states of the bosonic string still spans the entire Hilbert space they are
used to, while now all basis elements of this Hilbert space propagate classically, according
to the discrete analogues of the classical string equations.
Intuitively, in the above, we embraced the lattice theory as the natural ontological
system corresponding to a non-interacting string theory in Minkowski space. However, in
principle, we could just as well have chosen the compactiﬁed theory. This theory would
assert that the transverse degrees of freedom of the string do not live on R d−1 , but on
T d−1 , a (continuous) torus in d −1 dimensions, again with periodicity conditions over
lengths 2π
√
α′ , and these degrees of freedom would move about classically.
In subsection 17.3.5 we elaborate further on the nature of the deterministic string
versions.
17.3.3.
The lowest string excitations
String theory is a quantum ﬁeld theory on the 1 + 1 dimensional world sheet of the
string. If this quantum ﬁeld theory is in its ground state, the corresponding string mode
describes the lightest possible particle in this theory. As soon as we put excited states
in the world sheet theory, the string goes into excited states, which means that we are
describing heavier particles. This way, one describes the mass- or energy spectrum of the
string.
In the original versions of the theory, the lightest particle turned out to have a negative
mass squared; it would behave as a tachyon, which would be an unwanted feature of a
theory.
The more sophisticated, modern versions of the theory are rearranged in such a way
that the tachyon mode can be declared to be unphysical, but it still acts as a description
of the formal string vacuum. To get the string spectrum, one starts with this unphysical
tachyon state and then creates descriptions of the other states by considering the action
of creation operators.
To relate these string modes to the ontological states at the deterministic, classical
sides of our mapping equation, we again consider the ground state, as it was described in
subsection 17.1.5, to describe the tachyon solution. Thus, the same procedure as in that
subsection will have to be applied. Similarly one can get the physical particles by having
the various creation operators act on the tachyon (ground) state. This way, we get our
description of the photon (the ﬁrst spin one state of the open string) and the graviton
(the spin 2 excited state of the closed string).
17.3.4.
The Superstring
To construct theories containing fermions, it was proposed to plant fermionic degrees of
freedom on the string world sheet. Again, anomalies were encountered, unless the bosonic
and fermionic degrees of freedom can be united to form super multiplets. Each bosonic
coordinate degree of freedom Xµ(σ, τ) would have to be associated with a fermionic degree
181

of freedom ψµ(σ, τ) . This should be done for the left-moving modes independently of the
right-moving ones. A further twist can be given to the theory by only adding fermionic
modes to the left-movers, not to the right movers (or vice versa); this way, chirality can be
introduced in string theory, not unlike the chirality that is clearly present in the Standard
Model. Such a theory is called a heterotic string theory.
Since the world sheet is strictly two-dimensional, we have no problems with spin and
helicity within the world sheet, so, here, the quantisation of fermionic ﬁelds — at least at
the level of the world sheet — is simpler than in the case of the ‘neutrinos’ discussed in
subsection 15.2.3.
Earlier, we used the coordinates σ and τ as light cone coordinates on the world sheet;
now, temporarily, we want to use there a space-like coordinate and a time-like one, which
we shall call x1 = x and x0 = t .
On the world sheet, spinors are 2-dimensional rather than 4-dimensional, and we take
them to be hermitean operators, called Majorana ﬁelds, which we write as
ψµ∗(x, t) = ψµ(x, t) ,
and
ψµ†(x, t) = ψµ ∗T(x, t)
(17.120)
(assuming a real Minkowskian target space; the superscripts ∗T mean that if ψ = (ψ1
ψ2)
then ψ∗T = (ψ∗
1, ψ∗
2) ).
There are only two Dirac matrices, call them ϱ0 and ϱ1 , or, after a Wick rotation,
ϱ1 and ϱ2 . They obey
ϱ0 = iϱ2 ,
{ϱα, ϱβ} = ϱαϱβ + ϱβϱα = 2ηαβ ,

(17.124)
Since the ϱ2 is antisymmetric and fermion ﬁelds anti-commute, two diﬀerent spinors
ψ and χ obey
χψ = χTϱ2ψ = i(−χ1ψ2 + χ2ψ1) = i(ψ2χ1 −ψ1χ2) = ψTϱ2χ = ψχ .
(17.125)
Also we have
χϱµψ = −ψϱµχ ,
(17.126)

an antisymmetry that explains why the Lagrangian (17.124) is not a pure derivative. The
Dirac equation on the string world sheet is found to be

(17.127)
In the world sheet light cone frame, one writes

where, in the representation (17.122),

(17.131)
Thus, one ﬁnds that the fermionic left-movers and right-movers have no further spinor
indices.
As is the case for the bosonic coordinate ﬁelds Xµ
L,R(x) , also the fermionic ﬁeld com-
ponents ψµ
L,R have two longitudinal modes, µ = ± , that are determined by constraint
equations. These equations are dictated by supersymmetry. So for the fermions also, we
only keep the d −1 transverse components as independent dynamical ﬁelds ( d is the
number of space-like dimensions in target space).
The second-quantised theory for such fermionic ﬁelds has already brieﬂy been discussed
in our treatment of the second-quantised ‘neutrino’ system, in section 15.2.3. Let us repeat
here how it goes for these string world sheet fermions. Again, we assume a lattice on the
world sheet, while the Dirac equation on the lattice now reduces to a ﬁnite-step equation,
so chosen as to yield exactly the same solutions (17.131):

,
i = 1, · · · , d −1 .
(17.132)
The deterministic counterpart is a Boolean variable set si(x, t) , which we assume to be
taking the values ±1 . One may write their evolution equation as
si(x, t) = si(x −1, t −1) si(x + 1, t −1) si(x, t −2) .
(17.133)
of which the solution can be written as
si(x, t) = si
L(x, t) si
R(r, t) ,
(17.134)
183

where si
L and si
R obey
si
L(x, t) = si
L(x + 1, t −1) ;
si
R(x, t) = si
R(x −1, t −1) ,
(17.135)
which is the Boolean analogue of the Dirac equation (17.132).
One can see right away that all basis elements of the Hilbert space for the Dirac
equation can be mapped one-to-one onto the states of our Boolean variables. If we would
start with these states, there is a straightforward way to construct the anti-commuting
ﬁeld operators ψi
L,R(x, t) of our fermionic system, the Jordan-Wigner transformation [4],
also alluded to in section 15.2.3. At every allowed value of the parameter set (x, i, α) ,
where α stands for L or R , we have an operator ai
α(x) acting on the Boolean variable
si
α(x) as follows:
a|+⟩= |−⟩;
a|−⟩= 0 .
(17.136)
These operators, and their hermitean conjugates a† obey the mixed commutation - anti-
commutation rules
{ai
α(x), ai
α(x)} = 0 ,
{ai
α(x), ai†
α(x)} = I ,


x1 ̸= x2
and/or
i ̸= j
and/or
α ̸= β .
(17.138)
Turning the commutators in Eq. (17.138) into anti-commutators is easy, if one can
put the entire list of variables x, i and α in some order. Call them y and consider the
ordering y1 < y2 . Then, the operators ψ(y) can be deﬁned by:
ψ(y) ≡
 Y
y1<y
s(y1)

a(y) .
(17.139)
This turns the rules (17.137) and (17.138) into the anti-commutation rules for fermionic
ﬁelds:
{ψ(y1), ψ(y2)} = 0 ;
{ψ(y1), ψ†(y2)} = δ(y1, y2) .
(17.140)
In terms of the original variables, the latter rule is written as
{ψi
α(x1), ψj†
β (x2)} = δ(x1 −x2)δijδaβ .
(17.141)
Let us denote the left-movers L by α = 1 or β = 1 , and the right movers R by α = 2
or β = 2 . Then, we choose our ordering procedure for the variables y1 = (x1, i, α) and
y2 = (x2, j, β) to be deﬁned by
if α < β
then y1 < y2 ;
if α = β and x1 < x2
then y1 < y2 ;
if α = β and x1 = x2 and i < j
then y1 < y2 ,
else y1 = y2 or y1 > y2 .
(17.142)
184

This ordering is time-independent, since all left movers are arranged before all right
movers. Consequently, the solution (17.131) of the ‘quantum’ Dirac equation holds with-
out modiﬁcations in the Hilbert space here introduced.
It is very important to deﬁne these orderings of the fermionic ﬁelds meticulously, as in
Eqs. (17.142). The sign function between brackets in Eq. (17.139), which depends on the
ordering, is typical for a Jordan-Wigner transformation. We ﬁnd it here to be harmless,
but this is not always the case. Such sign functions can be an obstruction against more
complicated procedures one might wish to perform, such as interactions between several
fermions, between right-movers and left-movers, or in attempts to go to higher dimensions
(such as in k -branes, where k > 2 ).
At this point, we may safely conclude that our dual mapping between quantised strings
and classical lattice strings continues to hold in case of the superstring.
17.3.5.
Deterministic strings and the longitudinal modes
The transverse modes of the (non interacting) quantum bosonic and superstrings (in ﬂat
Minkowski space-time) could be mapped onto a deterministic theory of strings moving
along a target space lattice. How do we add the longitudinal coordinates, and how do
we check Lorentz invariance? The correct way to proceed is ﬁrst to look at the quantum
theory, where these questions are answered routinely in terms of quantum operators.
Now we did have to replace the continuum of the world sheet by a lattice, but we
claim that this has no physical eﬀect because we can choose this lattice as ﬁne as we
please whereas rescaling of the world sheet has no eﬀect on the physics since this is just a
coordinate transformation on the world sheet. We do have to take the limit ℓ→∞but
this seems not to be diﬃcult.
Let us ﬁrst eliminate the eﬀects of this lattice as much as possible. Rewrite Eqs. (17.5)
and (17.6) as:
p(x, t) = ∂xk(x, t) ,
aL,R(x, t) = ∂xbL,R(x, t) ;
(17.143)
bL(x + t) = k(x, t) + q(x, t) ;
bR(x −t) = k(x, t) −q(x, t) ;
(17.144)
the new ﬁelds now obey the equal time commutation rules
[q(x, t), k(x′, t)]
=
1
2i sgn(x −x′ ) ;
(17.145)
[bL(x), bL(y)]
=
−[bR(x), bR(y)] = −i sgn(x −y) ,
(17.146)
where sgn(x) = 1 if x > 0 , sgn(x) = −1 if x < 0 and sgn(0) = 0 .
Staying with the continuum for the moment, we cannot distinguish two “adjacent”
sites, so there will be no improvement when we try to replace an edge state that is singular
at η(x) = ±π by one that is singular when this value is reached at two adjacent sites;
in the continuum, we expect our ﬁelds to be continuous. In any case, we now drop the
attempt that gave us the expressions (17.56) and (17.57), but just accept that there is
a single edge state at every point.
This means that, now, we replace these mapping
185

equations by
bL(x)

2πζR
op(x) ,
(17.148)
where the functions BL,R will actually play the role of the integer parts of the coordinates
of the string, and ζL,R
op (x) are deﬁned by their action on the integer valued functions
BL,R(x) , as follows:
eiζL(x1)|{BL,R(x)}⟩= |{B′L,R(x)}⟩,
n B′L(x)
=
BL(x) + θ(x −x1 ) ,
B′R(x)
=
BR(x) ;
(17.149)
eiζR(x1)|{BL,R(x)}⟩= |{B′′L,R(x)}⟩,
n B′′L(x)
=
BL(x) ,
B′′R(x)
=
BR(x) + θ(x1 −x) ,
(17.150)
so that, disregarding the edge state,
[BL(x), ζL(y)] = −iθ(x −y) ,
[BR(x), ζR(y)] = −iθ(y −x) .
(17.151)
This gives the commutation rules (17.146). If we consider again a lattice in x space, where
the states are given in the ζ basis, then the operator BL
op(x) obeying commutation rule
(17.151) can be written as
BL
op(x1) =
X
y<x1
−i
∂
∂ζL(y) .
(17.152)
Now the equations of motion of the transverse string states are clear.
These just
separate into left-movers and right-movers, both for the discrete lattice sites Xi(σ, τ)
and for the periodic ηi(σ, τ) functions, where i = 1, · · · , d −1 . Also, the longitudinal
modes split up into left moving ones and right moving ones. These, however, are ﬁxed
by the gauge constraints. In standard string theory, we can use the light cone gauge to
postulate that the coordinate variable X+ is given in an arbitrary way by the world sheet
coordinates, and one typically chooses the constraint equations (17.101).
This means that
a+
L(σ) = 1 ,
a+
R(τ) = 1 ,
(17.153)
but by simple coordinate transformations σ →σ1(σ) and τ →τ1(τ) , one can choose
any other positive function of the coordinate σ (left-mover) or τ (right mover). Now,
Eqs. (17.95) here mean that
(aµ
L(σ))2 = (aµ
R(τ))2 = 0 ,
(17.154)
so that, as in Eqs. (17.102) and (17.103), we have the constraints
a+
L(σ) = 1

d−1

i=1
(ai

a+
R(τ) = 1

(17.155)
186

where ai
L,R(x) = ∂xbi
R,L(x) (see the deﬁnitions 17.143).
In view of Eq. (17.152) for the operator Bi
L(x) , it is now tempting to write for the
longitudinal coordinate X+
L :
∂σBi
L(σ) = −i
∂
∂ζi

,
(17.156)
but the reader may have noticed that we now disregarded the edge states, which here
may cause problems: they occur whenever the functions ηi cross the values ±π , where
we must postulate periodicity.
We see that we do encounter problems if we want to deﬁne the longitudinal coordi-
nates in the compactiﬁed classical ﬁeld theory. Similarly, this is also hard in the discrete
automaton model, where we only keep the Bi
L,R as our independent ontological variables.
How do we take their partial derivatives in σ and τ ?
Here, we can bring forward that the gauge conditions (17.153) may have to be replaced
by Dirac delta functions, so as to reﬂect our choice of a world sheet lattice.
These aspects of the string models we have been considering are not well understood.
This subsection was added to demonstrate brieﬂy what happens if we study the gauge
constraints of the theory to get some understanding of the longitudinal modes, in terms of
the ontological states. At ﬁrst sight it seemed that the compactiﬁed deterministic theory
would oﬀer better chances to allow us to rigorously derive what these modes look like; it
seems as if we can replace the world sheet lattice by a continuum, but the diﬃculties are
not entirely resolved.
If we adopt the cellular automaton based on the integers Bi
L,R , use of a world sheet
lattice is almost inevitable. On the world sheet, the continuum limit has to be taken with
much care.
17.3.6.
Some brief remarks on (super) string interactions
As long as our (super) strings do not interact, the eﬀects of the constraints are minor.
They tell us what the coordinates X−(σ, τ) are if we know all other coordinates on the
world sheet. In the previous section, our point was that the evolution of these coordinates
on the world sheet is deterministic. Our mappings from the deterministic string states
onto the quantum string states is one-to-one, apart from the edge states that we choose
to ignore. In the text books on string theory, superstring interactions are described by
allowing topologically non-trivial world sheets. In practice, this means that strings may
exchange arms when they meet at one point, or their end points may join or tear apart.
All this is then controlled by a string coupling constant gs ; an expansion in powers of gs
yields string world sheet diagrams with successively higher topologies.
Curiously, one may very well imagine a string interaction that is deterministic, exactly
as the bulk theory obeys deterministic equations. Since, in previous sections, we did not
refer to topological boundary conditions, we regard the deterministic description obtained
there as a property of the string’s ‘bulk’.
187

A natural-looking string interaction would be obtained if we postulate the following:
Whenever two strings meet at one point on the space-time lattice, they ex-
change arms, as depicted in Fig. 15.
This “law of motion” is deterministic, and unambiguous, provided that both strings are
oriented strings. The deterministic version of the interaction would not involve any freely
adjustable string constant gs .
If we did not have the problem how exactly to deﬁne the longitudinal components
of the space-time coordinates, this would complete our description of the deterministic
string laws. Now, however, we do have the problem that the longitudinal coordinates
are ‘quantum’; they are obtained from constraints that are non-linear in the other ﬁelds
Xµ(σ, τ) , each of which contain integer parts and fractional parts that do not commute.
Figure 15: Deterministic string interaction. This interaction takes place whenever
two pieces of string meet at one space-time point.
This problem, unfortunately, is signiﬁcant. It appears to imply that, in terms of the
‘deterministic’ variables, we cannot exactly specify where on the world sheet the exchange
depicted in Figure 15 takes place. This diﬃculty has not been resolved, so as yet we cannot
produce a ‘deterministic’ model of interacting ‘quantum’ strings.
We conclude from our exercise in string theory that strings appear to admit a descrip-
tion in terms of ontological objects, but just not yet quite. The most severe diﬃculties lie
in the longitudinal modes. They are needed to understand how the theory can be made
Lorentz invariant. It so happens that local Lorentz invariance is a problem for every
theory that attempts to describe the laws of nature at the Planck scale, so it should not
come as a surprise that we have these problems here as well. We suspect that today’s
incomplete understanding of Lorentz invariance at the Planck scale needs to be repaired,
but it may well be that this can only be done in full harmony with the Cellular Automaton
Interpretation. What this section suggests us is that this cannot be done solely within the
framework of string theory, although strings may perhaps be helpful to lead us to further
ideas.
An example of a corner of string theory that has to be swept clean is the black hole
issue. Here also, strings seem to capture the physical properties of black holes partly
but not completely; as long as this is the case one should not expect us to be able to
formulate a concise ontological theory. This is why most parts of this book concentrate
on the general philosophy of the CAI rather than attempting to construct a complete
model.

18.
Symmetries
In classical and in quantum systems, we have Noether’s theorem [1]:
Whenever there is a continuous symmetry in a system, there exists a conserved
quantity associated with it.
Examples are conservation of momentum (translation symmetry), conservation of energy
(symmetry with respect to time translations), and angular momentum (rotation sym-
metry). In classical systems, Noether’s theorem is limited to continuous symmetries, in
quantum systems, this theorem is even more universal: here also discrete symmetries have
their associated conservation laws: parity P = ±1 of a system or particle (mirror sym-
metry), non commuting discrete quantum numbers associated with more general discrete
permutations, etc. Also, in a quantum system, one can reverse the theorem:
Every conserved quantity is associated to a symmetry,
for instance isospin symmetry follows from the conservation of the isospin vector ⃗I =
(I1, I2, I3) , baryon number conservation leads to a symmetry with respect to U(1) rota-
tions of baryonic wave functions, and so on.
18.1.
Classical and quantum symmetries
We now claim that this more generalised Noether theorem can also be applied to classical
systems, simply by attaching a basis element of Hilbert space to every state the classical
system can be in. If, for instance, the evolution law Ut, t+δt is independent of time t , we
have a conserved energy. This energy is obtained from the eigenvalue of Ut, t+δt for the
smallest admissible value of δt . Now since an energy eigenstate will usually not be an
ontological state of the system, this energy conservation law only emerges in our quantum
procedure; it does not show up in standard classical considerations. For us, this is very
important: if δt is as small as the Planck time, the energy eigenstates, all the way to
the Planck energy, are superpositions of ontological states. If, as we usually do, we limit
ourselves to quantum systems with much lower energies, we are singling out a section of
Hilbert space that is not represented by individual ontological states, and for this reason
we should not expect recognisable classical features in the quantum systems that we are
usually looking at: atoms, molecules, elementary particles.
Often, our deterministic models are based on a lattice rather than a space-time con-
tinuum. The classical space-time symmetries on a lattice are more restricted than those
of a continuum. It is here that our mappings onto quantum systems may help. If we
allow ontological states to have symmetry relations with superimposed states, much more
general symmetry groups may be encountered. This is further illustrated in this chapter.
Since we often work with models having only ﬁnite amounts of data in the form of
bits and bytes in given volume elements, we are naturally led to systems deﬁned on a
lattice. There are many ways in which points can be arranged in a lattice conﬁguration,
189

as is well known from the study of the arrangement of atoms in crystalline minerals. The
symmetry properties of the minerals are characterised by the set of crystallographic point
groups, of which there are 32 in three dimensions. [46]
The simplest of these is the cubic symmetry group generated by a cubic lattice:
⃗x = (n1, n2, n3) ,
(18.1)
where n1, n2 and n3 are integers. What we call the cubic group here, is the set of all 48
orthogonal rotations including the reﬂections of these three integers into ± each other (6
permutations and 23 signs). This group, called O(3, Z) , is obviously much smaller than
the group O(3, R) of all orthonormal rotations. The cubic group is a ﬁnite subgroup of
the inﬁnite orthogonal group.
Yet in string theory, section 17.3.2, something peculiar seems to happen: even though
the string theory is equivalent to a lattice model, it nevertheless appears not to lose its
full orthogonal rotation symmetry. How can this be explained?
18.2.
Continuous transformations on a lattice
Consider a classical model whose states are deﬁned by data that can be arranged in a d di-
mensional cubic lattice. Rotation symmetry is then usually limited by the group O(d, Z) .
If now we introduce our Hilbert space, such that every state of the classical system is a
basis element of that, then we can introduce superpositions, and much more symmetry
groups are possible. There are several ways now to introduce continuous translations and
rotations.
To this end, it is, again, very instructive to do the Fourier transformation:
⟨⃗x|ψ⟩= (2π)−d/2
Z
|κi|<π
dd⃗κ⟨⃗κ|ψ⟩ei⃗κ·⃗x ,
(18.2)
Here, |ψ⟩describes a single particle living on the lattice, but we could also take it as
the operator ﬁeld of a second-quantised system, as is usual in quantum ﬁeld theories. Of
course, as is usual in physics notation, ⟨⃗x| are the bras in x space (where ⃗x is Eq. (18.1),
the lattice), whereas ⟨⃗κ| are the bras in momentum space, where ⃗κ are continuous, and
all its components κi obey |κi| < π .
The inverse of the Fourier transform (18.2) is:
⟨⃗κ|ψ⟩= (2π)−d/2 X
⃗x∈Zd
⟨⃗x|ψ⟩e−i⃗κ·⃗x .
(18.3)
18.2.1.
Continuous translations
Translations over any distance ⃗a can now be deﬁned as the operation
⟨⃗κ|ψ⟩→⟨⃗κ|ψ⟩e−i⃗κ·⃗a ,
(18.4)
190

although only if ⃗a has integer components, this represents an ontological shift
⟨⃗x|ψ⟩→⟨⃗x −⃗a |ψ⟩,
(18.5)
since ⃗x must sit in the lattice, otherwise this would represent a non ontological state.
If ⃗a has fractional components, the translation in x space can still be deﬁned. Take
for instance a fractional value for ax , or, ⃗a = (ax, 0, 0) . Then
⟨κx|ψ⟩→⟨κx|ψ⟩e−iκxax ,
⟨x|ψ⟩→
X
x′
⟨x′|ψ⟩∆ax(x −x′) ,
∆ax(x1) = (2π)−1
Z π
−π
dκx e−iaxκx+iκx x1 = sin π(x1 −ax)
π (x1 −ax)
,
(18.6)
where we also used Eq. (18.3) for the inverse of Eq. (18.2).
One easily observes that Eq. (18.6) reduces to Eq. (18.5) if ax tends to an integer.
Translations over a completely arbitrary vector ⃗a are obtained as the product of fractional
translations over (ax, 0, 0) , (0, ay, 0) and (0, 0, az) :
⟨⃗x|ψ⟩→
X
x′, y′, z′
⟨⃗x ′|ψ⟩∆⃗a(⃗x −⃗x ′) ,
∆⃗a(⃗x1) = ∆ax(x1)∆ay(y1)∆az(z1) .
(18.7)
Notice that the kernel function ∆⃗a(⃗x1) maximises for the values of ⃗x1 closest to ⃗a ,
so, even for translations over fractional values of the components of ⃗a , the translation
operation involves only the components of |ψ⟩closest to the target value ⃗x −⃗a .
The generator for inﬁnitesimal translations is the operator ⃗η op . Translations over a ﬁ-
nite distance ⃗a can then be described by the operator ei⃗a·⃗η op . Writing ⃗η op = (ηx, ηy, ηz) ,
and taking ηx, ηy, and ηz each to act only in one dimension, we have
⟨⃗κ| ⃗η op |ψ⟩= −⃗κ ⟨⃗κ|ψ⟩,
(18.8)
⟨x| eiηx ax|ψ⟩=
X
x′
⟨x′|ψ⟩sin π(x −x′ −ax)
π(x −x′ −ax)
,
(18.9)
and when ax is taken to be inﬁnitesimal, while x and x′ are integers, one ﬁnds
⟨x|(I + iηxax)|ψ⟩
=
X

⟨x′|ψ⟩

⟨x| ηx |x⟩= 0 ,
⟨x| ηx |x′⟩= i (−1)x−x′
x −x′
if x ̸= x′ .
(18.11)
The eigenstates |ηx⟩of the operator ηx can be found: ⟨x|ηx⟩= e−iηxx .
The expressions we found for this generator are the most natural ones but not the
only possible choices; we must always remember that one may add multiples of 2π to its
eigenvalues. This modiﬁes the matrix elements (18.11) while the eﬀects of translations
over integer distances remain the same.
191

An important feature of our deﬁnition of fractional translations on a lattice is their
commutation rules. These translations are entirely commutative (as we can deduce from
the deﬁnition Eq. (18.4)):
[⃗η, ⃗η ′] = 0 .
(18.12)
18.2.2.
Continuous rotations 1: Covering the Brillouin zone with circular regions
What can be done with translations on a lattice, can also be done for rotations, in various
ways. Let us ﬁrst show how to obtain a perfect general rotation operator on a lattice, in
principle. Again, we start from the Fourier modes, eiκx , Eq. (18.2). How do we generate
arbitrary rotations?
Taking again the cubic lattice as our prototype, we immediately see the diﬃculty: the
space of allowed values for ⃗κ is a square (in 2 dimensions) or a cube (in 3 dimensions).
This square and this cube are only invariant under the discrete rotation group O(d, Z) .
Therefore, rotations over other angles can at best be approximate, it seems. We illustrate
the situation for a two-dimensional square lattice, but extrapolation to d > 2 space
dimensions and/or other lattice conﬁgurations is straightforward.
The space of allowed momentum values is called the Brillouin zone, and it is the
square in Figure 16 a . A ﬁrst approximation for a rotation of the lattice by any angle
ϕ is obtained by drawing the largest possible circle in the Brillouin zone (or the largest
possible sphere in the 3 or higher dimensional case) and rotate the region inside that. The
data on the remainder of the Brillouin zone, outside the circle, are ignored or replaced by
zero.
This procedure perhaps looks good for the lower frequency modes, but it does not
rotate everything, and it would clearly disobey the desired group properties of rotations
and translations, so we must do something better with the remainder of the Brillouin zone.
This is possible, see Fig 16 b . The rotation operator could then be deﬁned as follows.
We ﬁll the entire Brillouin zone with circular regions, such that they completely cover
the entire space without overlappings. As will be explained shortly, we prefer to keep these
circles as large as possible to get the best46 result. The action of the rotation operator
will now be deﬁned to correspond to a rotation over the same angle ϕ inside all of these
circles (arrows in Figs. 16 a and b ). With “circles” we here mean circular regions, or, if
d > 2 , regions bounded by (d −1) -spheres.
This is – nearly47 – the best we can do in the Brillouin zone, being the space of the
Fourier vectors ⃗κ . The reason why we split the Brillouin zones into perfectly spherical
regions, rather than other shapes, becomes clear if we inspect the action of this operator
in ⃗x -space: how does this operator work in the original space of the lattice sites ⃗x ?
Let us ﬁrst consider the action of a single circle, while the data on the rest of the
Brillouin zone are replaced by zero. First take a circle (if d = 2 ) or sphere (if d = 3 )
46“best” here means that the eﬀect of the rotation is maximally local, as will be seen in the sequel.
47A slight complication that can be cured, is explained shortly after Eq. (18.19) on page 195.

a) We can
limit ourselves to the region inside the largest circle that ﬁts in the Brillouin zone

This is good if strongly ﬂuctuating modes in ⃗x space may be ignored, such as in
a photograph with a rectangular grid of pixels. b) Unitarity is restored if we also
ﬁll the remainder of the Brillouin zone also with circles, B, C, etc., the larger the
better (as explained in the text), but never overlapping. In the picture, the shaded

circle by the same angle ϕ (arrows).

all directions, using the kernel Kd(y) . The smaller the radius r , the further out the
smearing, which is why we should try to keep our circles (spheres) as large as possible.
Next, we notice that most of the circles in Fig. 16 b are oﬀ-centre. A displacement by
a vector ⃗κ1 in the Brillouin zone corresponds to a multiplication in conﬁguration space
by the exponent ei⃗κ1·⃗x . Projecting out a circle with radius r and its origin on the spot
⃗κ1 in the Brillouin zone, means dividing the wave function ψ(⃗x) by the exponent ei⃗κ1·⃗x ,
smearing it with the kernel Kd(y) , then multiplying with the exponent again (thus, we
bring the circle to the origin, project out the centralised circle, then move it back to where
it was). This amounts to smearing the original wave function with the modiﬁed kernel
Kd (y,⃗κ1) = Kd (y)ei⃗κ1·(⃗x−⃗x ′) ,
y = r
π|⃗x −⃗x ′| .
(18.16)
If we add the projections of all circles with which we covered the Brillouin zone, the
total eﬀect should be that we recover the original wave function on the lattice.
And now we can rotate. Rotating a circle (r, κ1) in the Brillouin zone over any angle
ϕ has exactly the same eﬀect as 1) ﬁnding the smeared wave function using the kernel
Kd (y) e−i⃗κ1·⃗x ′ , rotating the resulting continuous function over the angle ϕ in ⃗x -space,
and then multiplying with the exponential ei⃗κ1·⃗x . If we add together the eﬀects of all
circles, we get the rotation operator. If we want the eﬀect of an orthogonal rotation Ω
in ⃗x -space, then this results in
ψ′(⃗x) =

(18.17)
where the index i counts the circles covering the Brillouin zone.
The transformations described in this subsection form a perfectly acceptable rotation
group, converging to the usual rotations in the continuum limit. This can easily be seen
by noting that the continuum case is dominated by the small values of ⃗κ , which are all in
the primary circle. The other circles also rotate the wave functions to the desired location,
but they only move along the rapidly oscillating parts, while the vectors ⃗κ1 stay oriented
in the original direction.
The desired group properties of this operator follow from the fact that the circles cover
the Brillouin zone exactly once.
Ω3 = Ω1Ω2 .
(18.18)
194

Of course, the operation (18.17), to be referred to as R(Ω) , is not quite an ordinary rota-
tion. If T(⃗a) is the translation over a non-lattice vector ⃗a as described in section 18.2.1,
then
R(Ω) T(⃗a) ̸= T(Ω⃗a) R(Ω) ,
(18.19)
and furthermore, if Ωis chosen to be one of the elements of the crystal group of the
lattice, R(Ω) does still not coincide with Ωitself. This latter defect can be cured, but
we won’t go into these details.
The best feature of this rotation operator is that it appears to act really locally in
⃗x -space, spreading the lattice points only slightly with the Bessel function kernels (18.14),
but it also has disadvantages: it will be extremely diﬃcult to construct some deterministic
evolution law that respects this transformation as a symmetry. For this reason, we now
consider other continuous transformation prescriptions that yield rotations.
18.2.3.
Continuous rotations 2: Using Noether charges and a discrete sub group
In a deterministic theory then, we wish to identify an evolution law that respects our
symmetries. This requires a diﬀerent choice for the deﬁnitions of the symmetries involved.
To this end, we enter Noether’s theorem, as it was introduced at the beginning of this
chapter. For example, symmetry under time translations is associated to the conservation
of energy, translation symmetry is associated to momentum conservation, and rotation
symmetry leads to the conservation of angular momentum. We refer to these conserved
quantities as Noether charges.
All these conserved charges are observable quantities,
and therefore, if we wish to investigate them in a quantum theory that we relate to
a deterministic system, then this deterministic system should also exhibit observable
quantities that can be directly related to the Noether charges.
In the PQ formalism, the Noether charges for translation symmetry are built in, in a
sense. Translations in the Qi variables are associated to quantities pi , of which the integer
parts Pi are ontological observables.
Only the fractional parts generate translations,
which then must be integer steps on the Q lattice. We need both components of the
momentum. If the lattice length is small, the quanta of the integer parts of the momenta
are large. Planets have very large momenta, cold atoms have very small momenta. Large
momenta also are sources of gravitational ﬁelds, and as such directly observable. What
about the transition region? It happens to be in a very familiar domain – the Planck unit
of momentum is ∼6.5 kg m/sec . Momentum in that domain must be a mixture of the
P observables and the Q displacement operators, whereas in ordinary physics we notice
nothing special in that domain.
In the case of angular momentum, we may note that angular momentum is quantised
anyway. Can we associate an ontological observable (beable) to angular momentum? Not
so easily, because angular momentum consists of non-commuting components. At best
we will have ontological quantised variables playing the role of “the classical parts” of
angular momentum, supplemented by quantum degrees of freedom (changeables) that
restore the commutation rules. We observe that, for small particles, angular momentum
195

is only partly observable; sometimes it is a beable, sometimes a changeable. For large
systems, angular momentum is observable, with some margin of error.
This leads us to consider the following structure – and indeed we will have to use
similar methods whenever a symmetry group becomes large, meaning that it has very
many elements.
Since angular momenta are non commutative, they cannot be quite
ontological, but their ‘classical parts’ must be.
Therefore, we assume that the total
angular momenta operators Ji can be written as follows:
Ji = Li + λi ,
[Ji, Jj] = iεijkJk ,
(18.20)
where Li represents the expectation values of Ji in all ontological states, so that Li
are beables. The λi represent the remainder, and their expectation values in ontological
states vanish:
⟨ont|λi|ont⟩= 0
for each ontological state |ont⟩.
(18.21)
The following subsection will show an explicit procedure to obtain Li and λi .
18.2.4.
Continuous rotations 3: Using the real number operators p and q con-
structed out of P and Q
If our theory is deﬁned on a lattice, there is another great way to recover many of the
symmetries of the continuum case, by using the PQ trick as it was exposed in section 16.
We saw that string theory, section 17.3, was re-written in such a way that the string
moves on a lattice in target space, where the lattice basically describes the integer parts
of the coordinates, while the space in between the lattice sites actually correspond to
the eigenstates of the displacement operators for the momentum variables P . Together,
they form a continuum, and since the entire system is equivalent to the continuum string
theory, it also shares all continuous translation and rotation symmetries with that theory.
By allowing the application of this mechanism, string theory appears to be more
powerful than theories of point particles; the commutation rules for the operators in
target space are fundamentally diﬀerent, and string theory allows target space to be in a
high number of dimensions.
Thus, in the PQ formalism, we now use the continuum deﬁnition of angular momen-
tum. Consider the wave function of a single particle in three space dimensions, so that
it lives on the product of three P, Q lattices. These lattices generate the three quantum
coordinates qi . Its Hilbert space H is the product space of three Hilbert spaces H1, H2
and H3 .
Write, as in Eqs. (16.18) and (16.19),
qop
i
= Qi + aop
i
,
pop
i
= 2πPi + bop
i
,
(18.22)
so that the angular momentum operator is (in the 3-dimensional case)
Ji = εijkqop
j pop
k
= εijk(2πQjPk + 2πaop
j Pk + Qjbop
k + aop
j bop
k ) .
(18.23)
196

Since the expectation values of aop
i
and bop
i
vanish in the ontological states, |ont⟩=
|⃗P, ⃗Q⟩, and since the last term will be ≤O(2π) , we can identify Li with the ﬁrst term:
Li ≈2π εijkQjPk .
(18.24)
Note, that the Li are quantised in multiples of 2π rather than one, as one might have
expected, so Eq. (18.24) cannot hold exactly.
Let us now inspect the modiﬁcations on the commutation rules of these angular mo-
mentum operators caused by the edge states. In each of the three Hilbert spaces Hi ,
i = 1, 2, 3, , we have Eq. (16.22), while the operators of one of these Hilbert spaces
commute with those of the others. Writing the indices explicitly:
[q1, p1] = i I2I3 ( I1 −|ψ1
e⟩⟨ψ1
e| ) ,
[q1, p2] = 0 ,
and cyclic permutations,
(18.25)
where Ii are the identity operators in the ith Hilbert space, and |ψi
e⟩are the edge states
on the ith
P, Q lattice.
One then easily derives that the three angular momentum
operators Ji deﬁned in the usual way, Eq. (18.23), obey the commutation rules
[J1, J2] = iJ3 I1I2 ( I3 −|ψ3
e⟩⟨ψ3
e| ) ,
and cyclic permutations.
(18.26)
The importance of this result is that now we observe that the operator J3 only acts in
Hilbert spaces 1 and 2, but is proportional to the identity in H3 (since J3 contains only
q1, q2, p1, and p2 ). So the projection operator for the edge state |ψ3
e⟩commutes with J3 .
This implies that, if we limit ourselves to states that are orthogonal to the edge states, they
will also rotate to states orthogonal to the edge states. In this subspace of Hilbert space
the rotations act normally. And we think that this is remarkable, because certainly the
“ontological” basis deﬁned on the six-dimensional ⃗P, ⃗Q lattice has no built-in continuous
rotation invariance at all.
18.2.5.
Quantum symmetries and classical evolution
In previous subsections it was observed that, when we project classical models on Hilbert
spaces, new symmetries may emerge.
These are symmetry transformations that map
classical states onto superpositions of states. A few examples were shown.
None of our procedures are fool proof. In the special case to be discussed next, we
study time translation invariance. As stated earlier, we might split the energy E into a
classical part ( δE ) and a quantum part (the generator of discrete time translations, the
Hamiltonian H that lies in the interval [0, 2π/δt) . However, this would suggest that we
can only measure energies with 2π/δt as our margin of error. That cannot be right: if
δt is the Planck time, then the energy quantum is the Planck energy, EPlanck , which is
about 543 kiloWatt-hours; yet we pay our electricity bills per kiloWatt-hour, and those
bills are certainly ontological. Mutations in our DNA proﬁles might require only a couple
of electronVolts to take place, and these might be crucial for our genetically inherited
identities; an electronVolt is about 10−28 times the Planck energy. Even that may have
to be (mostly) ontological.
197

Of course we are primarily interested in symmetries that are symmetries of the evolu-
tion operator. The cogwheel model, section 2.2.1, for instance has the classical symmetry
of rotations over N steps, if N is the number of cogwheel position states. But if we go
to the energy eigenstates |k⟩H, k = 0, · · · N −1 (Eqs. 2.21 and 2.22), we see that, there,
a translation over n teeth corresponds to multiplication of these states as follows:
|k⟩H →e2πikn/N|k⟩H .
(18.27)
Since these are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, this multiplication commutes with H and
hence the symmetry is preserved by the evolution law.
We now found out that we can enlarge the symmetry group by choosing the multipli-
cation factors in frequency space
|k⟩H →e2πikα/N|k⟩H .
(18.28)
where α now may be any real number, and this also corresponds to a translation in time
over the real number α . This enhances the symmetry group from the group of the cyclic
permutations of N elements to the group of the continuous rotations of a circle.
18.2.6.
Quantum symmetries and classical evolution 2
An other rather trivial yet interesting example of a symmetry that is enlarged if we apply
our quantum constructions, occurs in a simple cellular automaton in any number d of
space dimensions. Consider the Boolean variables σ(⃗x, t) = ±1 distributed over all even
sites in a lattice space-time, that is, over all points (⃗x, t) = (x1, · · · , xd, t) with xi and
t all integers, and x1 + · · · + xd + t = even.
Let the evolution law be
σ(⃗x, t + 1) =

d
Y
i=1
σ(⃗x + ⃗ei , t) σ(⃗x −⃗ei , t)

σ(⃗x , t −1) ,
(18.29)
where ⃗ei are the unit vectors in the ith direction in d dimensional space. Or: the product
of the data on all direct space-time neighbours of any odd site (⃗x, t) is +1 . This law is
manifestly invariant under time reversal, and we see that it ﬁxes all variables if the data
are given on a Cauchy surface consisting of two consecutive layers in time t, t −1 . The
classical model has the manifest translation symmetry over vectors δx = (a1, · · · , ad, τ)
with P
i ai + τ even.
Now let us introduce Hilbert space, and consider the odd lattice sites. On these odd
sites, we deﬁne the action of changeables σ1(⃗x1, t1) as follows:
The data on the time frame t = t1 , are kept unchanged;
on the time frame t = t1 −1 , only σ(⃗x1, t1 −1) changes sign, and all others
remain unchanged;
consequently, according to the evolution law, also on the time frame t = t1+1 ,
only σ(⃗x1, t1 + 1) changes sign, all others stay the same.
198

The reason for the notation σ1 is that in a basis of Hilbert space where σ(⃗x1, t1 −1) =
σ3 = ( 1
0
0 −1) , our new operator is σ1(⃗x, t1) = σ1 = (0
1
1
0) , as in the Pauli matrices.
Now, checking how the action of σ1(⃗x, t) propagates through the lattice, we observe
that
σ1(⃗x, t + 1) =

d
Y
i=1
σ1(⃗x + ⃗ei , t) σ1(⃗x −⃗ei , t)

σ1(⃗x , t −1) ,
(18.30)
where now the vector (⃗x, t) is even, while in Eq. (18.29) they were odd. Thus the product
of the changeables σ1(⃗x′, t′) that are direct space-time neighbours of an even site (⃗x, t)
is also one.

model described by Eq. (18.29), in two space dimensions, with data only on the
even lattice sites (smaller square, tilted by 45◦), and b) the Brillouin zone for the
Hilbert space description of this model (larger square)
Since we recovered the same evolution law but now on the sites that before were empty,
our translation symmetry group now has twice as many elements. Now, we can perform
a translation over a vector, whose sum of components is odd, but the states in Hilbert
space then have to undergo a transformation; at every site:
|ψ(⃗x, t)⟩→Uop|ψ(⃗x, t)⟩,
Uop σ1U −1
op = σ3 ;
Uop =

2( 1

(18.31)
Since U 2 = 1 , this is actually a reﬂection. This means that the succession of two odd
translations gives an even translation without further phase changes.
This simple model shows how the introduction of Hilbert space may enhance the
symmetry properties of a theory. In this case it also implies that the Brillouin zone for
momentum space becomes twice as large (see Fig. 18). A quantum physicist living in this
world will not be able to distinguish the even sites from the odd ones.
18.3.
Large symmetry groups in the CAI
We end this chapter with a general view of large symmetry groups, such as translations in
space and in time, and the Lorentz group. They have inﬁnite numbers of group elements.
199

Now we imagine our automaton models to have discretised amounts of information spread
over space and time. How can we have inﬁnite and/or continuous symmetry groups act
on them?
Our impression from the previous results is that the conventional symmetry generators,
as used in quantum theories, will be operators that always consist of combinations of
beables and changeables: the Noether charges, such as angular momentum, energy and
momentum, will have classical limits that are perfectly observable, hence they are beables;
yet quantum mechanically, the operators do not commute, and so there must also be
changeable parts.
The beable parts will be conjugated to the tiniest symmetry operations such as very
tiny translations and rotations. These are unlikely to be useful as genuine transformations
among the ontological data – of course they are not, since they must commute with the
beables.
The changeable parts of these operators are not ontological observables as they do not
commute. The P Q formalism, elaborated in section 16, is a realisation of this concept of
splitting the operators: here, both in position space and in momentum space, the integer
parts of the translation operators are beables, the fractional parts are changeables. The
continuous translation operators pop consist of both ingredients. We suspect that this
will have to become a general feature of all large symmetry groups, in particular the
Hamiltonian itself, and this is what we shall attempt to implement in the next chapter,
19.
19.
The discretised Hamiltonian formalism in PQ theory
19.1.
The vacuum state, and the double role of the Hamiltonian (cont’d)
The energy conservation law is usually regarded as an interesting and important feature
of both classical and quantum mechanics, but it is often not fully realised how important
the role of this law really is. The importance of energy is that it is conserved, it is deﬁned
locally, and that it cannot be negative48. This allows us to deﬁne the vacuum as the single
quantum state of the universe that has the lowest possible energy (or energy per unit of
volume).
Consider a small perturbation of this vacuum: a light particle, or a grain of dust.
It carries only a small amount of energy.
In our world, this energy cannot increase
spontaneously, because the surrounding vacuum cannot deliver it, and its own energy
cannot increase. All transitions, all processes inside the grain of dust, can only transform
the object into other states with exactly the same energy. If the object decays, the decay
products must have even lower amounts of energy. Since the number of distinct states
48Often, the Casimir eﬀect is brought forward as a counter example. Of course, it is important to realise
that this eﬀect can produce small regions of negative energy, but those regions are always accompanied
by domains of much larger amounts of positive energy nearby, so that this eﬀect has little impact on the
fundamental issues of stability raised here.
200

with the same or less energy is very limited, not much can happen; the object represents
a very stable situation.
But now imagine an alien world where the concept of a conserved, positive energy
would not exist. Perhaps our alien world would nevertheless have something like a vacuum
state, but it would have to be deﬁned diﬀerently. In this alien world, our tiny object could
grow spontaneously, since we postulated that there is no conserved quantity such as energy
to stop it from doing so. What this means is that the tiniest perturbations around the
vacuum state will destabilise this vacuum. Similarly, any other initial state may turn out
to be unstable49.
We can state this diﬀerently: solutions of the equations of motion are stationary if
they are in thermal equilibrium (possibly with one or more chemical potentials added).
In a thermal equilibrium, we have the Boltzmann distribution:
Wi = C e−βEi+P
j µjRji ,
(19.1)
where β = 1/kT is the inverse of the temperature T , with Boltzmann constant k , and
i labels the states; µj are chemical potentials, and Rji the corresponding conserved
quantities.
If the energies Ei were not properly bounded from below, the lowest energies would
cause this expression to diverge, particularly at low temperatures.
What is needed is a lower bound of the energies Ei so as to ensure stability of our
world. Furthermore, having a ground state is very important to construct systematic ap-
proximations to solutions of the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation, using extremum
principles. This is not just a technical problem, it would raise doubt on the mere exis-
tence of correct solutions to Schr¨odinger’s equation, if no procedure could be described
that allows one to construct such solutions systematically.
In our world we do have a Hamiltonian function, equal to the total energy, that is
locally conserved and bounded from below. Note that “locally conserved” means that a
locally deﬁned tensor Tµν(⃗x, t) exists that obeys a local conservation law, ∂µTµν = 0 , and
this feature is connected in important ways not only to the theory of special relativity,
but also to general relativity.
Thus, the ﬁrst role played by the Hamiltonian is that it brings law and order in the
universe, by being 1) conserved in time, 2) bounded from below, and 3) local (that is, it
is the sum of completely localised contributions).
Deriving an equation of motion that permits the existence of such a function, is not
easy, but was made possible by the Hamiltonian procedure, ﬁrst worked out for continuum
theories (see section 5.6.2 in Part I).
Hamilton’s equations are the most natural ones that guarantee this mechanism to
work: ﬁrst make a judicious choice of kinetic variables xi and pi , then start with any
49The absence of a stabiliser does not imply that a dynamical system has to destabilise; the solar
system is a classical case in point, it stayed in roughly the same state for billions of years, without any
conspicuous reason for not converting into a more “probable” state. Therefore, the argument presented
here must be handled with care.
201

function H({xi, pj}) that is bounded and local as desired, and subsequently write down
the equations for dxi/dt and dpj/dt that guarantee that dH/dt = 0 . The principle is
then carried over to quantum mechanics in the standard way.
Thus, in standard physics, we have a function or operator called Hamiltonian that
represents the conserved energy on the one hand, and it generates the equations of motion
on the other.
And now, we argue that, being such a fundamental notion, the Hamiltonian principle
should also exist for discrete systems.
19.2.
The Hamilton problem for discrete deterministic systems
Consider now a discrete, deterministic system. Inevitably, time will also be discrete. Time
steps must be controlled by a deterministic evolution operator, which implies that there
must be a smallest time unit, call it δt . When we write the evolution operator U(δt)
as U(δt) = e−iE quant δt then E quant is deﬁned modulo 2π/δt , which means that we can
always choose E quant to lie in the segment
0 ≤E quant < 2π/δt ,
(19.2)
Instead, in the real world, energy is an additively conserved quantity without any
periodicity. In the PQ formalism, we have seen what the best way is to cure such a
situation, and it is natural to try the same trick for time and energy: we must add a
conserved, discrete, integer quantum to the Hamiltonian operator: E class = 2πN/δt , so
that we have an absolutely conserved energy,
E ?= E quant + E class .
(19.3)
In the classical theory, we can only use E class to ensure that our system is stable, as
described in the previous section.
In principle, it may seem to be easy to formulate a deterministic classical system where
such a quantity E class can be deﬁned, but, as we will see, there will be some obstacles of
a practical nature. Note that, if Eq. (19.3) is used to deﬁne the total energy, and if E class
reaches to inﬁnity, then time can be redeﬁned to be a continuous variable, since now we
can substitute any value t in the evolution operator U(t) = e−iEt .
One diﬃculty can be spotted right away: usually, we shall demand that energy be an
extensive quantity, that is, for two widely separated systems we expect
E tot = E1 + E2 + E int ,
(19.4)
where E int can be expected to be small, or even negligible. But then, if both E1 and
E2 are split into a classical part and a quantum part, then either the quantum part of
E tot will exceed its bounds (19.2), or E class will not be extensive, that is, it will not even
approximately be the sum of the classical parts of E1 and E2 .
202

An other way of phrasing the problem is that one might wish to write the total energy
E tot as
E tot =
X
lattice sites i
Ei →
Z
dd⃗x H(⃗x) ,
(19.5)
where Ei or H(⃗x) is the energy density. It may be possible to spread E tot
class over the
lattice, and it may be possible to rewrite E quant as a sum over lattice sites, but then it
remains hard to see that the total quantum part stays conﬁned to the interval [0, 2π/δt)
while it is treated as an extensive variable at the same time. Can the excesses be stowed
in E int ?
This question will be investigated further in our treatment of the technical details of
the cellular automaton, chapter 22.
19.3.
Conserved classical energy in PQ theory
If there is a conserved classical energy Eclass(⃗P, ⃗Q) , then the set of ⃗P, ⃗Q values with
the same total energy E forms closed surfaces ΣE . All we need to demand for a theory
in (⃗P, ⃗Q) space is that the ﬁnite-time evolution operator U(δt) generates motion along
these surfaces [94]. That does not sound hard, but in practice, to generate evolution laws
with this property is not so easy. This is because we often also demand that our evolution
operator U(δt) be time-reversible: there must exist an inverse, U −1(δt) .
In classical mechanics of continuous systems, the problem of characterising some evolu-
tion law that keeps the energy conserved was solved: let the continuous degrees of freedom
be some classical real numbers {qi(t), pi(t)} , and take energy E to be some function
E = H(⃗p, ⃗q ) = T(⃗p ) + V (⃗q ) + ⃗p · ⃗A(⃗q ) ,
(19.6)
although more general functions that are bounded below are also admitted. The last
term, describing typically magnetic forces, often occurs in practical examples, but may
be omitted for simplicity to follow the general argument.
Then take as our evolution law:
dqi
dt = ˙qi = ∂H(⃗p, ⃗q )
∂pi
,
˙pi = −∂H(⃗p, ⃗q )
∂qi
.
(19.7)
One then derives
dH(⃗p, ⃗q )
dt
= ˙H = ∂H
∂qi
˙qi + ∂H
∂pi
˙pi = ˙pi ˙qi −˙qi ˙pi = 0 .
(19.8)
This looks so easy in the continuous case that it may seem surprising that this principle
is hard to generalise to the discrete systems. Yet formally it should be easy to derive some
energy-conserving evolution law:
203

Take a lattice of integers Pi and Qi , and some bounded, integer energy
function H(⃗P, ⃗Q) . Consider some number E for the total energy. Consider
all points of the surface ΣE on our lattice deﬁned by H(⃗P, ⃗Q) = E . The
number of points on such a surface could be inﬁnite, but let us take the case
that it is ﬁnite. Then simply consider a path Pi(t), Qi(t) on ΣE , where t
enumerates the integers. The path must eventually close onto itself. This way
we get a closed path on ΣE . If there are points on our surface that are not
yet on the closed path that we just constructed, then we repeat the procedure
starting with one of those points. Repeat until ΣE is completely covered by
closed paths. These closed paths then deﬁne our evolution law.
At ﬁrst sight, however, generalising the standard Hamiltonian procedure now seems to
fail. Whereas the standard Hamiltonian formalism (19.8) for the continuous case involves
just inﬁnitesimal time steps and inﬁnitesimal changes in coordinates and momenta, we
now need ﬁnite time steps and ﬁnite changes.
One could think of making ﬁnite-size
corrections in the lattice equations, but that will not automatically work, since odds are
that, after some given time step, integer-valued points in the surface ΣE may be diﬃcult
to ﬁnd. Now with a little more patience, a systematic approach can be formulated, but
we postpone it to section 19.4.
19.3.1.
Multi-dimensional harmonic oscillator
A superior procedure will be discussed in the next subsections, but ﬁrst let us consider the
simpler case of the multi-dimensional harmonic oscillator of section 17.2, subsection 17.2.2:
take two symmetric integer-valued tensors Tij = Tji , and Vij = Vji .
The evolution
law alternates between integer and half-odd integer values of the time variable t . See
Eqs, (17.77) and (17.78):
Qi(t + 1)

Qi(t) + TijPj(t + 1

nian is

where in the last three expressions, ⃗Q = ⃗Q(t) and ⃗P + = ⃗P(t + 1
2) .
The equations
(19.11) follow from the evolution equations (19.9) and (19.10) provided that T and V
are symmetric.
204

One reads oﬀthat this Hamiltonian is time-independent. It is bounded from below if
not only V and T but also either V −1
4V TV or T −1
4TV T are bounded from below
(usually, one implies the other).
Unfortunately, this requirement is very stringent; the only solution where this energy
is properly bounded is a linear or periodic chain of coupled oscillators, as in our one-
dimensional model of massless bosons. On top of that, this formalism only allows for
strictly harmonic forces, which means that, unlike the continuum case, no non-linear
interactions can be accommodated for. A much larger class of models will be exhibited
in the next section.
Returning ﬁrst to our model of massless bosons in 1 + 1 dimensions, section 17, we
note that the classical evolution operator was deﬁned over time steps δt = 1 , and this
means that, knowing the evolution operator speciﬁes the Hamiltonian eigenvalue op to
multiples of 2π . This is exactly the range of a single creation or annihilation operator
aL,R and aL,R † . But these operators can act many times, and therefore the total energy
should be allowed to stretch much further. This is where we need the exactly conserved
discrete energy function (19.11). The fractional part of H , which we could call E quant ,
follows uniquely from the evolution operator U(δt) . Then we can add multiples of 2π
times the energy (19.11) at will. This is how the entire range of energy values of our
2 dimensional boson model results from our mapping. It cannot be a coincidence that
the angular energy function E quant together with the conserved integer valued energy
function E class taken together exactly represent the spectrum of real energy values for
the quantum theory. This is how our mappings work.
19.4.
More general, integer-valued Hamiltonian models with interactions
According to the previous section, we recuperate quantum models with a continuous time
variable from a discrete classical system if not only the evolution operator over a time
step δt is time-reversible, but in addition a conserved discrete energy beable E class exists,
taking values 2π N/δt where N is integer. Again, let us take δt = 1 . If the eigenvalues
of U op(δt) are called e−iE quant , with 0 ≤E quant < 2π then we can deﬁne the complete
Hamiltonian H to be
H = E quant + E class = 2π(ν + N) ,
(19.12)
where 0 ≤ν < 1 (or alternatively, −1/2 < ν ≤
1/2 ) and N is integer. The quantity
conjugated to that is a continuous time variable. If we furthermore demand that E class is
bounded from below then Eq. (19.12) deﬁnes a genuine quantum system with a conserved
Hamiltonian that is bounded from below.
As stated earlier, it appears to be diﬃcult to construct explicit, non-trivial examples
of such models. If we try to continue along the line of harmonic oscillators, perhaps with
some non-harmonic forces added, it seems that the standard Hamiltonian formalism fails
when the time steps are ﬁnite, and if we ﬁnd a Hamiltonian that is conserved, it is usually
not bounded from below. Such models then are unstable; they will not lead to a quantum
description of a model that is stable.
205

In this section, we shall show how to cure this situation, in principle. We concentrate
on the construction of a Hamiltonian principle that keeps a classical energy function E class
exactly conserved in time.
In the multidimensional models, we had adopted the principle that we in turn update
all variables Qi , then all Pi . That has to be done diﬀerently. To obtain better models,
let us phrase our assignment as follows:
Formulate a discrete, classical time evolution law for some model with the following prop-
erties:
i The time evolution operation must be a law that is reversible in time50. Only then
will we have an operator U(δt) that is unitary and as such can be re-written as the
exponent of −i times a hermitean Hamiltonian.
ii There must exist a discrete function E class depending on the dynamical variables
of the theory, that is exactly conserved in time.
iii This quantity E class must be bounded from below.
When these ﬁrst three requirements are met we will be able to map this system on a
quantum mechanical model that may be physically acceptable. But we want more:
iv Our model should be suﬃciently generic, that is, we wish that it features interac-
tions.
v Ideally, it should be possible to identify variables such as our Pi and Qi so that
we can compare our model with systems that are known in physics, where we have
the familiar Hamiltonian canonical variables ⃗p and ⃗q .
vi We would like to have some form of locality; as in the continuum system, our
Hamiltonian should be described as the integral (or sum) of a local Hamiltonian
density, H(⃗x) , and there should exist a small parameter ε > 0 such that at ﬁxed
time t , H(⃗x) only depends on variables located at ⃗x ′ with |⃗x ′ −⃗x| < ε .
The last condition turns our system in some discretised version of a ﬁeld theory ( ⃗P and
⃗Q are then ﬁelds depending on a space coordinate ⃗x and of course on time t ). One might
think that it would be hopeless to fulﬁl all these requirements. Yet there exist beautiful
solutions which we now construct. Let us show how our reasoning goes.
Since we desire an integer-valued energy function that looks like the Hamiltonian of a
continuum theory, we start with a Hamiltonian that we like, being a continuous function
Hcont(⃗q, ⃗p ) and take its integer part, when also ⃗p and ⃗q are integer. More precisely (with
the appropriate factors 2π , as in Eqs. (16.6) and (18.22) in previous chapters): take Pi
50When information loss is allowed, as in section 7 of part I, we shall have to relax this condition.
206

and Qi integer and write51
E class(⃗Q, ⃗P) = 2πH class(⃗Q, ⃗P) ,
H class(⃗Q, ⃗P) = int( 1
2πHcont(⃗Q, 2π ⃗P)) ,
(19.13)
where ‘int’ stands for the integer part, and
Qi = int(qi) ,
Pi = int(pi/2π) ,
for all i .
(19.14)
This gives us a discrete, classical ‘Hamiltonian function’ of the integer degrees of
freedom Pi and Qi . The index i may take a ﬁnite or an inﬁnite number of values ( i is
ﬁnite if we discuss a ﬁnite number of particles, inﬁnite if we consider some version of a
ﬁeld theory).
Soon, we shall discover that not all classical models are suitable for our construction:
ﬁrst of all: the oscillatory solutions must oscillate suﬃciently slowly to stay visible in our
discrete time variable, but, as we shall see, our restrictions will be somewhat more severe
than this.
It will be easy to choose a Hamiltonian obeying these (mild) constraints, but what
are the Hamilton equations? Since we wish to consider discrete time steps ( δt = 1 ), the
equations have to be rephrased with some care. As is the case in the standard Hamiltonian
formalism, the primary objective that our equations of motion have to satisfy is that the
function H(⃗Q, ⃗P) = E class must be conserved. Unlike the standard formalism, however,
the changes in the values ⃗Q and ⃗P at the smallest possible time steps cannot be kept
inﬁnitesimal because both time t and the variables ⃗Q and ⃗P contain integer numbers
only.
The evolution equations will take the shape of a computer program. At integer time
steps with intervals δt , the evolution law will “update” the values of the integer variables
Qi and Pi . Henceforth, we shall use the word “update” in this sense. The entire program
for the updating procedure is our evolution law.
As stated at the beginning of this section, it should be easy to establish such a program:
compute the total energy E of the initial state, H( ⃗Q(0), ⃗P(0) ) = E . Subsequently,
search for all other values of (⃗Q, ⃗P) for which the total energy is the same number.
Together, they form a subspace ΣE of the ⃗Q, ⃗P lattice, which in general may look like a
surface. Just consider the set of points in ΣE , make a mapping (⃗Q, ⃗P) 7→(⃗Q′, ⃗P ′) that
is one-to-one, inside ΣE . This law will be time-reversible and it will conserve the energy.
Just one problem then remains: how do we choose a unique one-to-one mapping?
To achieve this, we need a strategy. Our strategy now will be that we order the values
of the index i in some given way (actually, we will only need a cyclic ordering), and
update the (Q, P) pairs sequentially: ﬁrst the pair (Q1, P1) , then the pair (Q2, P2) ,
and so on, until we arrive at the last value of the index. This sequence of updating every
pair (Qi, Pi) exactly once will be called a cycle. One cycle will deﬁne the smallest step
U op(t, t + δt) for the evolution law.
51Later, in order to maintain some form of locality, we will prefer to take our ‘classical’ Hamiltonian
to be the sum of many integer parts, as in Eq. (19.27), rather than the ﬂoor of the sum of local parts, as
in Eq. (19.13).
207

This reduces our problem to that of updating a single Q, P pair, such that the energy
is conserved. This should be doable. Therefore, let us ﬁrst consider a single Q, P pair.
19.4.1.
One-dimensional system: a single Q, P pair
While concentrating on a single pair, we can drop the index i . The Hamiltonian will be
a function of two integers, Q and P . For demonstration purposes, we restrict ourselves
to the case
H(Q, P) = T(P) + V (Q) + A(Q) B(P) ,
(19.15)
which can be handled for fairly generic choices for the functions T(P), V (Q), A(Q) and
B(P) . The last term here, the product A B , is the lattice generalisation of the magnetic
term ⃗p · ⃗A(⃗q ) in Eq. (19.6). Many interesting physical systems, such as most many body
systems, will be covered by Eq. (19.15). It is possible to choose T(P) = P 2 , or better:
1
2P(P −1) , but V (Q) must be chosen to vary more slowly with Q , otherwise the system
might tend to oscillate too quickly (remember that time is discrete). Often, for sake of
simplicity, we shall disregard the A B term.
The variables Q and P form a two-dimensional lattice. Given the energy E , the
points on this lattice where the energy H(Q, P) = E form a subspace ΣE . We need
to deﬁne a one-to-one mapping of ΣE onto itself. However, since we have just a two-
dimensional lattice of points (Q, P) , we encounter a risk: if the integer H tends to be
too large, it will often happen that there are no other values of Q and P at all that
have the same energy. Then, our system cannot evolve. So, we will ﬁnd out that some
choices of the function H are better than others. In fact, it is not so diﬃcult to see under
what conditions this problem will occur, and how we can avoid it: the integer-valued
Hamiltonian should not vary too wildly with Q and P . What does “too wildly” mean?
If, on a small subset of lattice points, a (Q, P) pair does not move, this may not be
so terrible: when embedded in a larger system, it will move again after the other values
changed. But if there are too many values for the initial conditions where the system will
remain static, we will run into diﬃculties that we wish to avoid. Thus, we demand that
most of the surfaces ΣE contain more than one point on them – preferably more than
two. This means that the functions V (Q) , T(P), A(Q) and B(P) should not be allowed
to be too steep.
We then ﬁnd the desired invertible mapping as follows. First, extrapolate the functions
T, P, A and B to all real values of their variables. Write real numbers q and p as
q = Q + α ,
p = P + β ,
Q and P integer,
0 ≤α ≤1 ,
0 ≤β ≤1 . (19.16)
Then deﬁne the continuous functions
V (q) = (1 −α)V (Q) + αV (Q + 1) ,
T(p) = (1 −β)T(P) + βT(P + 1) , (19.17)
and similarly A(q) and B(p) . Now, the spaces ΣE are given by the lines H(q, p) =
T(p)+V (q)+A(q)B(p) = E , which are now sets of oriented, closed contours, see Fig. 19.

Figure 19: The Q P lattice in the 1+1 dimensional case. Constant energy contours
are here the boundaries of the diﬀerently coloured regions. Points shown in white
are local extrema; they are not on a contour and therefore these are stable rest
points. Black points are saddle points, where two contours are seen to cross one
another. Here, some unique evolution prescriptions must be phrased, such as: “stick
to your right”, and it must be speciﬁed which of the two contours contains the black
dot. All these exceptional points are related to local minima ( −) and maxima ( + )
of the functions T and V .
They are of course the same closed contours as in the standard, continuum Hamiltonian
formalism.
The standard Hamiltonian formalism would now dictate how fast our system runs
along one of these contours. We cannot quite follow that prescription here, because at
t = integer we wish P and Q to take integer values, that is, they have to be at one of
the lattice sites. But the speed of the evolution does not aﬀect the fact that energy is
conserved. Therefore we modify this speed, by now postulating that
at every time step t →t + δt , the system moves to the next lattice site that is
on its contour ΣE .
If there is only one point on the contour, which would be the state at time t , then nothing
moves. If there are two points, the system ﬂip-ﬂops, and the orientation of the contour
is immaterial. If there are more than two points, the system is postulated to move in the
same direction along the contour as in the standard Hamiltonian formalism. In Fig. 19,
we see examples of contours with just one point, and contours with two or more points
on them. Only if there is more than one point, the evolution will be non-trivial.
209

In some cases, there will be some ambiguity. Precisely at the lattice sites, our curves
will be non-diﬀerentiable because the functions T, C, A, and B are non-diﬀerentiable
there. This gives sone slight complications in particular when we reach extreme values
for both T(P) and V (q) . If both reach a maximum or both a minimum, the contour
shrinks to a point and the system cannot move.
If one reaches a minimum and the
other a maximum, we have a saddle point, and some extra rules must be added. We
could demand that the contours “have to be followed to the right”, but we also have
to state which of the two contours will have to be followed if we land on such a point;
also, regarding time reversal, we have to state which of the two contours has the lattice
point on it, and which just passes by. Thus, we can make the evolution law unique and
reversible. See Fig. 19. The fact that there are a few (but not too many) stationary points
is not problematic if this description is applied to formulate the law for multi-dimensional
systems, see section 19.4.2.
Clearly, this gives us the classical orbit in the correct temporal order, but the reader
might be concerned about two things: one, what if there is only one point on our contour,
the point where we started from, and two, we have the right time ordering, but do we
have the correct speed? Does this updating procedure not go too fast or too slowly, when
compared to the continuum limit?
As for the ﬁrst question, we will have no choice but postulating that, if there is only
one point on a contour, that point will be at rest, our system does not evolve. Later, we
shall ﬁnd estimates on how many of such points one might expect.
Let us ﬁrst concentrate on the second question. How fast will this updating procedure
go? how long will it take, on average, to circle one contour? Well, clearly, the discrete
period T of a contour will be equal to the number of points on a contour (with the
exception of a single point, where things do not move52). How many points do we expect
to ﬁnd on one contour?

approximately linearises:
H class ≈a P + b Q + C ,
(19.18)
with small corrections that ensure that H class is an integer on all lattice points. With a
little bit of geometry, one ﬁnds a tilted square with sides of length ε
√
a2 + b2 , where the
values of H class vary between values C and C +K , with K = ε(a2+b2) . Assuming that
all these integers occur at about the same rate, we ﬁnd that the total number of lattice
sites inside the square is ε2(a2 + b2) , and since there are K contours, every contour has,
on average,
ε2(a2 + b2)/K = ε
(19.19)
points on it. The lengths of the contours in Figure 20 is ε
√
a2 + b2 , so that, on average,
the distance between two points on a contour is
√
a2 + b2 .

(19.20)
completely in accordance with the standard Hamilton equations! (Note that the factors
2π in Eqs. (19.13) and (19.14) cancel out)
A deeper mathematical reason why our discrete lattice Hamiltonian formalism gen-
erates the same evolution speed as the continuum theory may be traced to the Liouville
theorem: a co-moving inﬁnitesimal volume element in (p, q) -space stays constant in the
continuum theory; in the discrete lattice case, time reversibility ensures that the number
of lattice points inside a small volume on the lattice stays ﬁxed, so that we have the same
Liouville theorem on the lattice. When increasing values for the partial derivatives of the
Hamiltonian cause a squeezing of the inﬁnitesimal volume elements, both the continuum
theory and the lattice theory require the same increase in the velocities to keep the volume
elements constant.
One concludes that our updating procedure exactly leads to the correct continuum
limit. However, the Hamiltonian must be suﬃciently smooth so as to have more than one
point on a contour. We now know that this must mean that the continuous motion in
the continuum limit cannot be allowed to be too rapid. We expect that, on the discrete
lattice, the distance between consecutive lattice points on a contour may vary erratically,
so that the motion will continue with a variable speed. In the continuum limit, this must
average out to a smooth motion, completely in accordance with the standard Hamilton
equations.
Returning to the question of the contours with only one point on them, we expect
their total lengths, on average, to be such that their classical periods would correspond
to a single time unit δt . These periods will be too fast to monitor on our discrete time
scale.
211

This completes our brief analysis of the 1+1 dimensional case. We found an evolution
law that exactly preserves the discrete energy function chosen. The procedure is unique as
soon as the energy function can be extended naturally to a continuous function between
the lattice sites, as was realised in the case H = T +V +AB in Eq. (19.17). Furthermore
we must require that the energy function does not vary too steeply, so that most of the
closed contours contain more than one lattice point.
An interesting test case is the choice
T(P) = 1
2P(P −1) ;
V (Q) = 1
2Q(Q −1) ,
(19.21)
This is a discretised harmonic oscillator whose period is not exactly constant, but this one
is easier to generalise to higher dimensions than the oscillator described in section 17.2
and subsection 19.3.1.
19.4.2.
The multi dimensional case
A single particle in 1 space- and 1 time dimension, as described in the previous section,
is rather boring, since the motion occurs on contours that all have rather short periods
(indeed, in the harmonic oscillator, where both T and V are quadratic functions of their
variables, such as in Eq. (19.21), the period will stay close to the fundamental time step
δt itself). In higher dimensions (and in multi component oscillators, particularly when
they have non-linear interactions), this will be quite diﬀerent. So now, we consider the
variables Qi, Pi, i = 1, · · · , n . Again, we postulate a Hamiltonian H(⃗Q, ⃗P ) that, when
Pi and Qi are integer, takes integer values only. Again, let us take the case that
H(⃗Q, ⃗P ) = T(⃗P ) + V (⃗Q ) + A(⃗Q ) B(⃗P ) .
(19.22)
To describe an energy conserving evolution law, we simply can apply the procedure de-
scribed in the previous section n times for each cycle. For a unique description, it is now
mandatory that we introduce a cyclic ordering for the values 1, · · · , n that the index i
can take. Naturally, we adopt the notation of the values for the index i to whatever
ordering might have been chosen:
1 < 2 < · · · < n < 1 · · · .
(19.23)
We do emphasise that the procedure described next depends on this ordering.
Let U op
i
be our notation for the operation in one dimension, acting on the variables
Qi, Pi at one given value for the index i . Thus, U op
i
maps (Pi, Qi) 7→(P ′
i, Q′
i) using
the procedure of section 19.4.1 with the Hamiltonian (19.22), simply keeping all other
variables Qj, Pj, j ̸= i ﬁxed. By construction, U op
i
has an inverse U op −1
i
. Now, it is
simple to produce a prescription for the evolution U op for the entire system, for a single
time step δt = 1 :
U op(δt) = U op
n U op
n−1 · · · U op
1
.
(19.24)
where we intend to use the physical notation: U op
1
acts ﬁrst, then U op
2 , etc., although the
opposite order can also be taken. Note, that we have some parity violation: the operators
212

U op
i
and U op
j
will not commute if i ̸= j , and therefore, if n ≥3 , the resulting operator
U op is not quite the same as the one obtained when the order is reversed.
Time inversion gives:
U op(−δt) = U op −1(δt) = U op −1
1
U op −1
2
· · · U op −1
n
.
(19.25)
Finally, if the exchange U op
i
↔U op −1
i
might be associated with “particle-antiparticle
conjugation”, C , then the product P (parity) T (time inversion) C (conjugation) may
still be a good symmetry. In the real world, this might lead to a natural explanation of
CPT symmetry, while P , T , or CP are not respected.
19.4.3.
The Lagrangian
It was emphasised by Elze [65] that systems with a discrete Hamiltonian should also have
an action principle. If both time as well as the variables P and Q are discrete, one could
consider Lagrangians such as
L(t) ?= 1
2P(t)(Q(t + 1) −Q(t −1)) −H(P(t), Q(t)) ,
S =
X
t∈Z
L(t) .
(19.26)
This, however, would lead to Lagrange equations that are ﬁnite diﬀerence equations, at
best, while they would no longer guarantee conservation of energy. Some Lagrangians may
exist that are purely quadratic in the integers P and Q , but, as we saw, this would be
too strong a restriction that excludes any non-trivial theory. At this moment we have no
proposal for a Lagrange principle that works as well as our discrete Hamilton formalism.
19.4.4.
Discrete ﬁeld theories
An important example of an inﬁnite-dimensional (Qi, Pi) system is a local ﬁeld theory.
Suppose that the index i is replaced by a lattice coordinate ⃗x , plus possibly other indices
j labelling species of ﬁelds. Let us rename the variables (Φj(⃗x ), Pj(⃗x )) , where Φj are
canonical ﬁelds and Pj are their momentum variables (often, in the continuum theory,
d
dtΦj ). Now assume that the Hamiltonian of the entire system is the sum of local terms:
H int =
X
⃗x
H int(⃗x ) ,
H int(⃗x ) = V (⃗Φ(⃗x ), ⃗Φ(⃗x ′)) + T(⃗P(⃗x )) ,
(19.27)
where the coordinates ⃗x ′ are limited to neighbours of ⃗x only, and all functions V and
T are integers. This would be a typical discretisation of a (classical or quantum) ﬁeld
theory (ignoring, for simplicity, magnetic terms).
We can apply our multi-dimensional, discrete Hamiltonian equations to this case, but
there is one important thing to remember: where in the previous subsections we stated
that the indices i must be cyclically ordered, this now means that, in the ﬁeld theory of
Eq. (19.27), not only the indices i but also the coordinates ⃗x must be (cyclically) ordered.
The danger of this is that the functions Vi(⃗x ) also refer to neighbours, and, consequently,
213

the evolution step deﬁned at point ⃗x aﬀects the evolution at its neighbouring points ⃗x ′ ,
or:
[U op(⃗x ), U op(⃗x ′ )] ̸= 0 . Performing the updates in the order of the values of the
coordinates ⃗x , might therefore produce signals that move much faster than light, possibly
generating instantaneous non local eﬀects across the entire system over a single time step
t →t + δt . This we need to avoid, and there happens to be an easy way to do this:
First make sure that the interaction terms in the Hamiltonian only involve
nearest neighbours, The evolution equations (e.o.m.)
of the entire system
over one time step δt , are then obtained by ordering the coordinates and
other indices as follows: ﬁrst update all even lattice sites, then update all odd
lattice sites.
Since the U op operators generated by Hi(⃗x ) do commute with the evolution operators
U op(⃗x ′ ) when ⃗x and ⃗x ′ are both on an even site or both on an odd site of the lattice (so
that they are not nearest neighbours), this ordering does not pass on signals beyond two
lattice links. Moreover, there is another huge advantage of this law: the order in which
the individual even sites of the lattice are updated is now immaterial, and the same for
the set of all odd sites.
Thus, we obtained a cellular automaton whose evolution law is of the type
U op = Aop Bop ,
Aop =
Y
⃗x = even
Aop(⃗x) ,
Bop =
Y
⃗y = odd
Bop(⃗y) ,
(19.28)
where the order inside the products over the sites ⃗x and ⃗y is immaterial, except that
Aop(⃗x) and Bop(⃗y) do not commute when ⃗x and ⃗y are direct neighbours. Such automata
are interesting objects to be studied, see chapter 21.
19.4.5.
From the integer valued to the quantum Hamiltonian
A deterministic system obeying a discrete Hamiltonian formalism as described in the
previous sections is of particular interest when we map it onto a quantum system following
the program discussed in this book. This is because we here have two diﬀerent operators
that both play the role of energy: we have the integer valued, discrete Hamiltonian H class
that generates the classical equations of motion, and we have the angular, or fractional
valued Hamiltonian H quant , deﬁned from the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the one-time
step evolution operator U op(δt) :
U op(δt) = e−iHop
quant ,
0 ≤H quant < 2π
(δt = 1) ,
(19.29)
where H quant refers to the eigenvalues of the operator Hop
quant .
As anticipated in section 19.4, we can now uniquely deﬁne a total Hamiltonian that
is a real number operator, by
H = H class + Hop
quant .
(19.30)
214

The bounds imposed in Eq. (19.29) are important to keep in mind, since H quant , as
deﬁned, is strictly periodic. H class is assumed to take only integer values, times 2π/δt .
In this section we study the quantum theory deﬁned by the Hamiltonian (19.30).
We have seen, for instance in chapter 2, subsection 2.2.1, Eq. 2.26 in part I, and in
chapter 12, section 12.2, Eq. 12.10 in part II, how the operator Hop
quant can be calculated
from the eigenvalues U(δt) of the operator U op(δt) : for instance by Fourier transforma-
tions, one derives that, if the eigenvalues of H quant are assumed to lie between 0 and 2π ,
then
Hop
quant
=
π −
∞
X
n−1
i
n ( U op(n δt) −U op(−n δt) ) .
(19.31)
This sum converges nearly everywhere, but the vacuum is the edge state where the equa-
tion does not hold, and it is not quite local, since the evolution operator over n steps in
time, also acts over n steps in space.
But both H class and H quant are uniquely deﬁned, and since H quant is bound to an
interval while H class is bounded from below, also H is bounded from below.
Note that demanding a large number of low energy states near the vacuum (the absence
of a large mass gap) implies that U op(n δt) be non-trivial in the H class = 0 sector. This
is often not the case in the models described in subsection 19.4.2, but in principle there is
no reason why such models should not exist also. In fact, some of the cellular automaton
models discussed later in chapter 21 have no manifestly conserved H class , so that all their
states can be regarded as sitting in the H class = 0 sector of the theory.
Because of the non-locality of Eq. (19.31), the Hamiltonian (19.31) does not obey the
rule vi , but if U op(δt) is the product of local evolution operators, the evolution over
integer time steps n δt is local, so the theory can be claimed to obey locality, as long as
we refrain from deﬁning its states at time t when t is not an integer.53
As we have seen in section 14, the sum (19.31) does not converge rapidly everywhere
in Hilbert space. We are particularly interested in the Hamiltonian as it acts on states
very close to the vacuum, in our notation: H class = 0,
H quant = ω , where 0 < ω ≪2π .
Suppose then that we introduce a cut-oﬀin the sum (19.31) (or 12.8) by multiplying the
summand with e−n/R , where R is also the range of non-locality of the last signiﬁcant
terms of the sum. As we have seen in section 14, breaking oﬀthe expansion at the point
R modiﬁes the Hamiltonian as follows:
H quant →H quant +
2
R H quant
,
(19.32)
and this is only acceptable if
R ≫MPl/⟨H quant⟩2 .
(19.33)
53Some have tried to shoot down our theories by objecting that our classical/quantum equivalence only
holds for integer times. Of course we simply point out then that, if we restrict ourselves to suﬃciently
low energies, the time-variability is suﬃciently slow that having an equation that only holds rigorously
at integer multiples of δt is all we need.
215

Here, MPl is the “Planck mass”, or whatever the inverse is of the elementary time scale
in the model. This cut-oﬀradius R must therefore be chosen to be very large, so that,
indeed, the exact quantum description of our local model generates non-locality in the
Hamiltonian.
We conclude that the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of local terms, but we
need to include the operators U op(±∆t) where ∆t is large compared to the inverse of the
Hamiltonian we wish to calculate. These will develop non localities that are still serious.
This is still an obstacle against the construction of a local quantum Hamiltonian density
(the classical component, H class obeys condition vi). As yet, therefore, more has to be
done to obtain locality: second quantisation.
The apparent locality clash between the quantum Hamiltonian and the classical theory
may well be looked upon as a possible additional explanation of the apparent non-localities
expected in ‘hidden variable’ theories: neither the pure quantum system that we usually
employ in quantum ﬁeld theories, nor the associated classical system exhibit any non-
locality, but the mapping between them does. This non-locality is spurious, it has no
physical consequence whatsoever, but mathematically it may imply that the quantum
system should not be split up into local wave functions that do not communicate with
each other – perhaps that is the route along which apparent non-locality arises in classical
mechanical models.
There is no non-locality in the classical theory, but it is in the
representation of the quantum variables, or: the classical - quantum mapping.
20.
Quantum Field Theory
In this chapter, we give a brief summary of the features of quantum ﬁeld theory that we
shall need to understand in this book.
We have seen that producing quantum Schr¨odinger equations starting from non quan-
tum mechanical systems is essentially straightforward. However, to employ this observa-
tion as a viable ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics, more is needed. The
main objection against these concepts has always been that quantum theories obeying
locality in the quantum sense, are much more diﬃcult to reproduce with classical systems
obeying locality in the classical sense, and impossible according to many.
Locality means that interaction at a distance can only occur with signals that undergo
some delay. Locality in the classical sense here means that the classical evolution laws are
based on interactions with neighbouring sites only, in such a way that information cannot
spread faster than the speed of light. Locality in the quantum sense means the same
thing, except that we allow for any kind of quantum mechanical interactions between
neighbouring sites. If Oi(x) is an operator only depending on fundamental variables in
the immediate vicinity of a space-time point x , enumerated by an index i , then quantum
locality means that the commutation property
[Oi(x), Oj(x′)] = 0 ,
(20.1)
216

holds as soon as the two space-time points x and x′ are space-like separated:
(x −x′)2 ≡(⃗x −⃗x ′)2 −c2(t −t′)2 > 0 .
(20.2)
The relativistic quantised ﬁeld theories employed in the Standard Model are indeed
strictly local in the quantum mechanical sense, obeying Eqs. (20.1), (20.2). It is important
to recall here the essential features of these systems. A point to be made right-away is,
that quantum ﬁeld theories are quite complicated. This is partly due to the fact that we
usually want special relativity to be valid, which is a diﬃcult – while highly interesting
– demand. But even without special relativity, there are some fairly intricate issues such
as second quantisation, perturbation theory, inﬁnities, renormalisation, symmetries and
anomalies. This is why the topic of this book is actually quite diﬃcult: not only are
we attempting to derive quantum mechanics from scratch, but also (fully renormalised)
quantum ﬁeld theory.
Relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories with a proper continuum limit can only incorporate
elementary ﬁelds with spin 0,
1
2 and 1. As is well-known, gravity would be propagated
by gravitons with spin 2, and supergravity would add one or more gravitino species with
spin
3/2 , but then, if we want these ﬁelds to interact, we would have to be close to the
Planck scale, and this would require discretisation due to micro states. Since ordinary
quantum ﬁeld theories assume strict continuity, they only apply to the continuum limit,
which implies that we can safely omit spin 2 and spin
3/2 ﬁelds in those theories. The
way this works in quantum ﬁeld theory is that, at the Standard Model scales, interactions
with gravitons and gravitinos are extremely weak.
On the other hand, one could argue that also special relativity is not our ﬁrst priority,
and ignoring special relativity would imply no rigorous constraint on spin. If we ignore
special as well as general relativity, we could just as well ignore rotation invariance54.
What is left then is a theory of quantised ﬁelds enumerated by an index that may or may
not represent spin. Later we may wish to reinstate Poincar´e invariance, at least at the
quantum side of the equation, but this will have to be left as an important exercise for
the (hopefully near) future.
What we want to keep is a speed limit for signals that describe interactions, so that
the notion of locality can be addressed. In practice, an elegant criterion can be given that
guarantees this kind of locality. Consider the quantum system in its Heisenberg notation.
We have operators Oi(⃗x, t) where both the space coordinates ⃗x and the time coordinate
t may be either continuous or discrete. The discrete index i enumerates diﬀerent types
of operators.
When our operator ﬁelds obey quantum locality, Eqs. (20.1) and (20.2), in the con-
tinuous case, this means that the Hamiltonian must be the integral of a Hamiltonian
54Ignoring such important symmetries in considering certain models does not mean that we believe these
symmetries to be violated, but rather that we wish to focus on simple models where these symmetries
do not, or not yet, play a role. In more sophisticated theories of Nature, of course one has to obey all
known symmetry requirements.

density:
H =
Z
d3⃗x H(⃗x, t) ,
[ H(⃗x, t) , H(⃗x ′, t)] = 0
if
⃗x ̸= ⃗x ′ ,
(20.3)
while, when x →x′ , the commutator [ H(⃗x, t) , H(⃗x ′, t) ] , may contain derivatives of
Dirac delta distributions. Note that, here, we kept equal times t so that these space-time
points are space-like separated unless they coincide.
On a discrete space-like lattice, it is tempting to replace Eqs. (20.3) by the lattice
expressions
H =
X
⃗x
H(⃗x, t) ,
[H(⃗x,′ , t), H(⃗x ′, t)] = 0
if
|⃗x −⃗x ′| > a,
(20.4)
where a is the link size of the lattice. The Hamiltonian densities at neighbouring sites,
|⃗x −⃗x ′| = a , will, in general, not commute. Although Eqs. (20.4) may well serve as a
good deﬁnition of locality, they do not guarantee that signals are subject to a speed limit.
Only in the continuum limit, one may recover commutation at space-like separations,
(20.2), if special relativity holds (in that limit).
Cellular automata are typically lattice theories. In general, these theories are diﬃcult
to reconcile with Lorentz invariance. This does not mean that we plan to give up Lorentz
invariance; quite possibly, this important symmetry will be recovered at some stage. But
since we want to understand quantum mechanics as a reﬂection of discreteness at a scale
comparable to the Planck scale, we are unable at present to keep Lorentz invariance in
our models, so this price is paid, hopefully temporarily.
For simplicity, let us now return our attention to continuum quantum ﬁeld theories,
which we can either force to be Lorentz invariant, or replace by lattice versions at some
later stage. The present chapter is included here just to emphasise some important fea-
tures.
20.1.
General continuum theories – the bosonic case
Let the ﬁeld variables be real number operators Φi(⃗x, t) and their canonical conjugates
Pi(⃗x, t) . Here, i is a discrete index counting independent ﬁelds. The commutation rules
are postulated to be
[Φi(⃗x, t), Φj(⃗x ′, t)]
=
[Pi(⃗x, t), Pj(⃗x ′, t)] = 0 ,
[Φi(⃗x, t), Pj(⃗x ′, t)]
=
i δij δ3(⃗x −⃗x ′)
(20.5)
(for simplicity, space was taken to be 3-dimensional).
In bosonic theories, when writing the Hamiltonian as
H =
Z
d⃗x H(⃗x) ,
(20.6)
218

the Hamiltonian density H(⃗x) typically takes a form such as
H(⃗x) =
X
i

1
2P 2
i (⃗x) + 1
2(⃗∂Φi(⃗x))2 + V (⃗Φ(⃗x))

.
(20.7)
If we are in 3+1 dimensions, and we want the theory to be renormalizable, V (⃗Φ(⃗x)) must
be a polynomial function of ⃗Φ , of degree 4 or lower. Typically, one starts with
V (⃗Φ) = 1
2
X
i
m2
i ⃗Φ2
i + V4(⃗Φ) ,
(20.8)
where mi are the (unrenormalized) masses of the particles of type i , and V4 is a homo-
geneous quartic expression in the ﬁelds ⃗Φi(⃗x) such as a self interaction
1
4!λΦ4 .
However, when ⃗Φ(⃗x) contains components that form a vector in 3-space, Lorentz-
invariance dictates a deviation from Eq. (20.7). We then have local gauge invariance,
which implies that a constraint has to be imposed. Writing these vector ﬁelds as ⃗A(⃗x) ,
and their associated momentum ﬁelds as ⃗E(⃗x) , one is forced to include a time component
A0(⃗x) .
Gauge-invariance must then be invoked to ensure that locality and unitarity of the
theory are not lost, but the resulting Hamiltonian deviates a bit from Eq. (20.7). This
deviation is minimal if we choose the space-like radiation gauge
3
X
i=1
∂iAi(⃗x) = 0 ,
(20.9)
since then the Hamiltonian will have the quadratic terms
H2(⃗x) = 1
2 ⃗E2(⃗x) + 1
2(⃗∂Ai(⃗x))2 −1
2(⃗∂A0(⃗x))2 .
(20.10)
In addition, one might have linear terms,
HJ(⃗x) = ⃗J(⃗x) · ⃗A(⃗x) + ϱ(⃗x)A0(⃗x) ,
H ≡H2 + HJ + H int ,
(20.11)
where ⃗J and ϱ are some given background functions. ⃗J(⃗x) is a current density and ϱ(⃗x)
a charge density. In a relativistic theory, ⃗J and ϱ form a 4-vector. All remaining terms
in the Hamiltonian, typically higher powers of the ﬁelds, which may cause interactions
among particles to occur, are collected in H int .
Notably, the ﬁeld A0(⃗x) does not have a canonical partner that would have been
called E0(⃗x) , and therefore, the ﬁeld A0 can be eliminated classically, by extremising
the Hamiltonian H =
R
d⃗x H(⃗x) , which leads to the Coulomb force between the sources
ϱ . This Coulomb force is instantaneous in time, and would have destroyed locality (and
hence Lorentz invariance) if we did not have local gauge invariance.
This, of course, is a description of quantised ﬁeld theories in a nut shell, as yet only for
bosonic particles. How then the Schr¨odinger equation is solved by perturbation expansion
219

in powers of the coupling constant(s) λ and/or gauge coupling parameters g , is well-
known and discussed in the standard text books. [29][66][83]
The most important point we need to emphasise is that the above formulation of
quantised ﬁeld theories is easy to replace by discretised versions. All we need to do is
replace the partial derivatives ∂i = ∂/∂xi by lattice derivatives:
∂iΦ(⃗x) →1
a

Φ(⃗x + ⃗eia) −Φ(⃗x)

,
(20.12)
where a is the lattice link size, and ⃗ei is the unit vector along a lattice link in the i
direction. The continuum limit, a ↓0 , seems to be deceptively easy to take; in partic-
ular, renormalization will now only lead to ﬁnite correction terms. Note however, that
symmetries such as rotation symmetry and Lorentz invariance will be lost. Recovering
such symmetries in more sophisticated models (without taking a continuum limit) is be-
yond our abilities just now – but notice that our treatment of string theory, section 17.3,
appears to be heading in the right direction.
20.2.
Fermionic ﬁeld theories
Fermionic ﬁeld systems are also an essential element in the Standard Model. The funda-
mental variables are the Dirac ﬁelds ψi(⃗x) and their canonical associates ψ†
i (⃗x) . They
are spinor ﬁelds, so that i contains a spinor index. The ﬁelds anti-commute. The anti-
commutation rules are
{ψ†
i (⃗x), ψj(⃗x ′)} = δijδ(⃗x −⃗x ′) ,
{ψi, ψj} = {ψ†
i , ψ†
j} = 0 ,
(20.13)
where {a, b} ≡ab + ba . Note, that these rules are typical for operators of the form (0 1
0 0)
and (0 0
1 0) , so these rules mean that ψi(⃗x) is to be regarded as an operator that annihilates
an object i at position ⃗x , and ψ†
i (⃗x) creates one. The rules imply that ψ2
i (⃗x) = 0 and
(ψ†
i (⃗x))2 = 0 , so that we cannot create or annihilate two objects i at the same spot ⃗x .
A state containing two (or more) particles of diﬀerent type, and/or at diﬀerent positions
⃗x , will always be antisymmetric under interchange of two such fermions, which is Pauli’s
principle.
In conventional quantum ﬁeld theory, one now proceeds to the Lagrange formalism,
which works magniﬁcently for doing fast calculations of all sorts. For our purpose, how-
ever, we need the Hamiltonian. The quantum Hamiltonian density for a fermionic ﬁeld
theory is (compare section 15.2):
HF(⃗x) = ψ (m + W(⃗Φ) + ⃗γ · ⃗∂) ψ ,
(20.14)
where W(⃗Φ) stands short for the Yukawa interaction terms that we may expect, and
ψ = ψ†γ4 .
The matrices γµ, µ = 1, 2, 3, 4 , need to obey the usual anti-commutation rule
{γµ, γν} = 2δµν ,
(20.15)
220

which requires them to be at least 4 × 4 matrices, so that the spinors are 4 dimensional.
One can, however, reduce these to 2 component spinors, called Majorana spinors, by using
a constraint such as
ψ = C ˜ψ = C˜γ4ψ† ,
ψ† = C∗γ4 ψ ,
(20.16)
where ˜ stands for transposition, and C is a spinor matrix obeying 55, 56
γµC = −Cγ∗
µ ,
C†C = 1 ,
C = C† .
(20.17)
Just as in the bosonic case, we may consider replacing the continuum in space by a
space-like lattice, using expressions such as Eq. (20.12), at the price of (hopefully tem-
porarily) giving up Lorentz invariance.
The Yukawa term W(Φ) in Eq. (20.14) may include interactions with gauge ﬁelds in
the usual way. The question addressed in this work is to what extent Hamiltonians such
as the sum of Eqs. (20.7) and (20.14) can be obtained from deterministic theories.
20.3.
Standard second quantisation
Accurate calculations in ﬁeld theories for interacting particles are practically impossible
without a systematic approximation procedure of some sort. The most eﬃcient approx-
imation scheme used is that of the perturbation expansion in terms of powers of all
interaction parameters. This works because, when the interaction terms vanish, the ﬁelds
will obey linear ﬁeld equations, which are trivial to solve.
These linear equations happen to coincide with the linear Schr¨odinger equations obeyed
by single particle states. It is as if the wave functions
|φi(⃗x, t)⟩,
|ψi(⃗x, t)⟩
and their
associated bra states are replaced by classical ontological ﬁelds Φi(⃗x, t), ψi(⃗x, t) and their
canonical conjugates, after which the quantisation procedure is applied to these ﬁelds yet
again, replacing Poisson brackets by commutators or anticommutators. This explains the
term “second quantisation” by which this procedure is known.
In fact it is not hard to show that the complete Hilbert space of all quantum states of
the quantised ﬁeld system (20.5) and (20.13) can be described as the product space of all
sets of multi particle states that can be formed out of the ‘single-quantised’ particles.
Then, however, one has to insert the interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. We write
H = H0 + ∆H0 + H int + ∆H int ,
(20.18)
where H0 = H2 + HJ is the bilinear part of H , and H int contains the higher powers
of the ﬁelds, causing interactions.
∆H0 and ∆H int are extra terms that are of the
55In section 15.2, we also used 2 dimensional spinors.
The two-component spinor ﬁeld used there
is obtained by using one of the projection operators P± =
1
2(1 ± γ5) . The mass term can be made
compatible with that.
56The reason why Dirac needed a four-dimensional representation is that the constraint (20.16) would
not allow coupling to an electromagnetic ﬁeld since this would violate gauge-invariance (in particular the
mass term).
221

same form as H0 and H int themselves, but they are taken care of at later stages of
the perturbation expansion, just for technical reasons (renormalization). This is how one
begins to set up perturbation theory.
Now, in relativistic quantum theories, the single-quantised free particles have energy
spectra that take the form E = ±
p
p2 + m2 (for bosons), or E = ⃗α · ⃗p + β m (for
fermions; αi and β are the Dirac matrices). This implies that the energies of single
particles appear to be unbounded from below. The beauty of the second-quantised theory
is that we can replace negative-energy particles by holes of positive energy antiparticles.
This automatically ensures a lower bound for the total Hamiltonian.
For the case of fermions, it is easy to accept the idea that negative energy particles
have to be regarded as holes in the sea of antiparticles, because Pauli’s exclusion prin-
ciple forbids the presence of more than one particle in any energy level. In the case of
bosons, the situation becomes clear if we regard every mode of the energy spectrum as a
harmonic oscillator, controlled by creation and annihilation operators. Its energy is also
bounded from below. Note that, in terms of the quantum ﬁeld variables Φ and ψ , the
Hamiltonian was non-negative by construction – if one disregards the complications due
to renormalization.
Thus, the second quantisation procedure restores a lower bound to the Hamiltonian,
simply by allowing indeﬁnite numbers of particles. We can allow the same mechanism to
work for a cellular automaton, if the automaton also can be described in terms of particles.
A particle hops over a grid of points in 3-space, and its evolution operator generates a
Hamiltonian that may be unbounded from below. Second quantisation now means that
we allow for the presence of indeﬁnite numbers of these particles, which may either behave
as fermions or as bosons. The particle - antiparticle procedure then ensures positivity of
the total Hamiltonian.
20.4.
Perturbation theory
How to compute the eﬀects of these Hamiltonians in perturbation theory, such as mass
spectra, cross sections and lifetimes of the quantised particles that it contains, is standard
text material, and not the subject of this treatise, but we do need to know about some
essential features for our further discussion.
Split up the Hamiltonian into a “free” part H0 and the various interaction parts, as in
Eq. (20.18), where the free part only contains terms that are bilinear in the ﬁeld variables
Φi(⃗x), Pi(⃗x), ψi(⃗x) and ψi(⃗x) (possibly after having shifted some of the ﬁelds by a vac-
uum value, such as in the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism). The interaction Hamiltonian
H int may also contain bilinear terms, here written as ∆H0 , needed to renormalize di-
vergent eﬀective interactions. There is some freedom as to whether we put parts of these
so-called counter terms in H0 or in ∆H0 , and how to split the interaction terms in H int
and ∆H int , which in fact is a choice concerning the book keeping process of the pertur-
bative expansion. The fact that ﬁnal results of the calculation should be independent of
these choices is an important ingredient of what is called the renormalization group of the
theory (see section 20.8).
222

H int is assumed to depend on the coupling parameters λi, gi, etc., of the theory,
such that H int vanishes if these parameters are set to zero.
As already mentioned in section 20.1, the analysis is facilitated by the introduction of
auxiliary terms in the Hamiltonian, called source terms, which are linear in the ﬁelds:
HJ(⃗x, t) =
X
i
Ji(⃗x, t)Φi(⃗x) +
X
i
ηi(⃗x, t)ψi(⃗x) +
X
i
ψi(⃗x)ηi(⃗x, t) ,
(20.19)
where the “source functions” Ji(⃗x, t), ηi(⃗x, t) and ηi(⃗x, t) are freely chosen functions of
space and time, to be replaced by zero at the end of the computation (the time dependence
is not explicitly mentioned here in the ﬁeld variables, but, in a Heisenberg representation,
of course also the ﬁelds are time dependent).
These source terms could serve as simple models for the creation of the initial particles
in a scattering experiment, as well as the detection process for the particles in the ﬁnal
state, but they can also simply be regarded as useful devices for a mathematical analysis of
the physical properties of the system. One can then ﬁnd all amplitudes one needs to know,
by computing at any desired order in perturbation theory, that is, up to certain powers
of the coupling parameters and the source functions, the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude:
t=∞⟨∅| ∅⟩t=−∞= 1 −i

R R
d4xd4x′ Ji(x)Jj(x′) Pij(x −x′) +

6
R R R
d4xd4x′d4x′′ Wijk(x, x′, x′′)Ji(x)Jj(x′)Jk(x′′) + · · · ,
(20.20)
where x stands short for the space-time coordinates (⃗x, t) , and the correlation functions
Pij(x −x′), Wijk(x, x′, x′′) and many more terms of the sequence are to be calculated.
Physically, this means that we compute expectation values of the products of operators
Φi(⃗x, t), ψi(⃗x, t) and ψi(⃗x, t) of Eq. (20.19) in a Heisenberg representation. Local prod-
ucts of these operators also follow from the expressions (20.20), if we take space-time
points x and x′ to coincide.
The algorithm for the calculation of the two-point functions P , the three-point func-
tions W , etc., is conveniently summarised in the so-called Feynman rules, for which we
refer to the standard text books. [36][66][83]
20.4.1.
Non-convergence of the coupling constant expansion
There are some conditions where particles interact strongly. Quarks are fermionic particles
that interact so strongly that the forces between them keep them permanently bound in
hadrons, the so-called quark conﬁnement mechanism. This, however, only happens at
the distance scale of the Standard Model, When extrapolated to the Planck scale, these
strong interactions have been calculated to be about as weak as the other forces, notably
electromagnetism and the weak force. This means that, in a conveniently large domain
near the Planck scale, all perturbation expansions may be rapidly convergent: there, one
never needs to know the very high-order perturbative correction terms, since these are
many times smaller than the usual margins of error in our description of the dynamics.
It now so happens that, when we apply second quantisation in our cellular automaton
models, something very similar may happen. If we choose our interactions to originate
223

from rare coincidences in the cellular conﬁgurations, then most of the interaction events
may be far separated at the Planck scale. This may imply that we have freely moving
particles interacting only weakly by means of an interaction Hamiltonian.
Since this
Hamiltonian starts out to be local, only a few higher order calculations may suﬃce to
obtain an accurate description of the dynamics.
We can now consider combining the quantum ﬁeld theoretic perturbation expansion
with the expansion needed to generate the interaction Hamiltonian itself. The result-
ing theory will still be accurate in the domain close to the Planck scale. Our proposal
is to start from this theory, and to apply the usual renormalization group procedures
(section 20.8) to transform everything to the Standard Model scale.
20.5.
The algebraic structure of the general, renormalizable, relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theory
The reasons for limiting ourselves to renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theories are not com-
pletely obvious. When coupling strengths become large, renormalizable ﬁeld theories may
generate poles where the perturbation expansion diverges. We call these Landau poles.
Renormalization is then of little help. The renormalization group (section 20.8) explains
how the Landau poles can arise. If a Landau pole emerges in the small-distance domain,
one has to conclude that the renormalization procedure fails, and here is little one can do
about this. If however a Landau pole is related to a large distance divergence, it can be
attributed to non-canonical behaviour of the force ﬁelds at large distances, which can be
investigated and understood.
Landau poles do also occur when the couplings are weak, but since they are non-
perturbative eﬀects, these poles retreat to very distant domains of extremely high energies,
so that they quickly turn harmless. This is the case where, by demanding renormalizabil-
ity, we can select out a precisely deﬁned class of models that are mathematically accurate,
and most useful for comparison with experiments. They are not inﬁnitely accurate, but,
as we shall see in section 22.1, also the procedure that we can use to derive a ﬁeld theory
out of a cellular automaton, will have an accuracy that appears to be limited by the
interaction strength.
Finally, we note that, indeed, in the Standard Model itself, the interaction parameters
are remarkably small. This was not known or expected to be the case, a few decades ago.
Relativistically invariant, renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theories have a remarkably
rich mathematical structure. There are vector ﬁelds (for elementary particles with spin
1), spinor ﬁelds (fermions with spin
1/2 ), and scalars (spin 0).
The vector ﬁelds have to be associated with a local gauge theory, usually of the Yang-
Mills type. The number of distinct vector particle species equals the number of dimensions,
also called the rank, of the local gauge group. Electromagnetism has U(1) as its local
gauge group; the dimension is 1, so there is one photon species.
The electro-weak interactions have this local gauge theory enlarged to U(1) ⊗SU(2) ,
with group dimension 4, while the strong force adds to this SU(3) , with dimension 8.
224

The fermionic and the scalar ﬁelds must all come as representations of the gauge
group. They each transform trivially or non-trivially under local gauge transformations.
This determines how these particles couple to the vectorial gauge ﬁelds.
The fermions are based on Dirac’s ﬁeld equation, and the scalars start oﬀwith the
Klein-Gordon equation.
The interactions between these ﬁelds are written as Yukawa
terms for the fermions, and quartic, sometimes also cubic, self interactions for the scalars.
The allowed couplings are severely constrained by the condition that the system has to
be renormalizable and gauge-invariant.
After all algebraic equations have been written down, it must be checked explicitly
whether there are chiral anomalies. These are clashes between current-conservation laws
in the chiral symmetries one might expect in the theory. Anomalies that would be harm-
ful for the self consistency of the theory only occur when right-handed fermions couple
diﬀerently to the gauge ﬁelds than left handed ones. One then has to see to it that these
anomalies cancel out. They indeed do in the Standard Model.
In the Standard Model, the algebra turns out to be arranged in such a way that the
fermions come as three identical copies (“generations”) of quarks and leptons. Quarks
come as triplet representations of the gauge SU(3) group, while the leptons are SU(3)
singlets. All fermions couple, at least to some extent, to the SU(2) ⊗U(1) gauge ﬁelds,
with the exceptions of the right-handed components of the neutrinos, which do not couple
to the gauge ﬁelds at all.
In principle, however, the mathematical rules known today would have allowed just
any compact Lie group as the gauge group, and any kinds of representations for the
fermions and the scalars, as long as there are not too many of those.
This summary here illustrates that the mathematical structure of the generic quantum
ﬁeld theory, and the Standard Model in particular, is fairly complex. It would have to
be reproduced in a deterministic theory of nature. Further details are to be found in
numerous text books. See for instance [29], [36].
20.6.
Vacuum ﬂuctuations, correlations and commutators
Because all contributions to our Hamiltonian are translation invariant, one expects the
correlation functions to be translation invariant as well, and this is a good reason to
consider their Fourier transforms, so, instead of x space, one considers k space:
Pij(x(1) −x(2)) = (2π)−4
Z
d4k ˆPij(k) eik(x(1)−x(2)) ,
(20.21)
where we will often omit the caret (ˆ).
Disregarding factors 2π for the moment, one ﬁnds that the two-point functions are
built from elementary expressions such as the Feynman propagator,
∆F
m(x) ≡−i
Z
d4k
eikx
k2 + m2 −iε ,
x = x(1) −x(2) ,
k2 = ⃗k2 −k2
0 ,
(20.22)
225

where ε is an inﬁnitesimal positive number, indicating how one is allowed to arrange
the complex contour when k0 is allowed to be complex. This propagator describes the
contribution of a single, non interacting particle to the two-point correlation function. If
there are interactions, one ﬁnds that, quite generally, the two-point correlation functions
take the form of a dressed propagator:
∆F(x) =
Z ∞
0
dm ϱ(m) ∆F
m(x) ,
(20.23)
where ϱ(m) is only deﬁned for m ≥0 and it is always non-negative. This property is
dictated by unitarity and positivity of the energy, and always holds exactly in a relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theory [83]. The function ϱ(m) can be regarded as the probability that an
intermediate state emerges whose centre-of-mass energy is given by the number m . In
turn, ϱ(m) can be computed in terms of Feynman diagrams with two external legs; it
describes what may happen to a virtual particle as it travels from x(2) to x(1) . Diagrams
with more external legs (which are usually the contributions to the scattering matrix with
given numbers of free particles asymptotically far away in the in-state and the out-state),
can be computed with these elementary functions as building blocks.
The two-point function physically corresponds to the vacuum expectation value of a
time-ordered product of operators:
Pij(x(1) −x(2)) = ⟨∅|T(Φi(x(1)), Φj(x(2))| ∅⟩,
(20.24)
where
T(A(t1), B(t2))
=
A(t1)B(t2) ,
if t1 > t2 ,
=
B(t2)A(t1) ,
if t2 > t1
(20.25)
(for fermions, this is to be replaced by the P product: a minus sign is added if two
fermions are interchanged).
We shall now show how, in explicit calculations, it is always found that two operators
O1(x(1)) and O2(x(2)) commute when they both are local functions of the ﬁelds Fi(⃗x, t) ,
and when their space-time points are space-like separated:
(⃗x )2 −(x0)2 > 0 ,
x = x(1) −x(2) .
(20.26)
To this end, one introduces the on-shell propagators:
∆±
m(x) = 2π
Z
d4k eikx δ(k2 + m2)θ(±k0) ;
k x = ⃗k · ⃗x −k0x0 .
(20.27)
By contour integration, one easily derives:
∆F
m(x)
=
∆+
m(x)
if x0 > 0 ;
=
∆−
m(x) = ∆+
m(−x)
if x0 < 0 ;
∆F∗
m (x)
=
∆−
m(x)
if x0 > 0 ;
=
∆+
m(x)
if x0 < 0 .
(20.28)
226

Here, ∆F∗
m
is obtained from the Feynman propagator DF
m in Eq. (20.22) by replacing i
with −i .
Now we can use the fact that the expressions for ∆F
m(x) and ∆±
m(x) are Lorentz-
invariant.
Therefore, if x is space-like, one can always go to a Lorentz frame where
x0 > 0 or a Lorentz frame where x0 < 0 , so then,
∆F
m(x) = ∆+
m(x) = ∆−
m(x) = ∆F∗
m (x) = ∆F
m(−x) .
(20.29)
This implies that, in Eq. (20.24), we can always change the order of the two operators
O(x(1)) and O(x(2)) if x(1) and x(2) are space-like separated. Indeed, for all two-point
functions, one can derive from unitarity that they can be described by a dressed propagator
of the form (20.23), where, due to Lorentz invariance, ϱ(m) cannot depend on the sign
of x0 . The only condition needed in this argument is that the operator O1(x(1)) is a
local function of the ﬁelds Φi(x(1)) , and the same for O2(x(2)) . To prove that composite
ﬁelds have two-point functions of the form (20.23), using unitarity and positivity of the
Hamiltonian, we refer to the literature [66]. To see that Eqs. (20.29) indeed imply that
commutators between space-like separated operators vanish, and that this implies the non
existence of information carrying signals between such points, we refer to section 20.7.
Now it is crucial to notice that the Feynman propagator ∆F
m(x) itself does not vanish
at space-like separations. In general, one ﬁnds for free ﬁelds with mass m , at vanishing
x(1)0 −x(2)0 , and writing ⃗r = ⃗x(1) −⃗x(2) ,
⟨∅|T(Φ(x(1)), Φ(x(2)) | ∅⟩= (2π)−4∆F

k2 + m2 eik|⃗r | ,
(20.30)
but, since the ﬁelds here commute, we can omit the T symbol.
When the product
m |⃗r| becomes large, this vanishes rapidly. But when m vanishes, we have long-range
correlations:
⟨∅| Φ(0,⃗r) Φ(0,⃗0 ) | ∅⟩=
1
(2π)2 ⃗r 2 .
(20.31)
For instance, for the photon ﬁeld, the vacuum correlation function for the two-point
function is, in the Feynman gauge,
⟨∅| Aµ(0,⃗r) Aν(0,⃗0 ) | ∅⟩=
gµν
(2π)2 ⃗r 2 .
(20.32)
This means that we do have correlations over space-like distances. We attribute this
to the fact that we always do physics with states that are very close to the vacuum state.
The correlations are non-vanishing in the vacuum, and in all states close to the vacuum
(such as all n -particle states, with n ﬁnite). One may imagine that, at very high or
inﬁnite temperature, all quantum states will contribute with equal probabilities to the
intermediate states, and this may wipe out the correlations, but today’s physics always
227

stays restricted to temperatures that are very low compared to the Planck scale, most of
the time, at most places in the Universe.
There is even more one can say. Due to the special analytic structure of the propagators
∆F
m(x) , the n point functions can be analytically continued from Minkowski space-time
to Euclidean space-time and back. This means that, if the Euclidean correlation functions
are known, also the scattering matrix elements in Minkowski space-time follow, so that the
entire evolution process at a given initial state can be derived if the space like correlation
functions are known. Therefore, if someone thinks there is “conspiracy” in the space-like
correlations that leads to peculiar phenomena later or earlier in time, then this might
be explained in terms of the fundamental mathematical structure of a quantum ﬁeld
theory. The author suspects that this explains why “conspiracy” in “unlikely” space-like
correlations seems to invalidate the Bell and CHSH inequalities, while in fact this may be
seen as a natural phenomenon. In any case, it should be obvious from the observations
above, that the correlations in quantised ﬁeld theories do not require any conspiracy, but
are totally natural.
20.7.
Commutators and signals
We shall now show that, just because all space-like separated sets of operators commute,
no signal can be exchanged that goes faster than light, no matter how entangled the
particles are that one looks at. This holds for all relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories, and
in particular for the Standard Model. This fact is sometimes overlooked in studies of
peculiar quantum phenomena.
Of course, if we replace the space-time continuum by a lattice in space, while time stays
continuous, we lose Lorentz invariance, so that signals can go much faster, in principle
(they still cannot go backwards in time).
Consider a ﬁeld φ(x) , where x is a point in space-time. Let the ﬁeld be self-adjoint:
φ(x) = φ†(x) .
(20.33)
In conventional quantum ﬁeld theories, ﬁelds are operators in the sense that they measure
things and at the same time modify the state, all at one space-time point x . Usually, the
ﬁeld averages in vacuum are zero:
⟨∅|φ(x)|∅⟩= 0 .
(20.34)
Can a signal arrive at a point x(1) when transmitted from a point x(2) ? To ﬁnd out, take
the ﬁeld operators φ(x(1)) and φ(x(2)) . Let us take the case t(1) ≥t(2) . In this case,
consider the propagator
⟨∅|T(φ(x(1)), φ(x(2)))|∅⟩= ⟨∅|φ(x(1)) φ(x(2))|∅⟩=
= ∆F
m(x(1) −x(2)) = ∆+
m(x(1) −x(2)) .
(20.35)
It tells us what the correlations are between the ﬁeld values at x(1) and at x(2) . This
quantity does not vanish, as is typical for correlation functions, even when points are
space-like separated.
228

The question is now whether the operation of the ﬁeld at x(2) can aﬀect the state
at x(1) . This would be the case if the result of the product of the actions of the ﬁelds
depends on their order, and so we ask: to what extent does the expression (20.35) diﬀer
from
⟨∅|φ(x(2)) φ(x(1))|∅⟩= (⟨∅|φ†(x(1)) φ†(x(2))|∅⟩)∗= (⟨∅|T(φ(x(1)), φ(x(2)))|∅⟩)∗=
= ∆F ∗
m (x(1) −x(2)) = ∆−
m(x(1) −x(2)) .
(20.36)
In stead of ∆m(x) we could have considered the dressed propagators of the interacting
ﬁelds, which, from general principles, can be shown to take the form of Eq. (20.23). We
always end up with the identity (20.29), which means that the commutator vanishes:
⟨∅| [φ(x(1)), φ(x(2))] |∅⟩= 0 ,
(20.37)
if x(1) and x(2) are space-like separated. Thus, it makes no diﬀerence whether we act
with φ(x(1)) before or after we let φ(x(2)) act on the vacuum. This means that no signal
can be sent from x(2) to x(1) if it would have to go faster than light.
Since Eqs. (20.29) can be proved to hold exactly in all orders of the perturbation
expansion in quantum ﬁeld theory, just by using the general properties (20.28) of the
propagators in the theory, one concludes that conventional quantum ﬁeld theories never
allow signals to be passed on faster than light. This is very important since less rigorous
reasoning starting from the possible production of entangled particles, sometimes make
investigators believe that there are ‘spooky signals’ going faster than light in quantum
systems. Whatever propagates faster than light, however, can never carry information.
This holds for quantum ﬁeld theories and it holds for cellular automata.
20.8.
The renormalization group
A feature of quantum ﬁeld theories that plays a special role in our considerations is the
renormalization group. This group consists of symmetry transformations that in their
earliest form were assumed to be associated to the procedure of adding renormaliza-
tion counter terms to masses and interaction coeﬃcients of the theory. These counter
terms are necessary to assure that higher order corrections do not become inﬁnitely large
when systematic (perturbative) calculations are performed. The ambiguity in separating
interaction parameters from the counter terms can be regarded as a symmetry of the
theory. [11]
In practice, this kind of symmetry becomes important when one applies scale transfor-
mations in a theory: at large distances, the counter terms should be chosen diﬀerently from
what they are at a small distance scale, if in both cases we require that higher order cor-
rections are kept small. In practice, this has an important consequence for most quantum
ﬁeld theories: a scale transformation must be accompanied by small, calculable corrections
to all mass terms and interaction coeﬃcients. This then adds ‘anomalous dimensions’ to
the mass and coupling parameters [23][24][83]. In lowest order, these anomalies are easy
to calculate, and the outcome is typically:
d
dµλ(µ) = βλ λ(µ)2 ,
d
dµm(µ) = βm λ(µ) m(µ) ,
(20.38)
229

with dimensionless coeﬃcients βλ and βm . Here, µ represents the mass scale at which
the coupling and mass parameters are being considered.
In gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics, it is the charge squared, e(µ)2 , or
equivalently, the ﬁne structure constant α(µ) , that plays the role of the running coupling
parameter λ(µ) .
A special feature for non-Abelian gauge theories is that, there, the
coeﬃcient βg2 receives a large negative contribution from the gauge self couplings, so,
unless there are many charged ﬁelds present, this renormalization group coeﬃcient is
negative.
It is important to observe, that the consideration of the renormalization group would
have been quite insigniﬁcant had there not been large scale diﬀerences that are relevant for
the theory. These diﬀerences originate from the fact that we have very large and very tiny
masses in the system. In the eﬀective Hamiltonians that we might be able to obtain from
a cellular automaton, it is not quite clear how such large scale diﬀerences could arise.
Presumably, we have to work with diﬀerent symmetry features, each symmetry being
broken at a diﬀerent scale. Here we just note that this is not self-evident. The problem
that we encounter here is the hierarchy problem, the fact that enormously diﬀerent length-,
mass- and time scales govern our world, see section 8.2. This is not only a problem for
our theory here, it is a problem that will have to be confronted by any theory addressing
physics at the Planck scale.
The mass and coupling parameters of a theory are not the only quantities that are
transformed in a non-trivial way under a scale transformation. All local operators O(⃗x, t)
will receive ﬁnite renormalizations when scale transformations are performed. When com-
posite operators are formed by locally multiplying diﬀerent kinds of ﬁelds, the operator
product expansion requires scale dependent counter terms. What this means is that op-
erator expressions obtained by multiplying ﬁelds together undergo thorough changes and
mixtures upon large scale transformations. The transformation that leads us from the
Planck scale to the Standard Model scale is probably such a large scale transformation57,
so that not only the masses and couplings that we observe today, but also the ﬁelds and
operator combinations that we use in the Standard Model today, will be quite diﬀerent
from what they may look like at the Planck scale.
Note that, when a renormalization group transformation is performed, couplings, ﬁelds
and operators re-arrange themselves according to their canonical dimensions. When going
from high mass scales to low mass scales, coeﬃcients with highest mass dimensions, and
operators with lowest mass dimensions, become most signiﬁcant. This implies that, seen
from a large distance scale, the most complicated theories simplify since, complicated,
composite ﬁelds, as well as the coeﬃcients they are associated with, will rapidly become
insigniﬁcant. This is generally assumed to be the technical reason why all our ‘eﬀective’
theories at the present mass scale are renormalizable ﬁeld theories. Non-renormalizable
coeﬃcients have become insigniﬁcant. Even if our local Hamiltonian density may be quite
ugly at the Planck scale, it will come out as a clean, renormalizable theory at scales such
as the Standard Model scale, exactly as the Standard Model itself, which was arrived at
57Unless several extra space-time dimensions show up just beyond the TeV domain, which would bring
the Planck scale closer to the Standard Model scale.
230

by ﬁtting the phenomena observed today.
The features of the renormalization group brieﬂy discussed here, are strongly linked to
Lorentz invariance. Without this invariance group, scaling would be a lot more complex,
as we can see in condensed matter physics. This is the reason why we do not plan to give
up Lorentz invariance without a ﬁght.
21.
The cellular automaton
The fundamental notion of a cellular automaton was brieﬂy introduced in Part I, sec-
tion 5.1. We here resume the discussion of constructing a quantum Hamiltonian for these
classical systems, with the intention to arrive at some expression that may be compared
with the Hamiltonian of a quantum ﬁeld theory [88], resembling Eq. (20.6), with Hamil-
tonian density (20.7), and/or (20.14). In this chapter, we show that one can come very
close, although, not surprisingly, we do hit upon diﬃculties that have not been completely
resolved.
21.1.
Local time reversibility by switching from even to odd sites and
back
Time reversibility is important for allowing us to perform simple mathematical manipu-
lations. Without time reversibility, one would not be allowed to identify single states of
an automaton with basis elements of a Hilbert space. Now this does not invalidate our
ideas if time reversibility is not manifest; in that case one has to identify basis states in
Hilbert space with information equivalence classes, as was explained in section 7. The
author does suspect that this more complicated situation might well be inevitable in our
ultimate theories of the world, but we have to investigate the simpler models ﬁrst. They
are time reversible. Fortunately, there are rich classes of time reversible models that allow
us to sharpen our analytical tools, before making our lives more complicated.
Useful models are obtained from systems where the evolution law U consists of two
parts: UA prescribes how to update all even lattice sites, and UB gives the updates of
the odd lattice sites. So we have U = UA · UB .
21.1.1.
The time reversible cellular automaton
In section 5.1, a very simple rule was introduced. The way it was phrased there, the data
on two consecutive time layers were required to deﬁne the time evolution in the future
direction as well as back towards the past – these automata are time reversible. Since,
quite generally, most of our models work with single time layers that evolve towards the
future or the past, we shrink the time variable by a factor 2. Then, one complete time
step for this automaton consists of two procedures: one that updates all even sites only,
in a simple, reversible manner, leaving the odd sites unchanged, while the procedure does
depend on the data on the odd sites, and one that updates only the odd sites, while
231

depending on the data at the even sites. The ﬁrst of these operators is called UA . It is
the operator product of all operations UA(⃗x) , where ⃗x are all even sites, and we take all
these operations to commute:
UA =
Y
⃗x even
UA(⃗x) ;
[UA(⃗x), UA(⃗x ′)] = 0 ,
∀⃗x, ⃗x ′ .
(21.1)
The commutation is assured if UA(⃗x) depends only on its neighbours, which are odd,
but not on the next-to-nearest neighbours, which are even again. Similarly, we have the
operation at the odd sites:
UB =
Y
⃗y odd
UB(⃗y) ;
[UB(⃗y), UB(⃗y ′)] = 0 ,
∀⃗y, ⃗y ′ ,
(21.2)
while [UA(⃗x), UB(⃗y)] ̸= 0 only if ⃗x and ⃗y are direct neighbours.
In general, UA(⃗x) and UB(⃗y) at any single site are suﬃciently simple (often they are
ﬁnite-dimensional, orthogonal matrices) that they are easy to write as exponentials:
UA(⃗x)
=
e−iA(⃗x) ,
[A(⃗x), A(⃗x ′)] = 0 ;
UB(⃗y)
=
e−iB(⃗y) ,
[B(⃗y), B(⃗y ′)] = 0 .
(21.3)
A(⃗x) and B(⃗y) are deﬁned to lie in the domain [0, 2π) , or sometimes in the domain
(−π, π] .
The advantage of this notation is that we can now write58
UA = e−iA ,
A =
X
⃗x even
A(⃗x) ;
UB = e−iB ,
B =
X
⃗y odd
B(⃗y) ,
(21.4)
and the complete evolution operator for one time step δt = 1 can be written as
U(δt) = e−iH = e−iA e−iB .
(21.5)
Let the data in a cell ⃗x be called Q(⃗x) . In the case that the operation UA(⃗x) consists
of a simple addition (either a plane addition or an addition modulo some integer N ) by
a quantity δQ(Q(⃗yi)) , where ⃗yi are the direct neighbours of ⃗x , then it is easy to write
down explicitly the operators A(⃗x) and B(⃗y) . Just introduce the translation operator
Uη(⃗x) = eiη(⃗x) ,
Uη| Q(⃗x) ⟩≡| Q(⃗x) −1 modulo N ⟩,
(21.6)
to ﬁnd
UA(⃗x) = e−iη(⃗x) δQ(Q(⃗yi)) ,
A(⃗x) = η(⃗x) δQ(Q(⃗yi)) ;
B(⃗y) = η(⃗y) δQ(Q(⃗xi)) .
(21.7)
58The sign in the exponents is chosen such that the operators A and B act as Hamiltonians themselves.
232

The operator η(⃗x) is not hard to analyse. Assume that we are in a ﬁeld of additions
modulo N , as in Eq. (21.6). Go the basis of states |k⟩U , with k = 0, 1, · · · , N −1 , where
the subscript U indicates that they are eigenstates of Uη and η (at the point ⃗x ):
⟨Q|k⟩U ≡
1
√
N e2πikQ/N .
(21.8)
We have
⟨Q|Uη|k⟩U = ⟨Q + 1|k⟩U = e2πik/N⟨Q|k⟩U ;
Uη|k⟩= e2πik/N|k⟩U
(21.9)
(if −1
2N < k ≤1
2N ), so we can deﬁne η by
η|k⟩U = 2π
N k|k⟩U ,
⟨Q1|η|Q2⟩=

k sin(2πk(Q1 −Q2)/N) ,
(21.10)
mathematical manipulations that must look familiar now, see Eqs. (2.25) and (2.26) in
section 2.2.1.
Now δQ(⃗yi) does not commute with η(⃗yi) , and in Eq. (21.7) our model assumes the
sites ⃗yi to be only direct neighbours of ⃗x and ⃗xi are only the direct neighbours of ⃗y .
Therefore, all A(⃗x) also commute with B(⃗y) unless |⃗x −⃗y | = 1 . This simpliﬁes our
discussion of the Hamiltonian H in Eq. (21.5).
21.1.2.
The discrete classical Hamiltonian model
In subsection 19.4.4, we have seen how to generate a local discrete evolution law from a
classical, discrete Hamiltonian formalism. Starting from a discrete, non negative Hamil-
tonian function H , typically taking values N = 0, 1, 2, · · · ,one searches for an evolution
law that keeps this number invariant. This classical H may well be deﬁned as a sum of
local terms, so that we have a non negative discrete Hamiltonian density. It was decided
that a local evolution law U(⃗x) with the desired properties can be deﬁned, after which
one only has to decide in which order this local operation has to be applied to deﬁne
a unique theory. In order to avoid spurious non-local behaviour, the following rule was
proposed:
The evolution equations (e.o.m.) of the entire system over one time step δt ,
are obtained by ordering the coordinates as follows: ﬁrst update all even
lattice sites, then update all odd lattice sites
(how exactly to choose the order within a given site is immaterial for our discussion).
The advantage of this rule is that the U(⃗x) over all even sites ⃗x can be chosen all to
commute, and the operators on all odd sites ⃗y will also all commute with one another;
233

the only non-commutativity then occurs between an evolution operator U(⃗x) at an even
site, and the operator U(⃗y) at an adjacent site ⃗y .
Thus, this model ends up with exactly the same fundamental properties as the time
reversible automaton introduced in subsection 21.1.1: we have UA as deﬁned in Eq. (21.1)
and UB as in (21.2), followed by Eqs. (21.3)–(21.5).
We conclude that, for model building, splitting a space-time lattice into the even and
the odd sub lattices is a trick with wide applications. It does not mean that we should
believe that the real world is also organised in a lattice system, where such a fundamental
role is to be attributed to the even and odd sub lattices; it is merely a convenient tool for
model building. We shall now discuss why this splitting does seem to lead us very close
to a quantum ﬁeld theory.
21.2.
The Baker Campbell Hausdorﬀexpansion
The two models of the previous two subsections, the arbitrary cellular automaton and
the discrete Hamiltonian model, are very closely related. They are both described by an
evolution operator that consists of two steps, UA and UB , or, Ueven and Uodd . The same
general principles apply. We deﬁne A, A(⃗x), B and B(⃗x) as in Eq. (21.4).
To compute the Hamiltonian H , we may consider using the Baker Campbell Hausdorﬀ
expansion [34]:
eP eQ = eR ,
R = P + Q + 1
2[P, Q] + 1
12[P, [P, Q]] + 1
12[[P, Q], Q] + 1
24[[P, [P, Q]], Q] + · · · ,
(21.11)
a series that continues exclusively with commutators. Replacing P by −iA , Q by −iB
and R by −iH , we ﬁnd a series for H in the form of an inﬁnite sequence of commutators.
Now we noted at the end of the previous subsection that the commutators between the
local operators
A(⃗x) and B(⃗x ′) are non-vanishing only if ⃗x and ⃗x ′ are neighbours,
|⃗x −⃗x ′| = 1 . Therefore, if we insert the sums (21.4) into Eq. (21.11), we obtain again a
sum. Writing
K(⃗r)
=
A(⃗r) if ⃗r is even, and B(⃗r) if ⃗r is odd,
L(⃗r)
=
A(⃗r) if ⃗r is even, and −B(⃗r) if ⃗r is odd,
(21.12)
so that
A(⃗r) = 1
2

K(⃗r) + L(⃗r)

and B(⃗r) = 1
2

K(⃗r) −L(⃗r)

,
(21.13)
we ﬁnd
H =
X
⃗r
H(⃗r) ,
H(⃗r) = H1(⃗r) + H2(⃗r) + H3(⃗r) + · · · ,
(21.14)
234

where
H1(⃗r)
=
K(⃗r) ,
H2(⃗r)
=

⃗s
[K(⃗r), L(⃗s)] ,
H3(⃗r)
=

24
X
⃗s1,⃗s2
[L(⃗r) , [K(⃗s1), L(⃗s2)]] ,
etc.
(21.15)
The sums here are only over close neighbours, so that each term here can be regarded as
a local Hamiltonian density term.
Note however, that as we proceed to collect higher terms of the expansion, more and
more distant sites will eventually contribute; Hn(⃗r) will receive contributions from sites
at distance n −1 from the original point ⃗r .
Note furthermore that the expansion (21.14) is inﬁnite, and convergence is not guar-
anteed; in fact, one may suspect it not to be valid at all, as soon as energies larger than
the inverse of the time unit δt come into play. We will have to discuss that problem. But
ﬁrst an important observation that improves the expansion.
21.3.
Conjugacy classes
One might wonder what happens if we change the order of the even and the odd sites.
We would get
U(δt) = e−iH ?= e−iB e−iA ,
(21.16)
in stead of Eq. (21.5). Of course this expression could have been used just as well. In
fact, it results from a very simple basis transformation: we went from the states |ψ⟩to
the states UB|ψ⟩. As we stated repeatedly, we note that such basis transformations do
not aﬀect the physics.
This implies that we do not need to know exactly the operator U(δt) as deﬁned in
Eqs. (21.5) or (21.16), we just need any one element of its conjugacy class. The conjugacy
class is deﬁned by the set of operators of the form
G U(δt) G−1 ,
(21.17)
where G can be any unitary operator. Writing G = eF , where F is anti-hermitean, we
replace Eq. (21.11) by
e
˜R = eF eP eQ e−F ,
(21.18)
so that
˜R = R + [F, R] + 1
2[F, [F, R]] + 1
3![F, [F, [F, R]]] + · · · .
(21.19)
We can now decide to choose F in such a way that the resulting expression becomes
as simple as possible. For one, interchanging P and Q should not matter. Secondly,
235

replacing P and Q by −P and −Q should give −˜R , because then we are looking at
the inverse of Eq. (21.19).
The calculations simplify if we write
S = 1
2(P + Q) ,
D = 1
2(P −Q) ;
P = S + D ,
Q = S −D
(21.20)
(or, in the previous section, S = −1
2iK , D = −1
2iL ). With
e
˜R = eF eS+D eS−D e−F ,
(21.21)
we can now demand F to be such that:
˜R(S, D) = ˜R(S, −D) = −˜R(−S, −D) ,
(21.22)
which means that ˜R contains only even powers of D and odd powers of S . We can fur-
thermore demand that ˜R only contains terms that are commutators of D with something;
contributions that are commutators of S with something can be removed iteratively by
judicious choices of F .
Using these constraints, one ﬁnds a function F(S, D) and
˜R(S, D) .
First let us
introduce a short hand notation. All our expressions will consist of repeated commutators.
Therefore we introduce the notation
{X1, X2, · · · , Xn} ≡[X1, [X2, [ · · · , Xn ]] · · ·] .
(21.23)
Subsequently, we even drop the accolades { } . So when we write
X1 X2 X2
3 X4 ,
we actually mean: [X1, [X2, [X3, [X3, X4]]]] .
Then, with F = −1
2D + 1
24S2D + · · · , one ﬁnds
˜R(S, D) = 2S −1
12DSD +
1
960D(8S2 −D2)SD +
1
60480D(−51 S4 −76 DSDS + 33 D2S2 + 44 SD2S −3
8D4)SD + O(S, D)9 .
(21.24)
There are three remarks to be added to this result:
(1) It is much more compact than the original BCH expansion; already the ﬁrst two
terms of the expansion (21.24) correspond to all terms shown in Eq. (21.11).
(2) The coeﬃcients appear to be much smaller than the ones in (21.11), considering
the factors
1/2 in Eqs. (21.20) that have to be included. We found that, in general,
sizeable cancellations occur between the coeﬃcients in (21.11).
(3) However, there is no reason to suspect that the series will actually converge any
better.
The deﬁnitions of F and
˜R may be expected to generate singularities
when P and Q , or S and D reach values where e ˜R obtains eigenvalues that
return to one, so, for ﬁnite matrices, the radius of convergence is expected to be of
the order 2π .
236

In this representation, all terms Hn(⃗r) in Eq. (21.14) with n even, vanish. Using
S = −1
2iK ,
D = −1
2iL ,
˜R = −i ˜H ,
(21.25)
one now arrives at the Hamiltonian in the new basis:
˜H1(⃗r) = K(⃗r) ,
˜H3(⃗r) =
1
96
P
⃗s1,⃗s2[L(⃗r), [K(⃗s1), L(⃗s2)]] ,
(21.26)
˜H5(⃗r) =
1
30720
P
⃗s1,···,⃗s4[L(⃗r),

8[K(⃗s1), [K(⃗s2) −[L(⃗s1), [L(⃗s2)

, [K(⃗s3), L(⃗s4)]]]] ,
and ˜H7 follows from the last line of Eq. (21.24).
All these commutators are only non-vanishing if the coordinates ⃗s1 , ⃗s2 , etc., are
all neighbours of the coordinate ⃗r . It is true that, in the higher order terms, next-to-
nearest neighbours may enter, but still, one may observe that these operators all are local
functions of the ‘ﬁelds’ Q(⃗x, t) , and thus we arrive at a Hamiltonian H that can be
regarded as the sum over d -dimensional space of a Hamiltonian density H(⃗x) , which has
the property that
[H(⃗x), H(⃗x ′)] = 0 ,
if
|⃗x, ⃗x ′| ≫1 .
(21.27)
At every ﬁnite order of the series, the Hamiltonian density H(⃗x) is a ﬁnite-dimensional
hermitean matrix, and therefore, it will have a lowest eigenvalue h . In a large but ﬁnite
volume V , the total Hamiltonian H will therefore also have a lowest eigenvalue, obeying
E0 > h V .
(21.28)
However, it was tacitly assumed that the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula con-
verges. This is usually not the case. One can argue that the series may perhaps converge
if sandwiched between two eigenstates |E1⟩and |E2⟩of H , where E1 and E2 are the
eigenvalues, that obey
|E1 −E2| ≪2π ,
(21.29)
We cannot exclude that the resulting eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theory will depend quite
non-trivially on the number of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀterms that are kept in the
expansion.
The Hamiltonian density (21.26) may appear to be quite complex and unsuitable to
serve as a quantum ﬁeld theory model, but it is here that we actually expect that the
renormalization group will thoroughly cleanse our Hamiltonian, by invoking the mecha-
nism described at the end of subsection 20.8.
22.
The problem of quantum locality
When we have a classical cellular automaton, the condition of locality is easy to formulate
and to impose. All one needs to require is that the contents of the cells are being updated
237

at the beat of a clock: once every unit of time, δt . If we assume the updates to take
place in such a way that every cell is only aﬀected by the contents of its direct neighbours,
then it will be clear that signals can only be passed on with a limited velocity, c , usually
obeying
|c| ≤|δx/δt| ,
(22.1)
where |δx| is the distance between neighbouring cells. One could argue that this is a
desirable property, which at some point might be tied in with special relativity, a theory
that also demands that no signals go faster than a limiting speed c .
The notion of locality in quantum physics is a bit more subtle, but in quantum ﬁeld
theories one can also demand that no signals go faster than a limiting speed c . If a signal
from a space-time point x(1) can reach an other space-time point x(2) , we say that x(2)
lies in the forward light cone of x(1) . If x(2) can send a signal to x(1) , then x(2) is in the
backward light cone of x(1) ; if neither x(1) can aﬀect x(2) nor x(2) can aﬀect x(1) , we
say that x(1) and x(2) are space-like separated.
The way to implement this in quantum ﬁeld theories is by constructing a Hamiltonian
in such a way that, for space-like separated space-time points, all quantum operators
deﬁned at x(1) commute with all operators deﬁned at x(2) . The quantum ﬁeld theories
used to describe the Standard Model obey this constraint. Physically, one can easily see
that, under this condition, performing any operation at x(1) and any measurement at
x(2) , give the same result regardless the order of these two operations.
However, the existence of light cones, due to a ﬁxed light velocity c , would not have
been easy to deduce from the Hamiltonian unless the theory happens to obey the restric-
tions of special relativity. If the model is self-consistent in diﬀerent inertial frames, and
space-like operators commute at equal times, then relativity theory tells us they must
commute everywhere outside the light cone. Now, most of our cellular automaton models
fail to obey special relativity – not because we might doubt on the validity of the theory
of special relativity, but because relativistically invariant cellular automaton models are
extremely diﬃcult to construct. Consequently, our eﬀective Hamiltonians for these mod-
els tend to be non-commutative also outside the light cone, in spite of the fact that the
automaton cannot send signals faster than light.
This is one of the reasons why our eﬀective Hamiltonians do not even approximately
resemble the Standard Model. This does seem to be a mere technical problem, but it is
a very important one, and the question we now wish to pose is whether any systematic
approach can be found to cure this apparent disease.
This important question may well be one of the principal reasons why as of the present
only very few physicists are inclined to take the Cellular Automaton Interpretation se-
riously. It is as if there is a fundamental obstacle standing in the way of reconstructing
existing physical models of the world using cellular automata.
Note, that the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀexpansion does seem to imply a weaker
form of quantum locality: if we terminate the expansion at any ﬁnite order N , then
the eﬀective Hamiltonian density H(⃗x(1)) commutes with H(⃗x(2)) at equal times, if
|⃗x(1) −⃗x(2)| ≥N |δ⃗x| . As we stated earlier, however, this is not good enough, because
238

the BCH expansion is not expected to converge at all.
We have to search for better
constructions.
22.1.
Second quantisation in Cellular Automata
A promising approach for dealing with the danger of non-locality and unboundedness of
the Hamiltonian may also be to stick more closely to quantum ﬁeld theories. As it turns
out, this requires that we ﬁrst set up automata that describe freely moving particles;
subsequently, one follows the procedure of second quantisation, described in section 15,
and further elaborated in subsection 15.2.3, and section 20.3.
In our theory, this means that we ﬁrst have to describe deterministic motion of a single
particle. We have already examples: the massless “neutrino” of section 15.2, and the
superstring, section 17.3, but if we wish to reproduce anything resembling the Standard
Model, we need the complete set, as described in section 20.5: fermions, scalar bosons,
gauge bosons, and perhaps gravitons. This will be diﬃcult, because the ﬁelds we have
today are mirroring the wave functions of standard quantum particles, which propagate
non-deterministically.
We now have to replace these by the wave functions of deterministic objects, in line
with what has been discussed before, and rely on the expectation that, if we do this right,
renormalization group eﬀects may turn these into the more familiar quantised ﬁelds we
see in the Standard Model. The advantage of this approach should be that now we can
start with ﬁrst-quantised states where the energy needs not be bounded below; second
quantisation will take care of that: we get particles and antiparticles, see section 20.3.
A conceivable approach towards deterministic ﬁrst-quantised particles is to start with
discrete PQ variables: discrete positions of a particle are labelled by three dimensional
vectors ⃗Q , and their momenta by discrete variables ⃗P . The conjugated variables are
fractional momenta ⃗κ and fractional positions ⃗ξ , and we start with
e−iκi|⃗Q, ⃗P⟩= |⃗Q + ei, ⃗P⟩,
eiξi|⃗Q, ⃗P⟩= |⃗Q, ⃗P + ei⟩,
(22.2)
where ei are unit vectors spanning over one lattice unit in the i th direction. Subsequently,
we add phases ϕ(⃗κ, ⃗ξ) as in chapter 16. We then choose deterministic evolution equations
for our ‘primordial’ particle in terms of its (⃗P, ⃗Q) coordinates. Our ﬁrst attempt will
be to describe a fermion. It should resemble the “neutrino” from chapter 15.2, but we
may have to replace the sheets by point particles. This means that the primordial particle
cannot obey Dirac’s equation. The important point is that we give the primordial particle
a Hamiltonian hop
0
having a spectrum ranging from −π/δt to π/δt in natural units, using
the systematic procedure described in chapter 14. hop
0
does not yet describe interactions.
It is a free Hamiltonian and therefore it allows for a detailed calculation of the particle’s
properties, which of course will be trivial, in a sense, until we add interactions.
Upon second quantisation then, if the negative energy levels are ﬁlled, and he positive
energy levels are kept empty, we have the vacuum state, the state with lowest energy.
This gives us a local Hamilton density Hop
0 , and the evolution operator over one unit
239

δt in time will be generated by the operator (see section 15; we set δt = 1 again)
U op
A = e−iHop
0 ,
Hop = ψ hop
0 ψ ,
(22.3)
This operator obeys locality and positivity by construction: locality follows from the
observation described in chapter 14, which is that the expansion of arc sines converge
rapidly when we limit ourselves to the middle of the energy spectrum, and positivity
follows from second quantisation.
Now we carefully insert interactions. These will be described by an evolution operator
U op
B = e−iBop . Of course, this operator must also be deterministic. Our strategy is now
that U op
B
will only generate rare, local interactions; for instance, we can postulate that
two particles aﬀect each other’s motion only under fairly special circumstances of the
surrounding vacuum. Note, that the vacuum is ﬁlled with particles, and these degrees
of freedom may all play a role. We ensure that the interaction described by U op
B
is still
local, although perhaps next-to-next-to nearest neighbours could interact.
The total evolution operator is then
e−iHop = U op(δt) = (U op
A )
1
2 U op
B (U op
A )
1
2 = e−1
2 iHop
0 e−iBop e−1
2 iHop
0 ,
(22.4)
which we symmetrised with the powers
1/2 for later convenience. This, we subject to the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀexpansion, section 21.2.
Now, it is important to make use of the fact that Bop is small. Expanding with respect
to Bop , we may start with just the ﬁrst non-trivial term. Using the notation deﬁned in
Eq. (21.23) of section 21.3, we can ﬁnd the complete set of terms in the expansion of Hop
to all powers of Hop
0
but up to terms linear in Bop only. This goes as follows: let A, B,
and C(t) be operators, and t an arbitrary, small parameter. We use the fact that
eF R e−F = {eF, R} = R + [F, R] + 1
2![F, [F, R]] + 1
3![F, [F, [F, R]]] + · · · ,
(22.5)
and an expression for diﬀerentiating the exponent of an operator C(t) , to derive:
eC(t)

C(t) , dC

2 A, B} ,
(22.6)
where, in the last line, we multiplied with e−C(t) at the right. Expanding in t , writing
C(t) = A + tC1 + O(t2) , we ﬁnd
dC(t)
dt
= {
C(t)
eC(t)−1 e
1
2 A , B} ;
C(t) = A + {
A
2 sinh( 1
2 A), tB} + O(t2B2) .
(22.7)
From this we deduce that the operator Hop in Eq. (22.4) expands as
Hop = Hop
0 + {
Hop
0
2 sin( 1
2 Hop
0 ), Bop} + O(Bop)2 .
(22.8)

Expanding the inverse sine, the accolades give

5760[Hop

+ O(Bop)2 .
(22.9)
We can now make several remarks:
– This is again a BCH expansion, and again, one can object that it does not converge,
neither in powers of Hop
0
nor in powers of Bop .
– However, now Bop may be assumed to be small, so we do not have to go to high
powers of Bop , when we wish to compute its eﬀect on the Hamiltonian.
– But the expansion in Hop
0
at ﬁrst sight looks worrying. However:
– We have the entire expression (22.8), (22.9) to our disposal. The term linear in Bop
can be rewritten as follows:
Let Bkℓbe the matrix elements of the operator Bop in the basis of eigenstates
|E0⟩of Hop
0 . Then, the expression in accolades can be seen to generate the matrix
elements of Hop :
Hkℓ=
∆Eo
kℓ
2 sin( 1
2 ∆Eo
kℓ) Bkℓ,
(22.10)
where ∆Eo
kℓis the energy diﬀerence between the two basis elements considered.
– Since Bop is considered to be small, the energies E0 of the states considered are
expected to stay very close to the total energies of these states.
– It is perhaps not unreasonable now to assume that we may limit ourselves to ‘soft
templates’, where only low values for the total energies are involved. This may mean
that we might never have to worry about energies as large as 2π/δt , where we see
the ﬁrst singularity in the expansion (22.9).
Thus, in this approach, we see good hopes that only the ﬁrst few terms of the BCH
expansion suﬃce to get a good picture of our interacting Hamiltonian. These terms all
obey locality, and the energy will still be bounded from below.
There will still be a long way to go before we can make contact with the Standard
Model describing the world as we know it. What our procedure may have given us is a
decent, local as well as bounded Hamiltonian at the Planck scale. We know from quantum
ﬁeld theories that to relate such a Hamiltonian to physics that can be experimentally
investigated, we have to make a renormalization group transformation covering some
20 orders of magnitude. It is expected that this transformation may wipe out most of
the eﬀective non-renormalizable interactions in our primordial Hamiltonian, but all these
things still have to be proven.
241

An interesting twist to the second-quantisation approach advocated here is that we
have a small parameter for setting up a perturbation expansion. The sequence of higher
order corrections starts out to converge very well, but then, at very high orders, divergence
will set in. What this means is that, in practice, our quantum Hamiltonian is deﬁned with
a built-in margin of error that is extremely tiny but non-vanishing, just as what we have
in quantum ﬁeld theory. This might lead to a formal non-locality that is far too small to
be noticed in our quantum calculations, while it could suﬃce to take away some of the
apparent paradoxes that are still bothering many of us.
What we did in this section is that we produced a credible scenario of how a theory
not unlike the Standard Model may emerge from further studies of the approach proposed
here. It was an argument, not yet a proof, in favour of the existence of cellular automaton
models with this capacity.
22.2.
More about edge states
Edge states were encountered frequently in this investigation. They arise when we attempt
to reproduce canonical commutation rules auch as
[q, p] = iI ,
(22.11)
in a ﬁnite dimensional vector space. To prove that this is fundamentally impossible is
easy: just note that
Tr(p q) = Tr(q p) ,
Tr(I) = N ,
(22.12)
where N is the dimensionality of the vector space. So, we see that in a ﬁnite-dimensional
vector space, we need at least one state that violates Eq. (22.11). This is then our edge
state. When we limit ourselves to states orthogonal to that, we recover Eq. (22.11), but
one cannot avoid that necessarily the operators q and p will connect the other states to
the edge state eventually.
In the continuum, this is also true; the operators q and p map some states with ﬁnite
L2 norm onto states with inﬁnite norm.
Often, our edge states are completely delocalised in space-time, or in the space of ﬁeld
variables. To require that we limit ourselves to quantum states that are orthogonal to
edge states means that we are making certain restrictions on our boundary conditions.
What happens at the boundary of the universe? What happens at the boundary of the
Hamiltonian (that is, at inﬁnite energies)? This seems to be hardly of relevance when
questions are asked about the local laws of our physical world. In chapter 16, we identiﬁed
one edge state to a single point on a two-dimensional torus. There, we were motivated
by the desire to obtain more convergent expressions. Edge states generate eﬀective non-
locality, which we would like to see reduced to a minimum.
We also had to confront edge states in our treatment of the constraints for the lon-
gitudinal modes of string theory (subsection 17.3.5). Intuitively, these edge state eﬀects
seem to be more dangerous there.
242

Note furthermore, that in our ﬁrst attempts to identify the vacuum state, section 14,
it is found that the vacuum state may turn out to be an edge state. This is deﬁnitely
a situation we need to avoid, for which we now propose to use the procedure of second
quantisation. Edge states are not always as innocent as they look.
22.3.
Invisible hidden variables
In the simplest examples of models that we discussed, for instance those in chapters 13 and
15, the relation between the deterministic states and the quantum basis states is mostly
straightforward and unambiguous. However, when we reach more advanced constructions,
we ﬁnd that, given the quantum Hamiltonian and the description of the Hilbert space in
which it acts, there is a multitude of ways in which one can deﬁne the ontological states.
This happens when the quantum model possesses symmetries that are broken in the on-
tological description. Look at our treatment of string theory in section 17.3: the quantum
theory has the entire continuous, D dimensional Poincar´e group as a symmetry, whereas,
in the deterministic description, this is broken down to the discrete lattice translations
and rotations in the D −2 dimensional transverse space.
Since most of our deterministic models necessarily consist of discretised variables, they
will only, at best, have discrete symmetries, which means the all continuous symmetries
C of the quantum world that we attempt to account for, must be broken down to discrete
subgroups D ⊂C . This means that there is a group C/D of non-trivial transformations
of the set of ontological variables onto another set of variables that, amongst themselves,
also completely commute, so that these could also serve as ‘the’ ontological variables. We
can never know which of these sets are the ‘true’ ontological variables, and this means
that the ‘true’ ontological variables are hidden from us. Thus, which operators exactly
are to be called true beables, which are changeables and which are superimposables, will
be hidden from our view. This is why we are happy to adopt the phrase ‘hidden variables’
to describe our ontological variables. Whether or not we can call them ‘invisible’ depends
on the question whether any quantum states can be invisible. That phrase might be
misleading.
For our analysis of Bell’s theorem, this is an important issue. If the true ontological
variables could have been identiﬁed, it would have been possible to deduce, in advance,
how Alice and Bob will choose their settings. The fact that this is now impossible removes
the ‘conspiracy’ aspect ot the CAI.

How essential is the role of gravity?
Quantum gravity is not suﬃciently well understood to allow us to include the gravitational
force in our quantum theories. This may well be the reason why some aspects of this work
are leaving holes and question marks. Gravity is active at the smallest conceivable scale
of physics, which is exactly the scale where we think our theories are most relevant. So
no-one should be surprised that we do not completely succeed in our technical procedures.
As stated, what we would wish to be able to do is to ﬁnd a class of deterministic models
243

that are locally discrete and classical, but that can be cast in a form that can be described
by a quantum ﬁeld theory.
As emphasised before (section 19.1), our quantum ﬁeld theories are described by a
Hamiltonian that is both extensive and bounded from below. It means that the Hamil-
tonian can be written as
H =
Z
d3⃗x T 00(⃗x) .
(22.13)
The operator T 00 is the Hamilton density, and locality and causality in quantum ﬁeld
theory require that, at equal times, t = t0 ,
[T 00(⃗x1, t0), T 00(⃗x2, t0)] = 0
if
⃗x1 ̸= ⃗x2 .
(22.14)
Having diﬃculties recuperating Eq. (22.14) from our cellular automaton, it may be worth
while to observe that the operator T 00 pays the important role of generator of space-
dependent time translations: if we change the metric tensor g00 in the time direction by
an amount δg00(⃗x, t) , then the change in the total action of matter is
δS = 1
2
Z
d3⃗x dt √−g T 00δg00(⃗x, t) ,
(22.15)
(which can actually be seen as a deﬁnition of the stress-energy-momentum tensor T µν ).
Indeed, if we take δg00 to be independent of the space coordinate ⃗x , then the amount of
time that went by is modiﬁed by 1
2
R
δg00dt , which therefore yields a reaction proportional
to the total Hamiltonian H .
The operator
R
d3⃗x √−g T 00(⃗x) f(⃗x) is the generator of a space dependent time trans-
lation: δt = f(⃗x) . One ﬁnds that T µν(⃗x, t) is the generator of general coordinate trans-
formations. This is the domain of gravity. This gives us reasons to believe that quantum
theories in which the Hamiltonian is extrinsic, that is, the integral of local terms T 00(⃗x, t) ,
are intimately connected to quantum gravity. We still have problems formulating com-
pletely self-consistent, unambiguous theories of quantum gravity, while this seems to be
a necessary ingredient for a theory of quantum mechanics with locality.
Apart from the reasons just mentioned, we suspect an essential role for gravity also in
connection with our problem concerning the positivity of the Hamiltonian. In gravity, the
energy density of the gravitational ﬁeld is well-known to be negative. Indeed, Einstein’s
equation,
Tµν −
1
8πGGµν = 0 ,
(22.16)
can be interpreted as saying that the negative energy momentum density of gravity itself,
the second term in Eq. (22.16), when added to the energy momentum tensor of matter,
Tµν , leads to a total energy-momentum tensor that vanishes. The reason why the total
energy-momentum tensor vanishes is that it generates local coordinate transformations,
under which all amplitudes should be invariant.
In section 7, and in subsection 9.3, it was indicated that gravity might be associated
with local information loss. This would then mean that information loss should become
an essential ingredient in theories that explain the emergence of quantum mechanics with
locality from a cellular automaton model with locality built in.

Conclusions of part II
We had three reasons for working out many of our technical exercises in the second part of
this book. First, we wanted to show what techniques can be used to support our assertions
made earlier, which state that there are many ways to link quantum mechanical models
with completely deterministic ones. Most of these deterministic models were chosen just
to demonstrate some points; these were too simple to show delicate structures of direct
physical interest. Some of our models are “computationally universal”, which means that
they contain suﬃcient amounts of complexity to investigate their physical interest [35].
Secondly, we wish to demonstrate that conventional quantum mechanics contains ex-
tensive mathematical tools that can be employed here as well. Fourier expansions, Tay-
lor expansions, unitary transformations in Hilbert space, perturbation expansions, the
Noether theorem, and other well-known procedures, are all extremely useful here. We
wish to sketch the picture that quantum mechanics, as we know it, should be looked
upon as a powerful mathematical tool to handle statistical features of our theories. If the
dynamical equations are too complex to allow us to solve them, the quantum statistical
approach may be the only option we have. No other systematic mathematical machinery
would allow us to examine statistical features of any non-trivial cellular automaton when
stretched over scales a billion times a billion times as large as the elementary scale of the
individual cells. In quantised ﬁeld theories, the tool that makes such jumps over scales is
called the renormalization group.
Thirdly, we do not want to belittle the diﬃculties that are still there. A completely
systematic strategy for constructing models as complex as the Standard Model, has not
yet been found; instead, we found several procedures that could be considered as useful
ingredients for such a strategy, even if still quite incomplete. We emphasise that “no-go”
theorems, such as Bell’s theorem and the CHSH inequalities, do contain the loopholes
that have been pointed out repeatedly. “Super determinism”, abhorred by a majority of
researchers, becomes less fearsome if one realises that it comes with its own conservation
law, the conservation of the ontic nature of a quantum state. To describe our universe,
we have to limit ourselves to the ontic states. These form a very small subset of the
“template states” that are normally used in quantum mechanics. Ontic states can only
evolve into ontic states.
The issue of ‘conspiracy’ may still be worrisome to the reader, even if it is clear that our
theory will not allow us to predict anything about the settings to be used by Alice and Bob.
The notion of ‘free will’ can be addressed without religious or emotional overtones; it is
simply a statement about correlation functions in the initial state. Complete clariﬁcations
of issues such as these may have to wait until more is known about how to handle quantum
ﬁeld theories, such as the Standard Model, in the CAI.
Quite generally, symmetries, symmetry conservation laws and symmetry transforma-
tions, are central not only in conventional quantum mechanics but also in its CA inter-
pretation. A special point was raised in connection with the non-compact, or inﬁnite
symmetry groups, such as the various components of the Poincar´e group. Their Noether
charges are observable in the classical limit, but in the quantum domain these charges
245

do not commute. This means that these charges must be conglomerates of beables and
changeables, and this causes complications in reproducing such symmetries as features in
our cellular automata.
We found a conspicuous property of the quantised strings and superstrings. Without
modifying any of their physics, it was noted that their ontological degrees of freedom
appear to live on a space-time lattice, with a lattice length parameter aspacetime = 2π
√
α ′ .
This not only reﬂects the fact that string theory is ﬁnite, but gives it a clear physical
interpretation.
The Cellular Automaton Interpretation has to deal with more mysteries. We do repro-
duce quantum mechanics exactly, so also the numerous peculiarities and counter intuitive
characteristics of quantum mechanics are duly reproduced.
There are however other
reasons why the most explicit model constructions sketched here are not, or not yet, suﬃ-
ciently reﬁned to serve as models where we can explain all typically quantum mechanical
consequences. A critical reader may rightly point to these obstacles; we bring forward
as our defence that the Cellular Automaton Interpretation of quantum mechanics yields
a considerable amount of clariﬁcation of features of quantum mechanics that have been
shrouded by mysteries over the years: the collapse question, the measurement problem,
Schr¨odinger’s cat, the links between quantum mechanical descriptions and classical de-
scriptions of our world, as well as clear indications as to how to avoid the “many worlds”
as well as the ”pilot waves”. All these came as bonuses, while our real motivation has
always been the question of reconciling the gravitational force with quantum mechanics.
We suspect that the work presented here will be very helpful in achieving such aims.
Not only the interpretation of quantum mechanics, but also some issues in the foun-
dations of quantum ﬁeld theories may be at stake in this approach. We observed that the
procedure of second quantisation may have to be applied not only in the use of quantum
ﬁeld theories, but also for the construction of our Hamiltonian, and this raises issues of
convergence of the perturbation expansion. Our conclusion is now that this expansion
may not converge, just as what we have in quantum ﬁeld theory. Here, however, this
leads us to suggest a novel implication: there is an unavoidable margin of error not only
in our use of quantum ﬁeld theories to calculate particle properties, but a similar margin
of error may also exist in our use of quantum mechanics altogether: quantum calculations
cannot be done with inﬁnite accuracy.

Some remarks on gravity in 2+1 dimensions
Gravity in 2+1 dimensions is a special example of a classical theory that is diﬃcult
to quantise properly, at least if we wish to admit the presence of matter59. One can
think of scalar (spin zero) particles whose only interactions consist of the exchange of a
gravitational force. The classical theory [67][75][76] suggests that it can be quantised, but
something very special happens [78], as we shall illustrate now.
The Einstein equations for regions without matter particles read
Rµν = 0 ,
(A.1)
but in 2+1 dimensions, we can write
Sαβ = Sβα = 1
4εαµνεβκλRµνκλ ,
Rµνκλ = εµναεκλβSαβ ,
Rµν = gµνSαα −Sµν ,
Sµν = −Rµν + 1
2Rgµν .
(A.2)
Consequently, Eq. (A.1) also implies that the Riemann tensor Rµνκλ vanishes. Therefore,
matter-free regions are ﬂat pieces of space-time (which implies that, in 2 + 1 dimensions,
there are no tidal forces).
When a particle is present, however, Rµν does not vanish, and therefore a particle is
a local, topological defect. One ﬁnds that a particle, when at rest, cuts out a wedge from
the 2-dimensional space surrounding it, turning that 2-space into a cone, and the deﬁcit
angle of the excised region is proportional to the mass: In convenient choices of the units,
the total wedge angle is exactly twice the mass µ of the particle.

Figure 21: The angle cut out of space when a particle moves with velocity ξ . See text.
When the particle moves, we choose to orient the wedge with its deﬁcit angle such
that the particle moves in the direction of the bisector of the angle. Then, if we ask
for the eﬀect of the associated Lorentz transformation, we see that the wedge is Lorentz
contracted. This is illustrated in Figure 21, where the crosses indicate which points are
identiﬁed when we follow a loop around the particle. We see that, because we chose the

rather esoteric topological theory.
247

particle to move along the bisector, there is no time shift at this identiﬁcation, otherwise,
there would have been. This way we achieve that the surrounding space can be handled
as a Cauchy surface for other particles that move around.
Some arithmetic shows that, if the particle’s velocity is deﬁned as tanh ξ , the Lorentz
contraction factor is cosh ξ , and the opening angle H of the moving particle is given by
tan H = cosh ξ tan µ .
(A.3)
If η is the velocity of the seam between the two spaces (arrow in Fig. 21), then we ﬁnd
tanh η
=
sin H tanh ξ ,
(A.4)
cos µ
=
cos H cosh η ,
(A.5)
sinh η
=
sin µ sinh ξ .
(A.6)
Eq. (A.3) gives a relation between H and µ that turns into the usual relation between
mass in motion and energy in the weak gravity limit, while deﬁcit angles such as H are
additive and conserved. Therefore, we interpret H as the energy of the moving particle,
in the presence of gravity.
In Ref. [78], we argued that, taking µ to be constant, d(cos H cosh η) = 0 , so that
−sin H cosh η dH + cos H sinh η dη = 0 ,
∂H
∂η = tanh η
tan H .
(A.7)
Furthermore, it was derived that we can make tessellations of Cauchy surfaces using
conﬁgurations such as in Fig. 21 in combination with vertices where no particles are
residing, so that the Cauchy surface is built from polygons. The edges Li where one
polygon is connected to another either end in one of these auxiliary vertices or one of the
physical particles. We can then calculate how the lengths of the edges Li grow or shrink.
Both end points of a boundary line make the line grow or shrink with independent
velocities, but the orthogonal components are the same. To deﬁne these unambiguously,
we take a point such as the small circle in Figure 21, which moves in a direction orthogonal
to the seam. We now see that our particle gives a contribution to dL/dt equal to
dL
dt

ξ = tanh ξ cos H .
(A.8)
Combining this with Eqs. (A.4) and (A.7), one ﬁnds
dL
dt

ξ = tanh η
tan H
= ∂H
∂η .
(A.9)
Furthermore, the Hamiltonian does not depend on L , while η does not depend on time,
so that
dη
dt = −∂H
∂L
= 0 .
(A.10)
248

These last two equations can be seen as the Hamilton equations for L and η . This means
that η and L are canonically associated with one another. If there are many polygons
connected together with seams Li , moving with transverse velocities tanh ηi , then we
obtain Hamiltonian equations for their time dependence, with Poisson brackets
{Li, ηj} = δij .
(A.11)
Thus, the lengths Li are like positions and the ηi are like the associated momenta.
This clearly suggests that all one needs to do to obtain the quantum theory is to postulate
that these Poisson brackets are replaced by commutators.
A.1.
Discreteness of time
There is, however, a serious complication, lying in the nature of our Hamiltonian. If we
have many particles, all adding deﬁcit angles to the shape of our Cauchy surface, one can
easily see what might happen:
If the total energy due to matter particles exceeds the value 2π , the universe
will close into itself, allowing only the value 4π for its total Hamiltonian,
assuming that the universe is simply connected. Thus, the question arises what it means
to vary the Hamiltonian with respect to η ’s, as in Eq. (A.9).
There is a way to handle this question: consider some region X in the universe Ω,
and ask how it evolves with respect to data in the rest of the universe, Ω\X . The problem
is then to deﬁne where the boundary between the two regions X and Ω\X is.
An other peculiar feature of this Hamiltonian is that it is deﬁned as an angle (even
if it might exceed the value 2π ; it cannot exceed 4π ). In the present work, we became
quite familiar with Hamiltonians that are actually simple angles: this means that their
conjugate variable, time, is discrete. The well-deﬁned object is not the Hamiltonian itself,
but the evolution operator over one unit of time: U = e−iH . Apparently, what we are
dealing with here, is a world where the evolution goes in discretised steps in time.
The most remarkable thing however, is that we cannot say that the time for the entire
universe is discrete. Global time is a meaningless concept, because gravity is a diﬀeo-
morphism invariant theory. Time is just a coordinate, and physical states are invariant
under coordinate transformations, such as a global time translation. It is in regions where
matter is absent where we have local ﬂatness, and only in those regions, relative time
is well-deﬁned, and as we know now, discrete. Because of the absence of a global time
concept, we have no Schr¨odinger equation, or even a discrete time-step equation, that
tells us how the entire universe evolves.
Suppose we split the universe Ωinto two parts, X and Ω\X . Then the edges Li
in X obey a Schr¨odinger equation regarding their dependence on a relative time variable
t (it is relative to time in Ω\X ). The Schr¨odinger equation is derived from Eq. (A.5),
where now H and η are operators:
η = −i ∂
∂L ,
H = i ∂
∂t .
(A.12)
249

If the wave function is ψ(L, t) , then
(cos H) ψ(L, t) = 1
2

ψ(L, t + 1) + ψ(L, t −1)

,
(A.13)
and the action of 1/ cosh η on ψ(L, t) can be found by Fourier transforming this operator:
(cosh η)−1ψ(L, t) =
Z ∞
−∞
dy
1
2 cosh(πy/2) ψ(L + y, t) .
(A.14)
So, the particle in Fig. 21 obeys the Schr¨odinger equation following from Eq. (A.5):
ψ(L, t + 1) + ψ(L, t −1) =
Z ∞
−∞
dy
cos µ
cosh(πy/2) ψ(L + y, t) .
(A.15)
The problem with this equation is that it involves all L values, while the polygons
forming the tessellation of the Cauchy surface, whose edge lengths are given by the Li ,
will have to obey inequalities, and therefore it is not clear to us how to proceed from
here. In Ref. [78] we tried to replace the edge lengths Li by the particle coordinates
themselves. It turns out that they indeed have conjugated momenta that form a compact
space, so that these coordinates span some sort of lattice, but this is not a rectangular
lattice, and again the topological constraints were too diﬃcult to handle.
The author now suspects that, in a meaningful theory for a system of this sort, we
must require all dynamical variables to be sharply deﬁned, so as to be able to deﬁne
their topological winding properties. Now that would force us to search for deterministic,
classical models for 2+1 dimensional gravity.
In fact, the diﬃculty of formulating a
meaningful ‘Schr¨odinger equation’ for a 2+1 dimensional universe, and the insight that
this equation would (probably) have to be deterministic, was one of the ﬁrst incentives
for this author to re-investigate deterministic quantum mechanics as was done in the
work reported about here: if we would consider any classical model for 2+1 dimensional
gravity with matter (which certainly can be formulated in a neat way), declaring its
classical states to span a Hilbert space in the sense described in our work, then that could
become a meaningful, unambiguous quantum system [67][75][76].
Our treatment of gravity in 2+1 dimensions suggests that the space-time metric and
the gravitational ﬁelds should be handled as being a set of beables. Could we do the same
thing in 3+1 dimensions? Remember that the source of gravitational ﬁelds, notably the
energy density, is not a beable, unless we decide that the gravitational ﬁelds generated
by energies less than the Planck energy, are negligible anyway (in practice, these ﬁelds
are too feeble to detect), while our considerations regarding the discretised Hamiltonian,
sections 19.2 and 19.3, suggest the one can deﬁne large, discretised, amounts of energy
that indeed behave as beables.
Consider a 3+1 dimensional gravitating system, where one of the space dimensions is
compactiﬁed. It will then turn into a 2+1 dimensional world, which we just argued should
be subject to the CAI. Should our universe not be regarded as just such a world in the
limit where the compactiﬁcation length of the third spacial dimension tends to inﬁnity?
We believe the answer is yes.
250

B.
A summary of our views on Conformal Gravity
Whenever a fundamental diﬃculty is encountered in handling deterministic versions of
quantum mechanics, we have to realise that the theory is intended in particular to apply
to the Planck scale, and that is exactly where the gravitational force cannot be ignored.
Gravity causes several complications when one tries to discretise space and time. One is
the obvious fact that any regular lattice will be fundamentally ﬂat, so we have to address
the question where the Riemann curvature terms can come from. Clearly, we must have
something more complicated that a regular lattice. A sensible suspicion is that we have
a discretisation that resembles a glassy lattice.
But this is not all. We commented earlier on the complications caused by having non-
compact symmetry groups. The Lorentz group generates unlimited contractions both
in the space- and in the time direction. This is also diﬃcult to square with any lattice
structure60
Furthermore, gravity generates black hole states. The occurrence of stellar-sized black
holes is an unavoidable consequence of the theory of General Relativity. They must be
interpreted as exotic states of matter, whose mere existence will have to be accommodated
for in any “complete” theory of Nature. It is conceivable that black holes are just large-
size limits of more regular ﬁeld conﬁgurations at much smaller scales, but this is also far
from being a settled fact. Many theories regard black holes as fundamentally topologically
distinct from other forms of matter such as the ones that occur in stars that are highly
compressed but did not, or not yet, collapse.
To make a link to any kind of cellular automaton (thinking of the glassy types, for
instance), it seems reasonable ﬁrst to construct a theory of gravity where space-time, and
the ﬁelds deﬁned on it, are topologically regular. Consider the standard Einstein-Hilbert
action with a standard, renormalizable ﬁeld theory action for matter added to it:
Ltotal = √−g(LEH + Lmatter) ,
LEH
=
1
16πGN
(R −2Λ) ,
Lmatter

µνGa
µν −¯ψ γµDµ ψ −1

2m2
ϕϕ2 −1
12Rϕ2
−V4(ϕ) −V3(ϕ) −¯ψ(yiϕi + iy5
i γ5ϕi + md)ψ .
(B.1)
Here, Λ is the cosmological constant, ϕ stands for, possibly more than one, scalar matter
ﬁelds, V4 is a quartic interaction, V3 a cubic one, yi and u5
i are scalar and pseudo-scalar
Yukawa couplings, mϕ and md are mass terms, and the term −1
12Rϕ2 is an interaction
between the scalar ﬁelds and the Ricci scalar R that is necessary to keep the kinetic
terms for the ϕ ﬁeld conformally covariant.
Subsequently, one rewrites
gµν = ω2(⃗x, t) ˆgµν ,
ϕ = ω−1 ˆϕ ,
ψ = w−3/2 ˆψ ,
√−g = ω4p
−ˆg ,
(B.2)
60An important comment was delivered by F. Dowker: There is only one type of lattice that reﬂects
perfect Lorentz invariance (and other non-compact symmetries), and this is the completely random lat-
tice. [62]
251

and substitutes this everywhere in the total Lagrangian (B.1).
This leaves a manifest, exact local Weyl invariance in the system:
ˆgµν →Ω2(⃗x, t)ˆgµν
,
ω →Ω(⃗x, t)−1ω ,
ˆϕ →Ω(⃗x, t)−1 ˆϕ
,
ˆψ →Ω(⃗x, t)−3/2 ˆψ .
(B.3)
The substitution (B.2) turns the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian into
1
16πGN
(ω2 ˆR −2 ω4Λ + 6 ˆg µν∂µω ∂νω) .
(B.4)
Rescaling the ω ﬁeld: ω = ˜κχ , ˜κ2 = 4
3πGN , turns this into
1
2ˆgµν∂µχ∂νχ + 1
12 ˆRχ2 −1
6˜κ2Λχ4 .
(B.5)
The resemblance between this Lagrangian for the χ ﬁeld and the kinetic term of the
scalar ﬁelds ϕ in Eq. (B.1), suggests that no singularity should occur when χ →0 , but
we can also conclude directly from the requirement of exact conformal invariance that the
coupling constants should not run, but keep constant values under (global or local) scale
transformations. Note, that χ →0 describes the small-distance limit of the theory.
The theory was originally conceived as an attempt to mitigate the black hole informa-
tion paradox [89], then it was found that it could serve as a theory that determines the
values of physical parameters that up to the present have been theoretically non calcula-
ble (this should follow from the requirement that all renormalization group functions βi
should cancel out to be zero).
For this book, however, a third feature may be important: with judiciously chosen
conformal gauge-ﬁxing procedures, one may end up with models that feature upper limits
on the amount of information that can be stowed in a given volume, or 4-volume, or
surface area.
