Preface
Real Quaternionic Analysis is a multifaceted subject. Created to describe some
phenomena in special relativity, electrodynamics, spin, etc. It has developed into
a body of material that interacts with many branches of mathematics, such as
complex analysis, harmonic analysis, differential geometry, differential equations,
as well as into a ubiquitous factor in the description and elucidation of problems
in mathematical physics. Quaternions have been towards Maxwell’s equations. In
the meantime, real quaternionic analysis has became a well-established branch of
mathematics and greatly successful in many different directions. Quaternions have
been successfully applied to signal processing, most notably pattern recognition.
They can be used for image segmentation, ﬁnding structure based not only upon
color, but repeating patterns. Quaternions may also be used to simplify derivations
in computer vision and robotics, to develop computer applications in virtual reality,
and so on.
This book is intended to provide material for an introductory one- or two-
semester undergraduate course on some of the major aspects of real quaternionic
analysis, with exercises. Alternatively, it may be used in a beginning graduate level
course and as a reference. That it is why, rather than general theorems, we supply
concrete examples and exercises which form the basis of this book. The exercises
proposed at the end of each chapter are an essential part of it. The writing herein is
straightforward and it is addressed to readers who have no prior knowledge of this
subject and who have a basic graduate mathematics background: real and complex
analysis, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations and theory of
distributions.
The detailed reference list proposed at the end is seen as an initial point for the
development of the topics covered in the handbook. From a reader’s point of view,
we chose to present it at the end rather than throughout the text.
Here is a brief description of the topics covered in the ﬁrst ten chapters.
Chapter 1
An introduction to and historical background on the discovery of the
quaternions are provided. The deﬁnitions and general properties of quaternions
are examined in detail.
Chapter 2
The notions of quaternion and spatial rotation are mastered. Some
applications of quaternions to plane geometry are mentioned.
v

vi
Preface
Chapter 3
Studies sequences of quaternion numbers and their properties.
Chapter 4
Reviews the basic properties of quaternion power series and inﬁnite
products.
Chapter 5
The quaternion exponential, logarithmic and power functions are
covered. A brief discussion on the notions of multiple-valued functions and
branches is also presented.
Chapter 6
The quaternion trigonometric functions are deﬁned.
Chapter 7
The quaternion hyperbolic functions are introduced.
Chapter 8
The main focus here is on the study of the inverses of the quaternion
trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and their properties.
Chapter 9
Matrices with quaternion entries are presented. In spite of the
difﬁculties caused by the noncommutativity of the multiplication of quaternions,
we still manage to introduce the concepts of determinant, rank, eigenvalues, and
relations of similarity.
Chapter 10
Studies the concepts of monomials, polynomials and binomials
involving quaternion numbers.
It is with great pleasure that we express our appreciation to all those who have
expressed support, enthusiasm and encouragement in this adventure. We are forever
indebted to our families and close friends for their patience, understanding and

An Introduction to Quaternions
Once we start studying quaternionic analysis we take part in a wonderful experience,
full of insights. This ideology is shown, for instance, when we start describing the
ﬁrst results and pursuing the subject, while the amazement lingers on through the
elegance and smoothness of the results.
Quaternions were discovered on 16th of October 1843 by the Irish mathematician
Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865). His original motivation was to create
a type of hypercomplex numbers related to the three-dimensional space in the
same way as the standard complex numbers are related to the plane. In his ﬁrst
conjecture, complex numbers would need one extra imaginary part, i.e. one real part
and two distinct imaginary parts. For the generalization of the so-called “Theory of
Couplets” to the “Theory of Triplets”, Hamilton had fundamentally in mind the
use of these triplets to represent rotations in the three-dimensional space, just like
complex numbers may be used to represent rotations in the two-dimensional plane.
In his later papers those triplets are termed number vectors. Therefore, it is only
natural that in the attempt to achieve such a construction certain questions have
remained untouched.
It should be noted that even before W.R. Hamilton, a multiplication of 4-vectors
similar to quaternion multiplication, was already known to leading mathematicians
such as Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) and
Olinde Rodrigues (1795–1851).L. Euler discovered in 1748 the four-square identity
and used “quaternion” parameter representations in order to describe motions in
the Euclidean space. This fact was rediscovered by Wilhelm Blaschke (1885–
1962) in his speech on the occasion of the 250th birthday of L. Euler in Berlin
in 1957. C.F. Gauss thought that it made no sense to tell all recent results to his
contemporaries, because they would not understand the implications. In conse-
quence, his results on quaternions remained unpublished during his life, and were
only made public in 1900. O. Rodrigues described a parametrization of general
rotations through four parameters. He used a special multiplication technique which
constitutes an anticipation of the quaternion multiplication.
After nearly 10 years of unsuccessfully searching for a three-dimensional
extension of complex numbers, W.R. Hamilton found himself on the brink of

giving up. He spent years trying to solve this problem without any success; even
his children were aware of his frustrating attempts at these numbers. This sequence
of events is documented in one of his letters to his eldest son Archibald Hamilton,
which we now brieﬂy quote:
Letter from Sir W.R. Hamilton to Rev. Archibald H. Hamilton.
Letter dated August 5, 1865.
MY DEAR ARCHIBALD - (1) I had been wishing for an occasion of corresponding a little
with you on QUATERNIONS: and such now presents itself, by your mentioning in your
note of yesterday, received this morning, that you “have been reﬂecting on several points
connected with them” (the quaternions), “particularly on the Multiplication of Vectors.”
(2) No more important, or indeed fundamental question, in the whole Theory of Quater-
nions, can be proposed than that which thus inquires What is such MULTIPLICATION?
What are its Rules, its Objects, its Results? What Analogies exist between it and other
Operations, which have received the same general Name? And ﬁnally, what is (if any) its
Utility? (3) If I may be allowed to speak of myself in connexion with the subject, I might
do so in a way which would bring you in, by referring to an ante-quaternionic time, when
you were a mere child, but had caught from me the conception of a Vector, as represented
by a Triplet: and indeed I happen to be able to put the ﬁnger of memory upon the year and
month - October, 1843 - when having recently returned from visits to Cork and Parsonstown,
connected with a meeting of the British Association, the desire to discover the laws of the
multiplication referred to regained with me a certain strength and earnestness, which had
for years been dormant, but was then on the point of being gratiﬁed, and was occasionally
talked of with you. Every morning in the early part of the above-cited month, on my coming
down to breakfast, your (then) little brother William Edwin, and yourself, used to ask me,
“Well, Papa, can you multiply triplets”? Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad
shake of the head: “No, I can only add and subtract them.”
But on the 16th day of the same month—which happened to be a Monday, and a
Council day at the Royal Irish Academy—while walking along the Royal Canal
in Dublin with his wife, W.R. Hamilton was struck by inspiration. Instead of the
two imaginary parts as he had ﬁrst considered, he imagined a three part imaginary
system. In Hamilton’s own words:
Tomorrow will be the ﬁfteenth birthday of the Quaternions. They started into life, or light,
full grown, on the 16th of October, 1843, as I was walking with Lady Hamilton to Dublin,
and came up to Brougham Bridge. That is to say, I then and there felt the galvanic circuit of
thought closed, and the sparks which fell from it were the fundamental equations between
i, j , k, exactly such as I have used them ever since. I pulled out, on the spot, a pocketbook,
which still exists, and made an entry, on which, at the very moment, I felt that it might be
worth my while to expend the labour of at least ten (or it might be ﬁfteen) years to come.
But then it is fair to say that this was because I felt a problem to have been at the moment
solved, an intellectual want relieved, which had haunted me for at least ﬁfteen years before.
So struck was W.R. Hamilton with his discovery that he drew his pocketknife and
into a stone of Broome Bridge in Dublin he carved the famous formulae with the
symbols i, j, k:
i2 D j 2 D k2 D ijk D 1:
Thus, the Quaternions were born. What W.R. Hamilton had imagined was a number
with one real component and three distinct imaginary components, all of the

1.1

3
imaginary components squaring to 1. Unfortunately,the carvings no longer remain
today. Nevertheless, his discovery was so signiﬁcant that every year on October
16, the Mathematics Department of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth,
holds a Hamilton Walk to Broome Bridge commemorating his discovery. This is the
breakthrough concerning the designation of quaternions—from the Latin quaternio,
meaning “set of four”.
W.R. Hamilton presented quaternion mathematics at a series of lectures at
the Royal Irish Academy. The lectures gave rise to a book, whose full title is:
“Lectures on quaternions: containing a systematic statement of a new mathematical
method, of which the principles were communicated in 1843 to the Royal Irish
academy, and which has since formed the subject of successive courses of lectures,
delivered in 1848 and subsequent years, in the halls of Trinity college, Dublin:
with numerous illustrative diagrams, and with some geometrical and physical
applications”.
Leaving history behind us, the next portion of text intends to introduce the
reader to the modern terminology and basic notations used to describe quaternions.
The standard properties and the arithmetics of quaternions are presented. It will
be shown that quaternions have a simple four-dimensional character, leading to a
straightforward geometric description. When necessary, some important construc-
tions are explained in full detail. And for the reader’s convenience and sake of easy
reference, from now on the main results exploited here are systematically stated and
proved step-by-step. Nevertheless, a rigorous development has to be replaced by a
logical one based upon suitable deﬁnitions in order to agree with the given notation.
In doing so, this will allow us to fully concentrate on examples and exercises since
our experience has shown that this methodology is useful for someone who is
introduced to the subject for the ﬁrst time.
W.R. Hamilton called the new numbers
p WD a C bi C cj C dk
.a; b; c; d 2 R/
real quaternions (or more informally, Hamilton numbers). The set of all real
quaternions is often denoted by H, in honour of its discoverer. We note that it is
possible to consider a more general structure, which is of no particular interest
for our objectives; known as the algebra of complex quaternions (or biquaternion
algebra).
1.1
Basic Units
For the remainder of this section, 1, i, j, and k will denote both imaginary basis
units of H and a basis for R4. For the sake of clarity, the Hamiltonian rule
i2 D j 2 D k2 D ijk D 1

An Introduction to Quaternions
may also be written as:
ij D k D ji;
jk D i D kj;
and
ki D j D ik:
(1.1)
In particular, the elements i, j, k pairwise anticommute. When convenient, it can be
very useful to use another representation of quaternions, which will be introduced
in the following. Geometrically speaking, a quaternion which is initially given in
the form p D a C bi C cj C dk can be unequivocally associated to an ordered
quadruple of real numbers .a; b; c; d/. The starting point for this consideration is
the identiﬁcation of the basis elements of R4, .1; 0; 0; 0/, .0; 1; 0; 0/, .0; 0; 1; 0/ and
.0; 0; 0; 1/, with the basis of H, 1, i, j, and k, respectively. As a matter of fact,
throughout the text we will often use the same symbol to represent a point in R4 as
well as the corresponding quaternion.
1.2
Scalar and Vector Parts
The notations p D aCibCjcCkd and p D aCbiCcjCdk are interchangeable. The
real number p0 WD a in p is called the scalar part of p and p WD bi C cj C dk is the
vector part of p. The scalar and vector parts of a real quaternion p are also often
abbreviated as Sc.p/ and Vec.p/, respectively. For example, if p D 1Ci C4j C3k,
then p0 D 1 and p D i C 4j C 3k. The real numbers are precisely those with zero
vector part. In addition, if p D p, then p is called a pure imaginary quaternion
or, simply, pure quaternion.1 For example, p D j C k is a pure quaternion. If p1
and p2 are two quaternions, we generally do not deﬁne inequalities like p1  p2
unless p1 and p2 are real numbers. The words positive and negative are not applied
to quaternions either, and the use of these words implies that we are dealing again
with real numbers.
1.3
Convention
Even though every quaternion p can be uniquely associated to a vector .a; b; c; d/T
in R4 (hereby transposition shows that in general vectors should be written
as column vectors), one can often deﬁne a vector to mean a pure quaternion.
Ultimately, this convention can be reduced so that a vector is an element of the
vector space R3. In other courses you have undoubtedly seen that the numbers in an
ordered triple of real numbers can be interpreted as the components of a vector in R3.
Thus, a (pure) quaternion p can also be viewed as a three-dimensional position
vector, that is, a vector whose initial point is the origin and whose terminal point is
.b; c; d/. Even nowadays, Hamilton’s notation i, j, and k for the basis elements in
R3 is often used in engineering lectures. Thus a vector in the sense of Hamilton is
representable in the form p WD bi C cj C dk.
1Hamilton called pure imaginary quaternions right quaternions and real numbers scalar
quaternions.

1.5
Arithmetic Operations
5
Because of the previous correspondence between a pure quaternion p D bi C
cj C dk and one and only one point .b; c; d/ in R3, we shall from now on use the
terms pure quaternion and point in R3 interchangeably.
1.4
Equality
Two quaternions p D a1 C b1i C c1j C d1k and q D a2 C b2i C c2j C d2k are
equal, p D q, when the individual coordinates are equal: a1 D a2, b1 D b2, c1 D c2
and d1 D d2. In terms of the scalar and vector parts, the last statement means that
p D q if p0 D q0 and p D q.
1.5
Arithmetic Operations
Quaternions can be added, subtracted and multiplied. If p D a1 C b1i C c1j C d1k,
q D a2 C b2i C c2j C d2k and  is a real number, these operations are deﬁned as
follows:
(i) Addition
p C q WD .a1 C a2/ C .b1 C b2/i C .c1 C c2/j C .d1 C d2/k;
(ii) Subtraction
p  q WD .a1  a2/ C .b1  b2/i C .c1  c2/j C .d1  d2/k;
(iii) Real multiplication
p WD .a1/ C .b1/i C .c1/j C .d1/k;
(iv) Quaternion multiplication
pq WD .a1a2  b1b2  c1c2  d1d2/ C .a1b2 C b1a2 C c1d2  d1c2/i
C .a1c2  b1d2 C c1a2 C d1b2/j C .a1d2 C b1c2  c1b2 C d1a2/k.
There are several ways to assemble Rule (iv). For the considerations to follow
we use the (left-)distributivity of multiplication over addition; then the quaternion
multiplication of p and q becomes
pq WD .a1 C b1i C c1j C d1k/.a2 C b2i C c2j C d2k/
D a1a2 C a1b2i C a1c2j C a1d2k C b1a2i C b1b2i2 C b1c2ij C b1d2ik
C c1a2j C c1b2ji C c1c2j 2 C c1d2jk C d1a2k C d1b2ki C d1c2kj
C d1d2k2:
Notice that we must be careful simplifying this last step because although
multiplication is commutative for real numbers, this is no longer true for imaginary
elements. Using then the basic properties of quaternions and identities (1.1), we can
rewrite the multiplication again:
pq D a1a2 C a1b2i C a1c2j C a1d2k C b1a2i  b1b2 C b1c2k  b1d2j
C c1a2j  c1b2k  c1c2 C c1d2i C d1a2k C d1b2j  d1c2i  d1d2:

An Introduction to Quaternions
Regrouping the terms according to the imaginary units, we ﬁnally get Rule (iv).
A detailed veriﬁcation of the remaining rules is left to the reader.
If we take the expressions above as the deﬁnitions of addition and multiplication,
it is a simple matter to verify that the familiar associativity, and distributivity laws
of multiplication over addition hold for quaternions:
(v) Commutativity law of addition
p C q D q C p for all p; q 2 H;
(vi) Associativity law of addition
p C .q C r/ D .p C q/ C r for all p; q; r 2 H;
(vii) Distributivity law of multiplication over addition
p.q C r/ D pq C pr and .q C r/p D qp C rp for all p; q; r 2 H;
(viii) Associativity law of multiplication
.pq/r D p.qr/ for all p; q; r 2 H.
Exercise 1.1. Prove the previous properties.
All that is needed to understand the deﬁnitions of addition, subtraction, and
multiplication is:
(i) To add (subtract) two quaternions, simply add (subtract) the corresponding
scalar and vector parts, or simply use the usual sum (subtraction) of two vectors
in R4;
(ii) To multiply two real quaternions, use the distributivity law of multiplication
over addition or use the following scheme:

Although addition is commutative, the same does not hold for multiplication: for
example, ij D k, while ji D k. Therefore, in general, pq is not equal to qp.

The deﬁnition of division deserves further elaboration, and so we will discuss
this point in more detail shortly.
1.6
Special Quaternions
It is clear that the quaternion 0 C 0i C 0j C 0k DW 0H is the neutral element of
addition, known as additive identity quaternion, and the quaternion 1 C 0i C 0j C
0k DW 1H is the multiplicative identity quaternion. They are such that any quaternion
added or multiplied by them remains unchanged. If we take a previous expression
as the deﬁnition of addition, it is a simple matter to verify that the inverse element
of p with respect to addition is p. The inverse with respect to multiplication will
be further detailed below. In summary, the real quaternions form a noncommutative
division algebra, the skew ﬁeld2 of the real quaternions H. The quaternions remain
the simplest algebra after the real and complex numbers. Indeed, the real numbers,
the complex numbers, and the quaternions are the only associative division algebras,
2A skew ﬁeld is an algebraic structure that satisﬁes all the properties of a ﬁeld except for
commutativity.

An Introduction to Quaternions
as was proved by Georg Frobenius (1849–1917); and amongst these the quaternions
are the most general. Since any complex number a C bi can be written as a C bi C
0j C 0k, we see that the set of complex numbers can be regarded as a subset of H.
We could also have chosen j or k to play the role of the imaginary unit i D
p
1
in classical complex analysis.
The assumption ij D ji is incompatible with the request that H is a skew
symmetric ﬁeld. Even though it may not be so common, it is possible to consider
such a structure, which is of independent interest and is known as the commutative
ring of bicomplex numbers.

Decomposition of Quaternions
Quaternions can be conveniently decomposed in two ways: p D a C ib C cj C idj
or p D pC C p D 1
2.p C ipj/ C 1
2.p  ipj/. In this connection, for the second
decomposition it holds that

Roots
In the sequel, let q be a real quaternion and n 2 N. As a brief preview of the material
in Chap. 5, a quaternion p is called (an) n-th root of q if pn D q. The noncommuta-
tivity of multiplication has some unexpected consequences, for instance, polynomial
equations over the quaternions can have more distinct solutions than the degree of
the polynomial. For example, the equation p2 C 1H D 0H has an inﬁnite number of
pure quaternion solutions p D bi C cj C dk with b2 C c2 C d 2 D 1. To see this, let
p D a C bi C cj C dk be a quaternion, and assume that its square is 1H. In terms
of a, b, c, and d, this leads to the following equations: a2  b2  c2  d 2 D 1,
2ab D 0, 2ac D 0, and 2ad D 0. To satisfy the last three equations, either a D 0
or b, c, and d are all 0. The latter is impossible because a is a real number and the
ﬁrst equation would imply that a2 D 1; therefore a D 0 and b2 C c2 C d 2 D 1.
As the above discussion shows, a quaternion squares to 1H if and only if it is a
vector in R3 with norm 1. Therefore, these solutions form a two-dimensional sphere
centered at zero in the three-dimensional subspace of pure imaginary quaternions.
This sphere intersects the complex plane at the two poles i and i, respectively.3
1.9
Quaternion Conjugation
The quaternion p WD p0  p D a  bi  cj  dk associated with the quaternion
p WD a C bi C cj C dk, deﬁned by reversing the sign of the vector part of p, is
called the conjugate quaternion of p. For example, if p D 1  2i C 3j C k, then
p D 1C2i 3j k; if p D 1j Ck, then p D 1Cj k. Notice that replacing
i by i, j by j, and k by k sends a vector in R3 to its additive inverse, so the
additive inverse of a vector in R3 is the same as its conjugate as a pure quaternion.
For this reason, conjugation is sometimes called the spatial inverse. The quaternion
conjugation can also be useful to extract the scalar and vector parts of p. In this
sense, the scalar part of p is .p C p/=2, and the vector part of p is .p  p/=2. For
all p, q 2 H and  2 R, the mapping p 7! p has the following properties:
(i) p ˙ q D p ˙ q;
(ii) p D p;
(iii) p D p;
(iv) pq D q p;
(v) p 2 R , p D p;
(vi) p is a pure quaternion , p D p.
The deﬁnitions of addition and multiplication show that the sum and the product
of a real quaternion p D aCbiCcjCdk with its conjugate p are real numbers: p C
p D .aCbiCcjCdk/C.abicjdk/ D 2a, and pp D .aCbiCcjCdk/.abi
cjdk/ D a2Cb2Cc2Cd 2. The difference of a real quaternion p with its conjugate
p is a pure quaternion: pp D .aCbiCcjCdk/.abicjdk/ D 2biC2cjC2dk.
Properties (i) and (iv) can be extended to three or more quaternions. For example
3For all real angles  and , it is easy to check that p D cos  cos i C cos  sin j C sin k is a
square root of 1H. This gives the set of all the points on the unit sphere in R3 and shows that the
set of “quaternionic square roots of minus one” has inﬁnitely many square roots.

Quaternion Modulus and Quaternion Inverse
Associated with every quaternion is a nonnegative real number, which we now
deﬁne. The modulus or absolute value4 of a real quaternion p D a C bi C cj C dk
is denoted by jpj and is identical to the notion of Euclidean length in R4, so that it
is clearly the distance from the origin to the point .a; b; c; d/. More precisely, we
deﬁne the modulus of p by the expression jpj WD
p
a2 C b2 C c2 C d 2. If jpj D 1,
the quaternion is called a unit quaternion. Using conjugation and the modulus makes
it possible to deﬁne the multiplicative inverse of a quaternion p in such a way that
the product of a quaternion with its inverse (in either order) is 1H. In symbols,
for p ¤ 0H there exists one and only one nonzero quaternion p1 such that
pp1 D p1p D 1H. The inverse of a unit quaternion is its conjugate. In particular,
the following properties hold:
(i) pp D pp D jpj2;
(ii) p1 D
p
jpj2 , p ¤ 0H;
(iii) jpqj D jpjjqj;
(iv) jpj D j  pj D jpj;
(v) .pq/1 D q1p1; pq ¤ 0H.
Statement (ii) shows that the quaternions are indeed a skew ﬁeld, that means, every
nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Statement (iii) shows that the product
pq is a quaternion and so a vector in R4. The equality jpqj D jpjjqj hints that
the length of the quaternion pq is exactly the product of the lengths of the individual
quaternions p and q. For simplicity we only prove Statements (ii) and (v). A detailed
veriﬁcation of the remaining properties is left to the reader. We can easily verify
Statement (ii) by performing the multiplication
4Hamilton called this quantity the tensor of p, but nowadays this concept conﬂicts with modern
usage.

1.11
Quaternion Quotient
With regard to the concept of quaternion inverse discussed above and due to the
noncommutativity of multiplication, we assume familiarity with the fact that the
quotient of two quaternions p and q may be interpreted in two different ways.

12

An Introduction to Quaternions
That is, their quotient can be either pq1 or q1p. In this sense, the notation p
q
is ambiguous because it does not specify whether q divides on the left or the right.
Namely, pq1 D
p q
jqj2 , and q1p D
q p
jqj2 . For conciseness the ﬁrst is called right
quotient and the second left quotient. It is signiﬁcant to note that when p and q are
pure quaternions then the right and left quotients, pq1 and q1p, are quaternion
conjugates. Take for example p D i C j and q D k. The right and left quotients of
p and q are, respectively, pq1 D i C j and q1p D i  j. We further note that
pq1 D i  j D q1p.

Triangle Inequalities
Although the concept of order in the real number system does not carry over to the
quaternion number system, since jpj is a real number we can compare the moduli
of two real quaternions. For example, if p D 1  2i and q D i  j C k, then
jpj D
p
5 and jqj D
p
3 and, consequently, jpj > jqj. We record now some useful
inequalities. Let p and q be quaternions, then for the modulus we have
(i) jpj  p0  jpj and jpj  jpj  jpj, that is jp0j  jpj and jpj  jpj;
(ii) jp ˙ qj  jpj C jqj;
(iii) jjpj  jqjj  jp ˙ qj.
For simplicity we only sketch the proof of jjpj  jqjj  jp C qj. A detailed
veriﬁcation of the remaining inequalities is left to the reader. From the identity
p D p C q C .q/, Statement (ii) gives jpj  jp C qj C j  qj. Since jqj D j  qj,
solving the last inequality for jp C qj yields the relation jp C qj  jpj  jqj.
Now because p C q D q C p, the last inequality can be rewritten as jp C qj D
jq C pj  jqj  jpj D .jpj  jqj/, and so combined with the last relation implies
jp C qj  jjpj  jqjj. The triangle inequality: jp C qj  jpj C jqj indicates that the
length of the quaternion pCq cannot exceed the sum of the lengths of the individual
quaternions p and q. In addition, we note that this inequality extends to any ﬁnite
sum of quaternions, so that jp1 C p2 C    C pnj  jp1j C jp2j C    C jpnj.
Example. Consider two quaternions p and q. Under what circumstances does jp C
qj D jpj C jqj hold?
Solution. Let p D p0Cp1i Cp2j Cp3k and q D q0Cq1i Cq2j Cq3k. It is readily
veriﬁed that jp C qj D jpj C jqj is equivalent to jp C qj2 D jpj2 C jqj2 C 2jpjjqj.
The last equality is only possible if pl D ql .l D 0; 1; 2; 3/ for some  > 0. Hence
p  q . > 0/.

By the early 1880s, Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903)introduced the dot product
and cross product of vectors. Gibbs recognized that a pure quaternion could be
interpreted as a vector, which allowed him to build the basis of a vectorial system.
Historically, vector analysis developed by Gibbs and his collaborators is seen as the
origin of practical applications of physics and engineering, which were missing in
the more complicated quaternion language.
1.13
Quaternion Dot Product
The dot product of two real quaternions p and q is a real number, deﬁned as the sum
of the quantity of each element of p multiplied by each element of q, that is
p  q WD p0q0 C p  q:
Take for example p D 1Ci Cj Ck and q D 12i C3j C5k. A simple calculation
shows that p  q D 1  2 C 3 C 5 D 7. The quaternion dot product is also referred
to as the Euclidean inner product for vectors in R4, as it returns a scalar quantity.
If p  q D 0, then p and q are orthogonal to each other. This product can be used to
extract any component from a given quaternion. For instance, the i component can
be extracted from p D a C bi C cj C dk by taking p  i D b. Also, it holds that

Quaternion Cross Product
In the sequel, consider two pure quaternions p D p1i C p2j C p3k and q D
q1i C q2j C q3k. The quaternion cross product is also known as the odd product.
It is equivalent to the vector cross product, and returns a vector quantity only:
p  q WD Vec.pq/:

An Introduction to Quaternions
This evidences that the noncommutativity of multiplication comes from the
multiplication of pure quaternions. In order to tie these matters up, we notice that
two quaternions commute if and only if their vector parts are coplanar or collinear.
In particular,
p2 D .p2

since p  p D 0H.

Mixed Product
For three pure quaternions p, q, and r,
.p; q; r/ WD p  .q  r/
is called their mixed product. The mixed product has the following properties:
(i) It deﬁnes a trilinear vector form, i.e. it is R-homogeneous and distributive in
each component. For example,
.p; sq1 C tq2; r/ D s.p; q1; r/ C t.p; q2; r/;
s; t 2 RI
(ii) It does not change if its factors are circularly permuted, but changes sign if
they are switched, so that
.p; q; r/ D .q; r; p/ D .r; p; q/ D .q; p; r/ D .p; r; q/ D .r; q; p/I
(iii) The absolute value of the mixed product represents the oriented volume of the
parallelepiped spanned by the three pure quaternions that meet in the same
vertex. It follows that
.p; q; r/ D jpjjqjjrj sin †.p; q/ cos †.p  q; r/:
Therefore, the mixed product vanishes if and only if the three pure quaternions
are collinear;
(iv) The determinant representation holds:

The above deﬁnitions centered most use of quaternions around the vector part,
while neglecting the scalar part. Some of the neat mathematical characteristics of
quaternions are indeed their algebraic properties (like division, which is missing
for modern vectors). In fact, the properties of the multiplication and division of
quaternions and the law of the moduli enable one to treat quaternions as numbers, in
the same way as complex numbers. This makes it possible to do interesting research,
e.g. to derive closed form solutions for algebraic systems involving unknown
rotational parameters. This contributed to the development of the modern theory
of vectors.
We proceed by recalling the notion of polar coordinate system from calculus,
ﬁrstly invented in 1637 by René Descartes (1596–1650), and taken up several
decades after by Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1726) and Daniel Bernoulli (1700–
1782), among others. The polar coordinate system consists of a two-dimensional
coordinate system in which each point P on a plane whose rectangular coordinates
are .x; y/ is determined by the distance from a ﬁxed point and the angle made with a

22
1
An Introduction to Quaternions
ﬁxed direction. The ﬁxed point O (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian system) is
called the pole, and the horizontal half-line emanating from the pole with the ﬁxed
direction is the polar axis. If r is a directed distance from the pole to P , known as
radial coordinate or radius, and the polar angle  (also known as angular coordinate
or azimuth) is the angle of rotation measured from the polar axis to the line OP , then
the point P can be described by the ordered pair .r; /, called the polar coordinates
of P .
1.21
Polar Form of a Quaternion
Let p be a real quaternion such that p ¤ .0; 0; 0/. The quaternion p can also be
associated with an angle  via
cos  D p0
jpj
and
sin  D jpj
jpj:
This superimposed argument is in some sense correct since, obviously,
1  cos   1;
1  sin   1;
and
cos2  C sin2  D 1:
Every nonzero quaternion p can be written in polar form5
p D jpj

cos  C p
jpj sin 

:
(1.4)
We say that (1.4) is the polar representation of the quaternion p. In a polar
coordinate system the angle  is viewed as the angle between the vector p in R4 and
the real axis (the subspace of real numbers), and jpj
jpj sin  as the projection of p onto
the subspace R3 of pure quaternions. Furthermore, the angle  is always measured
in radians, and is positive when measured counterclockwise and negative when
measured clockwise. As usual, radians can conveniently express angle measures
in terms of . For example, an angle of 
2 radians is equal to an angle of 90ı and an
angle of  radians is equal to an angle of 180ı.
For any p 2 H with p ¤ .0; 0; 0/, we clearly have the equality

Quaternion Sign and Quaternion Argument
The quaternion sign produces the unit quaternion, sgn.p/ D
p
jpj. The angle  is
called the quaternion argument or amplitude of the quaternion p and is denoted
by  WD arg.p/. An argument can be assigned to any nonzero real quaternion p.
However, for p D 0H, arg.p/ cannot be deﬁned in any way that is meaningful.
Also, an argument of a real quaternion p is not unique, since cos  and sin  are
2-periodic functions. That means if 0 is an argument of p, then necessarily the
angles 0 ˙ 2n for any integer n are also arguments of p, and we can sometimes
think of arg.p/ as f ˙ 2n W n 2 Ng. In practice, when p ¤ 0H we use tan  D jpj
p0
to ﬁnd , where the quadrant in which p0 and jpj lie must always be speciﬁed or be
clearly understood.

Quaternion Argument of a Product
The polar form of a quaternion is especially convenient when multiplying two pure
quaternions with proportional vector parts. If we consider a unit pure quaternion
p (i.e. such that jpj D 1), then it is undoubtedly clear that p2 D 1H, as has
already been discussed. Therefore, the product of two unit pure quaternions with
proportional vector parts p D jpj.cos  C p sin / and q D jqj.cos  C p sin /
yields the following de Moivre’s type formula for pure quaternions:
pq D jpjjqj .cos. C / C p sin. C // :
From this it is evident that the argument of pq is given by arg.p C q/ D arg.p/ C
arg.q/.
1.24
Principal Argument
Although the symbol arg.p/ actually represents a set of values, the argument  of
a quaternion that lies in the interval 0     is called (by analogy with the
complex case) the principal value of arg.p/ or the principal argument of p. The
principal argument of p is unique and is denoted by the symbol Arg.p/, that is,
Arg.p/ 2 Œ0; . In general, arg.p/ and Arg.p/ are related by arg.p/ D Arg.p/ C
2n; n D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : : . For example, arg.i C j C k/ D 
2 C 2n, n 2 Z. For the
choices n D 0 and n D 1, it follows that arg.i C j C k/ D Arg.i C j C k/ D 

In the preceding part of text we have seen that quaternions are indeed related
to both real and complex numbers. Just as complex numbers can be represented as
matrices, so can quaternions. One of the effective approaches in studying matrices
of quaternions is to convert a given real quaternion into a 2  2 complex matrix,
and the other is to use a 4  4 real matrix. In the terminology and methodology
of abstract algebra, these are injective homomorphisms from H to the matrix rings
M2.C/ and M4.R/, respectively. The ﬁrst group is important for describing spin
in quantum mechanics, which is intimately related with the widely known Pauli
matrices.6 Although they visualize quaternions well (see the matrix representation
below), the latter representation is not particularly useful because 4  4 matrices

Quaternions and Spatial Rotation
The particularly rich theory of rotations does not need advertising. One can think
of a rotation as a transformation in the plane or in space that describes the position
and orientation of a three-dimensional rigid body around a ﬁxed point. The ﬁrst ever
study of rotations was published by L. Euler in 1776. Since then the analysis of 3D
rotations has been the object of intensive study in many ﬁelds such as, for example,
computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, navigation, molecular dynamics and
orbital mechanics of satellites. As the reader will soon discover, unit quaternions
are very efﬁcient for analyzing situations in which rotations in R3 are involved.
Due to the buildup of computational errors, the quaternion might become of non-
unit length. Nevertheless, this can be ﬁxed by dividing the quaternion by its norm.
In contrast to the Euler angles, unit quaternions are very simple to compose and
avoid the gimbal lock problem (discontinuities). Besides this, compared to rotation
matrices they are numerically much more stable and may be more efﬁcient. For
these reasons, quaternions are commonly used in computer graphics and navigation
systems.
In this chapter we shall brieﬂy discuss the close connection between quaternions
and rotations. This is exactly what this part will try to examine. It does not add
any application to rotation interpolation (for which excellent surveys already exist)
but gives an overview of the problems which thus arise. The underlying quaternion
technique will also allow us to easily compose rotations and to understand their
geometric meaning. The rotations that we will discuss here are rotations about the
origin, a ﬁtting point to the present exposition.
To start with, each unit vector is to be considered as an axis of rotation and the
quaternion that represents a rotation about that axis is to be associated with the
vector. To sidestep this issue we shall understand how to turn a rotation about one
axis into a rotation about another axis. The key point is a similarity transformation,
which we now deﬁne:

Quaternions and Spatial Rotation
2.1
Rotations
Let p be an arbitrary quaternion. For every quaternion q ¤ 0H, the mapping q
in H deﬁned by q.p/ WD qpq1 is called rotation. We have then the following
properties:
(i) R-linearity
q.1p1 C 2p2/ D 1q.p1/ C 2q.p2/ for all p1; p2 2 H, 1; 2 2 R;
(ii) Multiplicativity
q.p1 p2/ D q.p1/ q.p2/ for all p1; p2 2 H;
(iii) q is an isometric automorphism of H;
(iv) q.p1/  q.p2/ D p1  p2 for all p1; p2 2 H;
(v) q1q2.p/ D q1q2.p/ for all q1; q2 2 H n f0Hg.
For simplicity we only sketch the proofs of Properties (iii)–(v). A detailed veriﬁca-
tion of the remaining statements is left to the reader. Obviously, 1
q
W p 7! q1pq,
and 1

corresponds to the inverse of q; also, 1

Exercise 2.58. Let p, q1 and q2 be quaternions such that q1; q2 ¤ 0H. Show that
q1.p/ and q2.p/ yield the same rotation if and only if q1 D q2 for some real
number  ¤ 0.
The next example provides an alternative way of computing q.p/.

Suppose that we restrict ourselves to purely imaginary quaternions p in the
mapping q. Let us emphasize that q.p/ is again a pure quaternion, so that the
scalar part of q.p/ does not exist. Thus q.p/ is also an automorphism of R3
with the properties described above. Furthermore, q.p/ in R3 is invariant under
the vector product, namely
q.p1/  q.p2/ D 1

In summary, the mapping q is an automorphism of R3 that leaves the canonical
scalar product invariant. Following the above calculations, it is homomorphic with
respect to the vector product.
Exercise 2.59. Let p1 D 2i Cj Ck, p2 D j k, and q D j. Find q.p1/q.p2/.

2.2
Composition of Rotations
From a computational point of view, the quaternion representation of rotation
simpliﬁes the computation of composite rotations. Consider two rotations q1 and
q2 speciﬁed by two unit quaternions q1 and q2. The action of the composite rotation
q2 ı q1 on a pure quaternion p, which is obtained by ﬁrst applying the rotation
induced by q1 and then applying the rotation induced by q2, is the same as applying
the single rotation induced by the product q2q1, namely
.q2 ı q1/.p/ D q2.q1.p//
D q2.q1pq1
1 /q1
2
D .q2q1/p.q1
1 q1
2 /
D .q2q1/p.q2q1/1 D q2q1.p/:
Since q1 and q2 are unit quaternions, it is evident that the product q2q1 is also a
unit quaternion. Accordingly, q2q1.p/ describes a rotation operator whose deﬁning
quaternion is the product of the two quaternions q1 and q2. Thus the axis and
the angle of the composite rotation are given by the product q2q1. Similarly,
the quaternion product q1q2 deﬁnes an operator .q1q2/1, which represents the
composition of the operator q1
1
followed by q1
2 . The axis and angle of rotation of
.q1q2/1 are those represented by the quaternion product q1q2. In addition, we note
that these considerations can be extended to the composition of any ﬁnite number
of rotations.
Exercise 2.62. Let q1 D i, q2 D j and p D i C j. Find .q2 ı q1/.p/.
Solution. i C j.

Quaternions and Spatial Rotation
Exercise 2.63. Let q1, q2 and q3 be unit quaternions. What rotation is represented
by the quaternion product q1q3q2? Answer by specifying its rotation angle and axis.
Solution. It is a composition of tree rotations, q1 ı q3 ı q2.
We make the following geometric observations concerning a quaternion q, its
inverse q1 and its inverse with respect to addition q:
(i) The inverse of q, q1, reverses the direction of rotation. Notice, in particular,
that q1

q.p/

D q1.qpq1/q D p;
(ii) It can be easily seen that q.p/ D .q/p.q/1 D q.p/. Therefore the
quaternion q represents exactly the same rotation as q.
Exercise 2.64. Let q1 D 1  i  j  k, q2 D 1
2.1 C i C j C k/, and p D 101i 
1;031j  76k. Find q1.q2.p// and .q1q2/1.p/.
Solution. q1.q2.p// D .q1q2/1.p/ D 101i  1;031j  76k.
Next we address the issue of computing the matrix representation of a rotation.

The veriﬁcation of these statements is not difﬁcult and is left to the reader. It

a rotation about the origin in four-dimensional Euclidean space. On noting that

Suppose that we restrict ourselves to the action of the mapping q on purely
imaginary quaternions p. As we will see, for any pure quaternion p the action of q
on p is equivalent to a rotation of p through an angle  about the axis of rotation q.
To explore this further, we need to study the properties of the automorphism q in
R3.
Next we discuss the effect of a rotation through an angle  about an axis passing
through the origin.
2.4
Quaternion Representation of Rotations
Let p be a pure quaternion. In case q is a unit quaternion, q.p/ represents a
counterclockwise rotation by the angle 2 arccos.q0/ (measured between 0 and 2)
with axis pointing in the direction of q. We set
q0 WD cos 
2  0;
and
q WD p
jpj sin 
2 :
If q D .0; 0; 0/, then q D ˙1H, which gives rise to the identity rotation ( is either
0 or ). Therefore, we may assume that jqj ¤ 0. Any unit quaternion q can be
written as

2.4
Quaternion Representation of Rotations
43
q D cos 
2 C p
jpj sin 
2 ;
(2.2)
where the angle of rotation  is equal to  when q0 D 0, and when q0 ¤ 0, choosing
a suitable orientation of the plane orthogonal to the axis of rotation, is given by
tan 
2 D
jqj
q0 , with 0 <   . It is evident that q gives the direction of the axis
of rotation, and  can be recovered from the scalar part and the magnitude of the
vector part. The underlying two conditions,
q0 D cos 
2 ;
and
jqj2 D sin2 
2 ;
are consistent since, obviously we have jqj2 D q2
0 C jqj2 D 1. We can add any
multiple of 360ı to  without affecting the rotation. Notice, in particular, that the
effect of a rotation through an angle  in the opposite direction can be calculated by
replacing  by  in the representation (2.2). One can check directly that

In particular,

Now we choose a pure unit quaternion p1 perpendicular to q. Hence,

then .p1; p2; p3/ is an orthonormal basis of R3 with p1  p2 D p3. Relying on (2.3),

The underlying mapping acts as a rotation by an angle  counterclockwise with axis
pointing in the direction of q.
Compared to Euler angles and matrices, the quaternion representation of
rotations has the advantage that given a rotation in quaternion notation it is easy to
ﬁnd the angle and axis of rotation.

Now let p be an arbitrary quaternion and q1, q2 be two unit quaternions. As the
next example shows, in the case when q1 and q2 are orthogonal, one can easily
identify the combined rotation .q1 ı q2/.p/ (about axes q1, q2 with respective
angles 1, 2).

Applications to Plane Geometry
Let q be a unit quaternion. Given a pure quaternion u we can actually decompose it
as u D a C n, where a is the component along q and n is the component normal to
q. We will show that under the mapping q, n is rotated about q through an angle .
Since the operator q is linear, the image quq can be indeed interpreted as the result
of rotating u about q through an angle . Since a is invariant under q, we focus on
how q acts on the orthogonal component n. Simple calculations give

Quaternion Sequences
In the present chapter we use the properties of quaternions described in a previous
chapter to explore the key notion of a quaternion sequence. Then we will use
this analogue in a formula called summation by parts, which is an analogue of
integration by parts for sums. Summation by parts is not only a useful auxiliary
tool, but even indispensable in many applications, including ﬁnding sums of powers
of integers and deriving some famous convergence tests for series: the Dirichlet and
Abel tests. Besides the new results that we will derive from it, much of the theory of
quaternion sequences is analogous to that encountered in real and complex calculus.
For this reason, the prerequisites are rather modest. A strong motivation for taking
up this study is that we need to understand the behavior of quaternion sequences in
order to construct formal quaternion power series and inﬁnite products in Chap. 4.
3.1
Quaternion Sequence
A quaternion sequence is a collection of real quaternions p1; p2; p3; : : : “labelled”
by nonnegative integers. We shall denote such a sequence by fpng1
nD1, where
n D 1; 2; 3; : : : and pn are the elements of the sequence. As an alternative simpler
notation from now on we write fpng for fpng1
nD1. Traditionally, one assumes that
a quaternion sequence has inﬁnitely many terms; a ﬁnite collection is sometimes
called a ﬁnite quaternion sequence. There is no requirement for the terms of a
quaternion sequence to be distinct, some of them may coincide. If all terms pn
coincide with the same quaternion number, the sequence is called constant. To give
an example, we take pn D nj nCkn so that the quaternion sequence fnj nCkng
is

Scalar and Vector Parts of a Quaternion Sequence
Let fpng WD fang Cfbngi Cfcngj Cfdngk be a quaternion sequence. The sequence
fang denotes the scalar part of fpng and fpng WD fbngi C fcngj C fdngk the vector
part of fpng. Here fang; fbng; fcng and fdng are real-valued sequences deﬁned on a
set of positive integers. The notations fang and fSc.pn/g (resp. fpng and fVec.pn/g)
are interchangeable.

Arithmetic Operations
As in the case with real and complex sequences, we have the standard operations on
quaternion sequences. In particular, given two quaternion sequences fpng and fqng,
we deﬁne:

We proceed to study the convergence and divergence of quaternion sequences.
Here we will recall some fundamental deﬁnitions and notations which will be
needed throughout the text, probably familiar to most readers in one form or other.
3.5
Convergence of a Quaternion Sequence
The notion of convergence of a sequence is the same as that of a limit. We say that
the sequence of quaternion numbers fpng converges to a limit p 2 H if jpnpj ! 0
as n ! 1. We will use the traditional notation: limn!1 pn D p, or pn ! p
as n ! 1. In other words, fpng converges to the real quaternion p if for each
positive quantity 
, no matter how small, a natural number N can be found such that
jpn  pj < 
 whenever n > N . This deﬁnition makes decisive use of the absolute
value. Since the notion of absolute value has a meaning for quaternions as well as
for real and complex numbers, we can use the same deﬁnition regardless of whether
the variable p and the functions studied are real, complex or quaternion.
3.6
Divergence of a Quaternion Sequence
The sequence fpng D fang C fbngi C fcngj C fdngk of real quaternions is called
divergent to inﬁnity if for every positive constant M1 (no matter how large), there
exists a natural number N D N.M1/ such that an; bn; cn; dn > M1 for every n > N .
For this one uses the notation: limn!1 pn D 1, or pn ! 1 as n ! 1. The
sequence fpng is called divergent to negative inﬁnity, and we write limn!1 pn D
1, or pn ! 1 as n ! 1, if for every constant M2 2 R, there exists N D
N.M2/ such that an; bn; cn; dn < M2 for every n > N . For example, the quaternion
sequence fn  n2i  n3j  nkg is divergent to negative inﬁnity.
The natural number N above certainly depends on the positive number 
. If 
1
is a positive number smaller than 
, then the corresponding N1 shall be larger than
N . Hence we will often write N to mean the dependence N.
/. It should also be
stressed that N is not unique. If a natural number N has the property needed in
the deﬁnition of convergence, then any larger natural number M will also have that
property. In practice, if we wish to attack a limit problem we will eventually have
to show that the quantity jpn  pj is less than 
 for some p 2 H when n  N . To
ﬁnd out which N to use is always the challenging part. Commonly, some algebraic
manipulations can be performed on the expression jpn pj that can help us ﬁnd out

3.6
Divergence of a Quaternion Sequence
57
exactly how to choose N . As we will see later, there are ways to tell in advance that
a quaternion sequence converges without knowing the value of the limit.
Let us list now some useful convergence properties. Let fpng and fqng be
quaternion sequences such that limn!1 pn D p and limn!1 qn D q, for p; q 2 H.
Then
(i)
lim
n!1 pn D p;
(ii)
lim
n!1 jpnj D jpj;
(iii)
lim
n!1.pn ˙ qn/ D p ˙ q;
(iv)
lim
n!1 pnqn D pq;
(v)
lim
n!1 p1
n
D p1 whenever p ¤ 0H and pn ¤ 0H for all n.
The veriﬁcation of these statements is not difﬁcult and is left to the reader. Properties
(iii) and (iv) can be extended to cope with any ﬁnite number of convergent
quaternion sequences. For example, for n sequences: limn!1.pn ˙ qn ˙    ˙
rn/ D limn!1 pn ˙ limn!1 qn ˙    ˙ limn!1 rn, and limn!1.pnqn    rn/ D
limn!1 pn limn!1 qn    limn!1 rn. Properties (iv) and (v) imply that
limn!1
pn
qn D pq1 whenever q ¤ 0H and qn ¤ 0H for all n. Furthermore, if p is
a quaternion number such that jpj < 1, then the quaternion sequence f.pn/ng has
limit 0H. If p ¤ 0H, then the sequence fjpnj1=ng has limit 1.

Criterion for Convergence
A quaternion sequence fpng converges to a quaternion number p D aCbiCcj Cdk
if and only if Sc.pn/ converges to p0 D a and Vec.pn/ converges to p D bi Ccj C

Sc.pn/ D

(c) if

lim
n!1 an D a;
lim
n!1 bn D b;
lim
n!1 cn D c;
and
lim
n!1 dn D d:
Solution. First, we prove the necessity part. Assume that pn converges to a limit
p, i.e. limn!1 pn D p. Hence, limn!1.pn  p/ D 0H. Let 
 > 0 be arbitrarily
chosen and ﬁxed. Then there exists a natural number N such that for every n > N
we have
p
.an  a/2 C .bn  b/2 C .cn  c/2 C .dn  d/2 < 
:
Since
jan  aj 
p
.an  a/2 C .bn  b/2 C .cn  c/2 C .dn  d/2 < 
;
and similarly jbn  bj; jcn  cj; jdn  dj < 
, we conclude that
lim
n!1 an D a;
lim
n!1 bn D b;
lim
n!1 cn D c;
lim
n!1 dn D d:
For the sufﬁciency part, assume that the previous relations hold. Then
lim
n!1
p
.an  a/2 C .bn  b/2 C .cn  c/2 C .dn  d/2 D 0;
i.e. limn!1 pn D p.
Next let us study the behavior of a quaternion sequence “after a certain point”,
and give it a precise meaning regardless of what went on before that. This may be
done by discarding the ﬁrst N terms of a given quaternion sequence fpng to get a
shifted sequence fqng given by qn D pNCn. We shall denote it by fpNCng, so that
fpNCng D fpNC1; pNC2; pNC3; pNC4; : : : g:
To complete the reasoning we introduce the deﬁnition below.
3.8
Certain ‘Property Eventually’
We say that a quaternion sequence fpng satisﬁes a ‘certain property eventually’, if
there is a natural number N such that the sequence fpNCng satisﬁes that property.
For instance, a quaternion sequence fpng is eventually bounded if there exists an N
such that the sequence fpNCng is bounded.
Exercise 3.89. Show that if a quaternion sequence is eventually bounded then it is
bounded.

the sequence fpng is eventually bounded.
We proceed with an example.
Example. Let N be a natural number and fpng a quaternion sequence. Prove that
limn!1 pn D p if and only if the shifted sequence limn!1 pNCn D p, p 2 H.
Solution. Let 
 > 0 be arbitrarily chosen and ﬁxed. Then there exists a natural
number N1 such that jpn  pj < 
 whenever n > N1. If n > N1, then N C n > N1,
therefore jpNCn  pj < 
. Hence, limn!1 pNCn D p. Conversely, suppose that
limn!1 pNCn D p. Then there exists a natural number N2 such that jpNCnpj < 
whenever n > N2. If n > N C N2, then n  N > N2, so
jpn  pj D jpNC.nN/  pj < 
:
Hence, limn!1 pn D p.
3.9
Quaternion Subsequence
A quaternion subsequence of fpng is a sequence of the form fpnig, where fnig is a
strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers.
Exercise 3.91. Prove that any subsequence of a convergent quaternion sequence is
convergent (to the same limit).
Exercise 3.92. Prove that every subsequence of a bounded quaternion sequence is
bounded.
Exercise 3.93. If the shifted subsequence fpNCng is bounded, does it follow that
the sequence fpng is bounded? Justify your answer.
3.10
Expression ‘of the Order of’
If fpng and fqng are two quaternion sequences such that a natural number N can be
found such that j.pn=qn/j < K whenever n > N , where K is independent of n, we
say that fpng is ‘of the order of’ fqng, and write pn D O.qn/. For example,
 n C 2j  nk

Exercise 3.96. Let fpng, fqng and frng be quaternion sequences. If fpng and fqng
are equivalent, prove that limn!1.pnrn/ D limn!1.qnrn/.
Despite its many advantages, the deﬁnition of convergence of a quaternion
sequence has one disadvantage, namely that we need to know the limit in order
to prove that the sequence converges. There is a method that permits to prove
the existence of a limit even when it cannot be determined explicitly. This test of
convergence bears the name of the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy
(1789–1857), and it will be brieﬂy discussed below.
3.12
Cauchy Quaternion Sequence
A quaternion sequence fpng is said to be a Cauchy quaternion sequence, or
fundamental (or to have the Cauchy property) if, for each positive 
, no matter how
small, an integer N > 0 can be found such that jpn  pmj < 
 for all n; m > N .
“For all m, n that satisfy n; m > N ” is essential: for instance, a quaternion sequence
fpng satisfying jpnC1  pnj < 
 for all n > N may not be a Cauchy quaternion
sequence.
Example. Consider the quaternion sequence fpng D

 , the result will follow.
Exercise 3.97. Let fpng and fqng be Cauchy quaternion sequences. Prove that
fpn qng is a Cauchy quaternion sequence.
Exercise 3.98. Let pn D an C ibn C jcn C kdn, where an, bn, cn, dn 2 R. Prove
that fpng is a Cauchy quaternion sequence if and only if fang, fbng, fcng, fdng are
Cauchy sequences.
3.13
Cauchy Convergence Test
A quaternion sequence fpng is convergent if and only if it is a Cauchy quaternion
sequence. That this condition is necessary is trivial: If limn!1 pn D p, we can ﬁnd
N such that jpn  pj < 
2. For n; m > N , it follows that
jpn  pmj  jpn  pj C jpm  pj < 
:
There are several ways to prove that the condition is also sufﬁcient. Here we
make use of the well-known Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, attributed to the Czech
mathematician and philosopher Bernard Bolzano (1781–1848) and the German
mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897). Suppose that fpng D fang C fbngi C
fcngj C fdngk is a Cauchy quaternion sequence. Using the result of the previous
exercise, the four real-valued sequences fang; fbng; fcng, and fdng have the Cauchy
property, and moreover they are bounded. In particular, for 
 D 1 a natural number
N can be found such that n  m  N implies that jan  amj < 1, and so
janj  jan  aN j C jaN j < 1 C jaN j. Hence the real sequence fang is bounded by
maxfja1j; : : : ; jaN1j; 1 C jaN jg. By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, fang must
contain a convergent subsequence, say fani g. Thus, for some a 2 R we have
limi!1 ani D a. Let 
 > 0 be arbitrarily chosen and ﬁxed. Then there exists a
natural number I so that i  I implies jani  aj < 
2. There is also an integer M
such that n; m  M we have jan  amj < 
2. We may also, if necessary, increase
I until nI  M . Then n  nI implies jan  aj  jan  anI j C janI  aj < 
.
Therefore fang converges to a. Similarly we can prove that the sequences fbng, fcng
and fdng converge, respectively, to b; c; d 2 R. Consequently, fpng converges to
p D a C bi C cj C dk.
Exercise 3.99. Let fpng be a convergent sequence, and fqng a Cauchy quaternion
sequence. Prove that the quaternion sequence fpnqng has the Cauchy property.
Exercise 3.100. Let fpng and fqng be Cauchy quaternion sequences, and a; b 2 H.
Prove that: (a) fapn C bqng is a Cauchy sequence;
(b) fpng
fqng is a Cauchy sequence
whenever qn ¤ 0H for all n.

3.15
Abel Transformation
63
Let us move on to the discussion of a formula called “summation by parts”,
which is often used to simplify the computation or (especially) estimation of certain
types of sums. The summation by parts formula is often called Abel transformation,
named after Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829).
3.14
Summation by Parts

Quaternion Series and Inﬁnite Products
An essential feature of the classical theory of power series is that we can manipulate
recurrence relations for power series without necessarily worrying about whether
the underlying series converge. In case they do converge, we can extract important
information about the recurrence relation that may not otherwise be easily obtain-
able.
In this chapter we use the properties of quaternion sequences described in
the previous chapter to explore the key notions of convergence and divergence
for quaternion inﬁnite series and products. In practice it is truly laborious and
frequently difﬁcult to prove that a particular quaternion series converges uniformly
in a given region. Here we preferably end up dealing (implicitly or explicitly)
with general results that provide some tests under which quaternion series will
converge uniformly. As we will see, many interesting and useful quaternion series
and products are simply generalizations of their counterparts from real and complex
calculus. The reader is urged to pay particular attention to what is said about
geometric series, since this type of series will be important in the later chapters.
We now introduce the notion of a quaternion series in a manner similar to that
encountered in real and complex calculus.
4.1
Quaternion Series
Let fpng be a sequence of real quaternions, and let the sum p1 C p2 C    C pn
be denoted by Sn. The sequence fSng is also called the series associated to the
sequence fpng.
We introduce the following deﬁnitions:
(i) If Sn tends to a limit S as n ! 1, the quaternion inﬁnite series P1
nD1 pn is
said to be convergent,or to convergeto the sum S, and we write P1
nD1 pn D S;
(ii) P1
nD1 pn is said to diverge if fSng does not converge as n ! 1;
(iii) P1
nD1 pn is said to diverge to inﬁnity if fSng tends to inﬁnity as n ! 1;
(iv) P1
nD1 pn is said to diverges to negative inﬁnity if fSng tends to negative inﬁnity
as n ! 1.

Quaternion Series and Inﬁnite Products
When the underlying quaternion series converges, the expression S  Sn, which
is the sum of the series
pnC1 C pnC2 C pnC3 C    ;
is called the remainder after n terms, and is frequently denoted by the symbol Rn.
In addition, the sum pnC1 C pnC2 C pnC3 C    C pnCm will be denoted by Sn;m.
We can easily derive some properties for quaternion series:
4.2
Arithmetic Properties of Quaternion Series
Let P1
nD1 pn and P1
nD1 qn be two quaternion series, and ;  quaternion numbers.
The following statements are true:
(i) If P1
nD1 pn and P1
nD1 qn are both convergent, then the series P1
nD1.pn ˙
qn/ are convergent and their sum (difference) is P1
nD1.pn ˙ qn/ D
 P1
nD1 pn ˙  P1
nD1 qn;
(ii) If P1
nD1 pn is convergentand P1
nD1 qn is divergent, then the series P1
nD1.pn˙
qn/ are divergent;
(iii) If N is a natural number, then the quaternion series P1
nD1 pn converges if and
only if the shifted series P1
nD1 pNCn converges.
Exercise 4.104. Let fpng D f1 C ni C j C kg and fqng D f 1
n2 i C jg. Investigate
the convergence or divergence of the series P1

Solution. Both divergent.
4.3
Geometric Quaternion Series
Due to the noncommutativity of the multiplication we shall distinguish between a
left and right geometric quaternion series. A left geometric quaternion series is any
series of the form
1
X
nD1
apn1 D a C ap C ap2 C ap3 C    ;
(4.1)
where a 2 H. Similarly, we deﬁne a right geometric quaternion series as

pn1a D a C pa C p2a C p3a C    :
Throughout the text we only use left geometric quaternion series that, for simplicity,
we call geometric quaternion series. Nevertheless, all results obtained for left

4.3
Geometric Quaternion Series
71
geometric quaternion series can easily be adapted to right geometric quaternion
series. For (4.1), the nth term of the sequence of partial sums is
Sn D a C ap C ap2 C    C apn1:
In order to ﬁnd a formula for Sn, we multiply the right-hand side of Sn by p,
Snp D ap C ap2 C ap3 C    C apn;
and subtract this result from Sn. Then all terms cancel, except for the ﬁrst term in
Sn and the last term in Snp. So, more concretely,
Sn  Snp D a C ap C ap2 C    C apn1 

ap C ap2 C    C apn1 C apn
D a  apn;
or Sn.1H  p/ D a.1H  pn/. Solving the last equation for Sn one obtains
Sn D a.1H  pn/.1H  p/1:
(4.2)
Since pn ! 0H as n ! 1 whenever jpj < 1, we have that Sn ! a.1H  p/1.
In other words, for jpj < 1 the sum of a geometric series (4.1) is
a.1H  p/1 D a C ap C ap2 C ap3 C    :
(4.3)
The geometric series (4.1) diverges when jpj  1. Let us give an example. Consider
the quaternion geometric series

Quaternion Series and Inﬁnite Products
Setting a D 1H, the equality in (4.3) becomes
.1H  p/1 D 1H C p C p2 C p3 C    :
(4.4)
Replacing the symbol p by p in the previous equality, we get a similar result:
.1H C p/1 D 1H  p C p2  p3 C    :
Analogous to (4.3), the last equality is also valid for jpj < 1 since j  pj D jpj.
Now let a D 1H. That is to say, (4.2) gives us the sum of the ﬁrst n terms of the
quaternion series in (4.4):
.1H  pn/.1H  p/1 D 1H C p C p2 C p3 C    C pn1:
Ultimately, we obtain the alternative form
.1H  p/1 D 1H C p C p2 C p3 C    C pn1 C pn.1H  p/1:
Exercise 4.106. Let p D 1

We proceed by discussing important results about convergence and divergence of
inﬁnite quaternion series. We advice the reader that, while studying the convergence
or divergence of a given quaternion series, he should also state by which test you
are drawing your conclusions.
4.4
A Necessary Condition for Convergence
If the series P1
nD1 pn converges, then limn!1 pn D 0H. Indeed, let S denote the
sum of the series. Then Sn ! S and Sn1 ! S as n tends to inﬁnity. By taking the
limit of both sides of Sn  Sn1 D pn as n ! 1 we obtain the desired conclusion.
Example. The condition above is necessary, but not sufﬁcient: it is possible that
limn!1 pn D 0H, but P1
nD1 pn diverges. Take for example
fpng D
 1
n C 1
ni C 1
nj C 1
nk

:
It is easily seen that limn!1 pn D 0H, but P1
nD1 pn is divergent.

Absolute and Conditional Convergence of a Quaternion Series

4.5
The nth Term Test for Divergence
If limn!1 pn ¤ 0H or if the limit does not exist, then P1
nD1 pn diverges. For
example, the quaternion series
1
X
nD1
n2 C i C n2j  nk
n2
diverges since, obviously,
lim
n!1
n2 C i C n2j  nk
n2
D 1 C j ¤ 0H:
Nevertheless, the term test cannot prove by itself that a quaternion series converges.
We saw above that even if limn!1 pn D 0H the series P1
nD1 pn may or may not
converge. In other words, if limn!1 pn D 0H, the test is inconclusive; the reader
must use another test to determine the convergence or divergence of the series.
Exercise 4.107. Let fpng D f 1

4.6
Absolute and Conditional Convergence of a Quaternion
Series
An inﬁnite quaternion series P1
nD1 pn is said to be absolutely convergent if the
series P1
nD1 jpnj converges. An inﬁnite series P1
nD1 pn is said to be conditionally
convergent if it converges, but P1
nD1 jpnj diverges. We further assume the reader to
be familiar with the fact if jpnj  Cjqnj for all n (C is some number independent
of n), then
(i) If P1
nD1 jqnj converges, then P1
nD1 jpnj converges;
(ii) If P1
nD1 jpnj diverges, then P1
nD1 jqnj diverges.
Example. Consider the quaternion series P1

Exercise 4.110. Let fpng D f.1/n 1
ng. Does P1
nD1 pn converge absolutely, con-
verge conditionally, or diverge? Justify your answer.
Solution. It converges conditionally.
Next we introduce two of the most frequently used tests for convergence of
inﬁnite quaternion series.
4.7
Root Test
Suppose P1
nD1 pn is a quaternion series such that
lim
n!1 sup
np
jpnj D L1:
(4.5)
(i) If L1 < 1, the series converges absolutely;
(ii) If L1 > 1 or L1 D 1, the series diverges;
(iii) If L1 D 1, the test is inconclusive.
For simplicity we shall prove Statements (i) and (ii) only. The veriﬁcation of
Statement (iii) is left to the reader. To prove (i) we take a real number l1 such that
L1 < l1 < 1. Then a natural number N can be found such that
np
jpnj < l1 for
n  N . Having chosen such a l1, the terms of the series P1
nD1 jpnj are bounded
from above by the terms of the real geometric series P1
nD1 ln
1 , and this means that
our series converges absolutely. If we have in (ii) L1 > 1, then we have inﬁnitely
many indices n such that
np
jpnj > 1 (resp. jpnj > 1), implying the divergence of
the series.
Example. Let fpng D fen C e2ni C e3nj C e4nkg. Study the convergence of
the series P1
nD1 pn using the root test.
Solution. A direct computation shows that
lim
n!1 sup
np
jpnj < 2e2 < 1:
Hence, P1
nD1 pn converges absolutely.

4.8
Ratio Test
75
Exercise 4.111. Using the root test, determine whether the quaternion series
P1
nD1
.3C11ij Ck/n
nŠ
is convergent or divergent.
Solution. Divergent.
4.8
Ratio Test
Suppose P1
nD1 pn is a series of nonzero quaternion terms such that
lim supn!1
jpnC1j
jpnj
D L2:
(4.6)
(i) For the L1 from the root test we have L1  L2, and if L2 < 1 the series
converges absolutely;
(ii) If L2 > 1 or L2 D 1, the series diverges;
(iii) If L2 D 1, the test is inconclusive.
We notice that instead of writing jpnC1j
jpnj
we may also take the quotient
ˇˇˇ
pnC1
pn
ˇˇˇ. It is
assumed above that the terms are different from zero. Take L2 < 1, and then choose
L2 < l2 < 1. For n  N with a suitable N we have that
jpnj  l2jpn1j  l2
2jpn2j      lnN
2
jpNj
and, moreover, jpnj  ln
2 jpN j
lN
2
, whence
np
jpnj  l2 nq
jpN j
lN
2 .
From the last inequality it follows that L1  L2, and from the ﬁrst we see that,
up to a factor, our series is bounded above by P1
nD1 ln
2 . And, by an argument such
as was just used above, we have convergence of the series. For the second part of
the proof take L2 > l2 > 1. Then jpnC1j  l2jpnj  jpnj for all sufﬁciently large n.
Hence the absolute values of the generic terms of our series do not converge to zero
and the series diverges.
Example. Let fpng D f.1 C i C 3j C k/ng. Study the convergence of the series
P1
nD1 pn using the ratio test.
Solution. A direct computation shows that
lim
n!1 sup jpnC1j
jpnj
D sup j1 C i C 3j C kj D 2
p
3 > 1:
Therefore the series P1
nD1 pn is divergent.
Exercise 4.112. Using the ratio test, determine whether the quaternion series
P1
nD1

n3n
is convergent or divergent.
Solution. Divergent.

4.9
Quaternion Sequences of Bounded Variation
A quaternion sequence fpng is said to be of bounded variation if P1
nD1 jpnC1 
pnj < 1. An important property is that any quaternion sequence of bounded
variation converges. Indeed, assume that fpng is of bounded variation. Given m < n,
it sufﬁces to observe that pn  pm can be written as Pn
kDm.pkC1  pk/. It follows
that jpn  pmj  Pn
kDm jpkC1  pkj. By assumption, the sum P1
kD1 jpkC1  pkj
converges, so the sum on the right-hand side of this inequality can be made
arbitrarily small as m; n ! 1. In conclusion, fpng has the Cauchy property and
hence converges.

nD1 pn may
not converge). Then for any quaternion sequence fqng of bounded variation that
converges to zero, the series P1
nD1 pnqn converges. To show this, deﬁne p0 D 0H
(so that S0 D 0H) and q0 D 0H. Setting m D 0 in the Abel transformation (3.2), we
can write

(4.7)
We have two assumptions: the ﬁrst is that the partial sums fSng are bounded, say by
a constant C, and the second is that the sequence fqng is of bounded variation and
converges to zero. Since fSng is bounded and qn ! 0H as n ! 1, it follows that
Snqn ! 0H as n ! 1. Since jSnj  C for all n and fqng is of bounded variation,
the series P1
kD1 Sk.qkC1  qk/ is absolutely convergent. Indeed,

Finally, taking n ! 1 in (4.7) it follows that the series P1

The power series (4.9) and (4.10) are said to be centered at q; the quaternion point q
is referred to as the center of the series. It is also convenient to deﬁne .p q/0 D 1H
even when p D q. From now on we only deal with the series (4.9), which for
simplicity we call quaternion power series.

4.14
Radius of Convergence
There exists a number R, 0  R  C1, called the radius of convergence of the
series (4.9), such that the series converges for all values of p such that jp  qj < R
and diverges for all p such that jp  qj > R. On the boundary, that is, where
jp  qj D R, the situation is more delicate, as one may have either convergence
or divergence (see the example below). In particular, the power series converges
uniformly in every smaller ball fjp  qj  R  
 W 
 > 0g. We notice, for future
reference, that the number R may be expressed in terms of the quaternion sequence
fang of coefﬁcients of the series as
1
R WD lim
n!1 sup janj1=n;
with the identiﬁcations 1
0 WD 1 and
1
1 WD 0. This is known as the Cauchy-
Hadamard formula for the radius of convergence. The radius of convergence
can be:
(i) R D 0 (in which case (4.9) converges only at its center p D q), or
(ii) R is a ﬁnite positive number (in which case (4.9) converges at all interior points
of the ball jp  qj < R), or
(iii) R D 1 (in which case (4.9) converges for all p).
For simplicity, we assume that the series is centered at q D 0H. Let R be given
as above, and assume ﬁrstly 0 < R < 1. From the deﬁnition of R it follows that
for all 
 > 0 there exists an integer N.
/ > 0, such that janj1=n.R  
/ < 1 for all
n > N.
/. Hence, for these n’s one has that janpnj 


. The right-hand side
is the form of a convergent series for jpj  R 2
, and by comparison we conclude
the uniform convergence of the power series for jpj  R  2
. Since 
 > 0 was
chosen arbitrarily, we have convergence for jpj < R. To prove the divergence for

Therefore, we ﬁnd janjjpjn 

jpj
RC
n
. As we can ﬁnd for every jpj > R an 
 such
that jpj > R C 
, the power series diverges for all p with jpj > R. In particular,
in case R D 0 we conclude as before that the series diverges for all jpj ¤ 0. And
ﬁnally for R D 1 we have limn!1 janj1=n D 0; it follows that for all

a comparison series that converges for all jpj with sufﬁciently small

Thus the series converges absolutely for jp  i C kj < 4. The ball of convergence
is jp  i C kj < 4, and the radius of convergence is R D 4. We highlight the fact
that, at p  i C k D 4, the series

4.16
The Arithmetic of Quaternion Power Series
We now deﬁne certain arithmetic operations on one or more quaternion power
series:
(i) A quaternion power series P1
nD0 an.p  q/n can be multiplied by a nonzero
quaternion constant  without affecting its convergence or divergence;
(ii) A quaternion power series P1
nD0 an.p  q/n converges absolutely within its
ball of convergence. As a consequence, within the ball of convergence the
terms of the series can be rearranged and the rearranged series has the same
sum S as the original series;
(iii) Two quaternion power series P1
nD0 an.p  q/n and P1
nD0 bn.p  q/n can be
added and subtracted by adding or subtracting like terms, namely:
1
X
nD0
an.p  q/n ˙
1
X
nD0
bn.p  q/n D
1
X
nD0
.an ˙ bn/.p  q/n:
If both series have the same nonzero radius of convergence R, the radius of
convergence of P1
nD0.an ˙ bn/.p  q/n is R. If one series has radius of
convergence R1 > 0 and the another one has radius of convergence R2 > 0,
where R1 ¤ R2, then the radius of convergence of P1
nD0.an ˙ bn/.p  q/n is
the smaller of the two numbers R1 and R2.
Exercise 4.123. Let an be a quaternion sequence such that janj  2n for all n.
What can you say about the radius of convergence of P1

Next we consider inﬁnite products of sequences of quaternion numbers.

Inﬁnite Products of Quaternion Numbers
If fpg is a sequence of quaternion numbers, the sequence
(
n
Y
Dk
p
)
R
D pkpkC1    pn
of products is called a(n) (inﬁnite) quaternion right product with the factors p. In
an analogous way, the sequence
(
n
Y
Dk
p
)
L
D pnpn1    pk
of products is called a(n) (inﬁnite) quaternion left product with the factors p. For
the reader’s convenience, from now on we only deal with the above quaternion right
product, which for simplicity we call quaternion product. It will be simply denoted
by
˚Qn
Dk p

. We write Q1
Dk p; usually, k D 0 or k D 1. By analogy with
the series, the product is said to converge when the limit of the sequence of partial
products exists (as a ﬁnite limit in H) and is nonzero. Otherwise the product is said
to diverge.
4.18
Absolute and Conditional Convergence of a Quaternion
Product
We say that Q1
Dk p converges absolutely if Q1
Dk jpj converges. If Q1
Dk p
converges absolutely, then Q1
Dk p converges, but the converse is false. If Q1
Dk p
converges but Q1
Dk jpj does not, then we say that Q1
Dk p converges condition-
ally.
Example. Investigate the convergence of the quaternion product Q1

Exponents and Logarithms
The real exponential and logarithmic functions play an important role in advanced
mathematics, including applications to calculus, differential equations, and complex
analysis. In this chapter we use the properties of quaternions described in the
previous chapters to deﬁne and study the quaternionic analogues of these functions.
It turns out that exponential and logarithmic quaternion functions can be deﬁned
because quaternions form a division algebra. To make sense of this, it will be
convenient to deﬁne some of their more common properties, which as in the real
and complex cases, should be familiar to the reader.
New aspects come into view when we consider quaternion-valued functions
depending on a quaternion variable, that is, when we study functions whose domain
and range are subsets of the four-dimensional quaternion space. As a ﬁrst example
we introduce the quaternion exponential function ep for a given real quaternion p,
which has many similarities with the real and complex exponential functions.
We then proceed by introducing the quaternion logarithm ln.q/, which will be used
to solve exponential equations of the form ep D q for a quaternion q. It will be
shown that when q is a ﬁxed nonzero quaternion number there are inﬁnitely many
solutions to the equation ep D q. The principal value of the quaternion logarithm
will be deﬁned to be a single-valued quaternion function whose argument lies in
the interval Œ0; . This principal value quaternion function will be shown to be
an inverse function of the quaternion exponential function deﬁned on a suitably
restricted domain of the quaternion space. We will illustrate this point with the aid
of some examples and exercises, since our experience has shown that this approach
is useful for someone who is introduced to the subject for the ﬁrst time. Further
examples may be found in the exercises at the end of the chapter.
At this stage it is convenient to deﬁne some of the more common functions of a
quaternion variable. This, as in the real and complex cases, will be familiar to the
reader.

Quaternion Natural Exponential Function
The function ep deﬁned by
ep WD ep0
cos jpj C sgn.p/ sin jpj

(5.1)
is called the quaternion natural exponential function, and is deﬁned to be merely
a notational convenience given its similarity with the de Moivre’s formula.1 The
number “e” is a mathematical constant, the base of the natural logarithm, and is
known as the Euler number.2 When p is a real or complex number, the deﬁnition
of ep does naturally yields the usual exponential function of real and complex
numbers. The previous representation is explained in the following calculation. For
this purpose it will be necessary to deﬁne ep WD P1
lD0
pl
lŠ . The reader should notice
that this series converges for all p, in analogy to the complex case, since we have
jplj  jpjl for any quaternion p. Since ejpj converges, the comparison test yields
that ep converges for all p. Clearly, the series expansions

From the practical point of view, the quaternion exponential function is an example
of one that is deﬁned by specifying its scalar and vectors parts. More precisely,
the scalar and vector parts of ep are, respectively, Sc.ep/ D ep0 cos jpj and
Vec.ep/ D ep0sgn.p/ sin jpj. Thus, the values of this quaternion function are found
by expressing the point p as p D t Cxi Cyj Czk, and then substituting the values
of t, x, y and z in the given expression. We record now some useful properties of
the quaternion exponential function.

Modulus, Argument, and Conjugate of the Quaternion
Exponential Function
The modulus, argument, and conjugate of the quaternion exponential function are
easily determined from (5.1). To do this, we start by expressing the quaternion w D
ep in polar form, with a quaternion modulus and an argument: w D jwj


. Now one can easily see that jwj D ep0 and  D jpj C 2n, for n D

and arg.ep/ D jpj C 2n, n D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : :. For the conjugate of the quaternion
function ep a formula is found using properties of the real cosine and sine functions:

(b) For all p 2 H with jpj  1, we have
jep  1Hj  2jpj.
In the following we introduce the quaternion natural logarithm function ln.p/,
which is motivated by the need to deﬁne the “inverse” of the quaternion natural
exponential function ep. More precisely, we deﬁne ln.p/ to be any quaternion
number such that eln.p/ D p and ln.ep/ D p. This is too much to hope for. We shall
discuss this matter in further detail in the remainder of the section.
5.3
Quaternion Natural Logarithm Function
The quaternion natural logarithm function ln.p/ is given by
ln.p/ WD loge jpj C sgn.p/ arg.p/:
(5.2)
Here loge jpj is the usual real natural logarithm of the positive number jpj (and
hence is deﬁned unambiguously). This quaternion function is another example
of one that is deﬁned by specifying its scalar and vectors parts. More precisely,
the scalar and vector parts of ln.p/ are, respectively, Sc.ln.p//
D
loge jpj
and Vec.ln.p// D sgn.p/ arg.p/. Because there are intrinsically inﬁnitely many
arguments of p, it is clear that representation (5.2) gives inﬁnitely many solutions w
to the equation ew D p whenever p is a nonzero quaternion number. By switching to
polar form in (5.2), we obtain the following alternative description of the quaternion
logarithm:

determines what is known as a branch (or sheet), a single-valued component of the

multiple-valued logarithmic quaternion function. When n D 0, we have a special
situation.
Example. Find all quaternion solutions p to the equation ep D i.
Solution. For each equation ep D q, the set of solutions is given by p D ln.q/.
Setting q D i we deduce that jqj D 1 and arg.q/ D 

Thus, from representation (5.2) we establish:

Principal Value of a Quaternion Natural Logarithm
Function
If we wish to work with single-valued branches of ln.p/, it is more satisfactory
to restrict arg.p/ to its principal value Arg.p/. This yields the principal branch or
principal value of the quaternion logarithm,3 denoted by the symbol Ln.p/, and
deﬁned as
Ln.p/ WD loge jpj C sgn.p/ Arg.p/:
3The branch corresponding to n D 0 is known as the principal branch, therefore the values that the
function takes along this branch are known as principal values.

5.5
Principal Value of a Quaternion Natural Logarithm Function

It is therefore perfectly legitimate to write the principal value of the quaternion

p such that  2 Œ0; .
The principal value of the quaternion logarithm function retains the following
properties:

The Inverse of the Quaternion Natural Logarithm Function
At this stage we return to the principle mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Since Ln.p/ is one of the values of the quaternion logarithm ln.p/, (5.2) indicates
that eLn.p/ D p, and Ln.ep/ D p for all nonzero quaternions p in the so-called
fundamental region: 0 < p0 < C1 and jpj < . This suggests that the quaternion
function Ln.p/ plays the role of an inverse function for the exponential quaternion
function ep. To justify this claim, observe that jepj D ep0 and arg.ep/ D jpj C
2n, for n D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : :. Since p is in the fundamental region, it is clear that

If z WD x C iy is a complex variable then one express z˛ with ˛ a complex
number, for example, as e˛ ln.z/. Let us see whether a corresponding statement using
the exponential and logarithm quaternion functions holds true.

Quaternion Power Function
If q is a real quaternion and p ¤ 0H, then the quaternion power function pq is
deﬁned to be:
pq WD eln.p/q:
(5.3)
This deﬁnition certainly holds for q D 0H, so only the case of nonvanishing q has
to be considered. The multiple-valuedness of arg.p/ implies that pq may assume an
inﬁnite number of values. Depending on q the quaternion power function will have
either one, ﬁnitely many, or inﬁnitely many values: if q D n is an integer, then pn
assumes one value only. If q D a
b is a rational number, where a and b are coprime,
then p
a
b D jpj
a
b esgn.p/arg.p/ a
b has a ﬁnite number of values. If q is a nonzero real
quaternion, then pq always has an inﬁnite number of values.
Quaternion powers satisfy the following properties:
(i) .pq/n D pnq for n D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : :;
(ii) pq1pq2 ¤ pq1Cq2 in general, unless ln.p/q1 and ln.p/q2 commute.

Principal Value of a Quaternion Power Function
We can assign a unique value to pq by using the principal value of the quaternion
logarithm Ln.p/ instead of ln.p/. This particular value is called the principal value
of the quaternion power function pq, and is deﬁned by

Trigonometric Functions
In this chapter we deﬁne quaternion trigonometric functions. Analogously to the
quaternion functions ep and ln.p/, these functions will agree with their counterparts
for real and complex input. In addition, we will show that the quaternion trigonomet-
ric functions satisfy many of the same identities the real and complex trigonometric
functions do. We further note that some identities will be used in the calculus of
these quaternion functions without previous introduction. Even though our aim is to
smooth the path for the reader who wishes to gain an understanding of these results
in quaternion trigonometry, we still include complete proofs of such identities in
this introductory exposition.
With the help of the exponential function (5.1), quaternionic analogues of the
trigonometric functions can be introduced.

are called the quaternion sine and cosine functions. It is clear that the quaternion
trigonometric functions are natural generalizations of the conventional ones we are
familiar with in the real and complex settings. Of course another way of deﬁning
the sine and cosine quaternion functions would be via their power series. This leads
to the alternative deﬁnitions,

Trigonometric Identities
The usual identities, such as sin.p/ D  sin.p/ and cos.p/ D cos.p/, hold here
as well. This follows from the previous deﬁnitions and properties of the quaternion
exponential function. We may then ask whether or not other familiar identities
for real and complex trigonometric functions hold in a quaternionic context. A
straightforward computation shows that for sin2.p/ C cos2.p/ D 1H the answer
is yes. To get a handle on the proof, we ﬁrst derive the relations
p sgn.p/ D p0 sgn.p/ C p sgn.p/
D jpj C p0 sgn.p/
and
sgn .p0 sgn.p// D p0 sgn.p/

We can go one step further and deduce the identities
ep sgn.p/ D ejpjep0 sgn.p/

from which it follows that
sin.p/ D sin.p0/ cos.p/ C cos.p0/ sin.p/;
cos.p/ D cos.p0/ cos.p/  sin.p0/ sin.p/:
The rest of the proof can be done without too much difﬁculty by computation and is
left as an exercise for the reader. Let us now give up an example. Take p D i C j;

cos p sin q and cos.p˙q/ D cos p cos qsin p sin q, since sgn .p C q/ is not linear

6.3
Trigonometric Equations
Keeping the previous notions, we now turn our attention to quaternion trigonometric
equations. It is clear that always there are either no solutions, ﬁnitely many, or
inﬁnitely many solutions to equations of the form sin.p/ D w or cos.p/ D w,
for a given quaternion w; this has to do with the possible many-valuedness of these
functions. There are several methods to reduce a given equation to an equivalent, but
more manageable expression, however we shall focus almost exclusively on using
previous deﬁnitions together with algebraic techniques. For example, let p D bi be
a solution to the equation sin.p/ D i. The discussion of this example presents no
particular difﬁculty. A straightforward computation shows that b sinh.jbj/ D jbj,
and when solved this equation gives p D ˙ ln.1 C
p
2/i. Each of these values of p
satisﬁes the equation sin.p/ D i.
Example. Let p D a C bi C cj C dk. Solve the equation cos.p/ D 1H.
Solution. We ﬁrst compute cos.p/ explicitly. We have

Zeros
A standard result in real analysis says that the zeros (roots) of the real sine function
are the integer multiples of , and that the zeros of the real cosine function are
the odd integer multiples of 
2 . Analogous statements hold for the complex sine
and cosine functions. It is clearly of interest to check whether similar conclusions
hold in a quaternionic context. One way of answering these questions is by solving
the equations sin.p/ D 0H and cos.p/ D 0H in the manner presented above. A
different method involves recalling that a quaternion is equal to 0H if and only if its
modulus is 0. This is a simple matter once the reader observes that sin.p/ D 0H and

112

Trigonometric Functions
cos.p/ D 0H are equivalent to solving the equations j sin.p/j D 0 and j cos.p/j D
0, respectively.
To make things understandable, we again rely on the expressions
sin.p/ D sin.p0/ cos.p/ C cos.p0/ sin.p/;
cos.p/ D cos.p0/ cos.p/  sin.p0/ sin.p/:
Taking into account that sgn.p/ D sgn.p/, one has
j sin.p/j2 D sin2.p0/ C sinh2 jpj;
j cos.p/j2 D cos2.p0/ C cosh2 jpj  1:
Since sin2.p0/ (resp. cos2.p0/ ) and sinh2 jpj are both nonnegative real numbers, it
is evident that the above equations are satisﬁed if and only if sin.p0/ D 0 (resp.
cos.p0/ D 0) and sinh jpj D 0. As just noticed, sin.p0/ D 0 when p0 D n, n D

, n D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : :), and
sinh jpj D 0 only when jpj D 0. Therefore the quaternion trigonometric functions
have only the zeros known for the real functions, i.e.,

Since the quaternion sine and cosine agree with the real and complex sine and

Hyperbolic Functions
After bringing together various results mentioned before, in this chapter we
introduce the quaternion hyperbolic functions, whose study will require us to master
a new situation. Since the quaternion exponential function agrees with the real and
complex exponential function of real and complex arguments, it follows that the
quaternion hyperbolic functions also agree with their usual counterparts for real and
complex input. This allows us to discuss some important hyperbolic identities and
the existence of inﬁnitely many zeros of the quaternion sine and cosine hyperbolic
functions, and to solve equations involving hyperbolic functions. A remarkable
result of the theory exhibits the deep connection between the hyperbolic and
trigonometric functions discussed in the previous chapter. We hope that material
presented in this part will make this beautiful topic accessible to the reader.
The quaternion hyperbolic sine and cosine functions may be deﬁned using the
quaternion exponential function as follows:

respectively, are called the quaternion sine and cosine hyperbolic functions. These
expressions make it clear that the quaternion hyperbolic functions are gener-
alizations of the real and complex hyperbolic functions to quaternion values.
Alternatively, the reader is doubtless familiar with the idea of introducing power
series as another way of deﬁning the quaternion sine and cosine hyperbolic functions
and with the fact that both approaches yield the same quaternion function. The
quaternion sine and cosine hyperbolic functions can be expressed via their Taylor
series as follows:

cosh.0H/ D 1H. In this sense our discussion can serve as a brief review of
previously understood notions. A natural question may have occurred to some
readers by now: Do familiar identities for real and complex hyperbolic functions
still hold in the quaternionic context? A straightforward computation shows that for
cosh2.p/  sinh2.p/ D 1H the answer is positive. The proof is left as an exercise.

Equations with Hyperbolic Functions
The above considerations enable us to gain insight into equations involving the
aforementioned hyperbolic functions. For the convenience of the reader, we note
here that for a given quaternion w equations of the form sinh.p/ D w or cosh.p/ D
w always either have no solutions, or have ﬁnitely many or inﬁnitely many solutions;
this has to do with the possible many-valuedness of these functions. To exemplify
this, let p D cj be a solution to the equation cosh.p/ D 1H. A direct computation
shows that cos.jcj/ D 1, and we see from this that p D ˙2n j, n 2 Z. We can
verify that each of these values of p satisﬁes the equation cosh.p/ D 1H.
Example. Let p D a C bi C cj C dk, where a; b; c; d 2 H. Solve the equation

Relation to Quaternion Sine and Cosine Functions
We are now in a position to gather and set some light on the diverse notions
concerning the quaternion trigonometric and hyperbolic functions from a unifying
point of view. The motivation for this exposition comes in part from the simple and
direct relation between these functions. Our intention is to familiarize the reader
with these relations. By deﬁnition,
e˙p D cos jpj ˙ sgn.p/ sin jpj;
so we see that quaternion trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are simply related:
cosh.p/ D cos jpj;
and in a similar manner
sinh.p/ D sgn.p/ sin jpj:
Using the sum and difference formulae, a straightforward calculation exhibits a
noteworthy connection between the trigonometric and the hyperbolic functions,
namely,
sinh.p/ D sinh.p0/ cos jpj C cosh.p0/ sinh.p/;
cosh.p/ D cosh.p0/ cos jpj C sinh.p0/ sinh.p/:
Exercise 7.187. Prove the following identities: (a) cosh.p/ D cos .sgn.p p//;
(b) sinh.p/ D sgn.p/ sin .sgn.p p//;
(c) cosh.p/ D cos jpj;
(d) sinh.p/ D
sgn.p/ sin jpj.

In what follows, we shall be interested in determining the zeros of the quaternion
sine and cosine hyperbolic functions, i.e., the solutions of the equations sinh.p/ D
0H and cosh.p/ D 0H. In order to fully understand the meaning of these expressions,
we must keep in mind that the functions sinh.p/ and cosh.p/ are not periodic and

have inﬁnitely many zeros; we must further have a clear agreement on how both
notions should be mastered. The zeros of the function sinh.p/ are the solutions for
p of the equation ep D ep, which can be rewritten as e2p D 1H. Since e2p D 1H
only when jVec.2p/j is an integer multiple of 2 sgn.p/, we conclude that the zeros
of sinh.p/ are the numbers n sgn.p/, n D 0; ˙1; ˙2; : : :. Similarly, the zeros of
cosh.p/ are the solutions for p of the equation ep D ep, which can be rewritten
as e2p D 1H, or as e2psgn.p/ D 1H (since esgn.p/ D 1H). It follows that the
zeros of cosh.p/ are the numbers

quaternion hyperbolic sine and cosine.

Inverse Hyperbolic and Trigonometric
Functions
The main focus of this chapter is to study the inverses of the quaternion trigono-
metric and hyperbolic functions, and their properties. Since the quaternion trigono-
metric and hyperbolic functions are deﬁned in terms of the quaternion exponential
function ep, it can be shown that their inverses are necessarily multi-valued and can
be computed via the quaternion natural logarithm function ln.p/. The remarkable
facts we shall see here attest the great interest of these functions in mathematics.
Proofs of the most known facts are ommited.
In the sequel we shall recapitulate that for a given quaternion w equations of the
form sinh.p/ D w and cosh.p/ D w either have no solutions, or have ﬁnitely many
or inﬁnitely many solutions. The procedure outlined a few pages back to ﬁnd an
explicit formula for w is often tedious and lengthy if all the details are taken into
account, and so it is usually adequate to modify it. We summarize this discussion in
the following deﬁnition.

are called the quaternion inverse hyperbolic sine and cosine. Notice that each value
of w D sinh1.p/ satisﬁes the equation sinh.w/ D p, and, similarly, each value of
w D cosh1.p/ satisﬁes the equation cosh.w/ D p. Since the quaternion logarithm
function agrees with the real and complex logarithm functions of real and complex
arguments, these functions also agree with their counterparts for real and complex
argument. Here we also call the inverse hyperbolic sine (resp. cosine) the arcsinh
(resp. arccosh), and we will denote it by arcsinh.p/ (resp. arccosh.p/), as we shall
always do in the sequel whenever we speak of inverse hyperbolic functions. These
functions have two sources of multi-valuedness, one due to the quaternion natural

Inverse Hyperbolic and Trigonometric Functions
logarithm function ln.p/, the other due to the quaternion power functions involved.
It is evident that the quaternion inverse hyperbolic sine and cosine can be made
single-valued by specifying a single value of the quaternion logarithm and a single
value of the functions .p2C1H/1=2 and .p21H/1=2, respectively. We see at the same
time that a branch of a quaternion inverse hyperbolic function may be obtained by
choosing a branch of the quaternion logarithm and a branch of a quaternion power
function. In spite of its local multi-valuedness, the ln.p/ function has an inﬁnite
number of branches, hence so do the quaternion inverse hyperbolic sine and cosine.
In addition, the quaternion inverse hyperbolic functions have branch point-solutions
to the equations p2 ˙1H D 0H, because the functions .p2 C1H/1=2 and .p2 1H/1=2
have no solutions of .p2 C 1H/1=2 D 0H and .p2  1H/1=2 D 0H, respectively.
Because this is an introductory text, we will not discuss this topic further.

Quaternion Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent Function
The function tanh1.p/, deﬁned by
tanh1.p/ WD ln.1 C p/  ln.1  p/
2
;
is called the quaternion inverse hyperbolic tangent. In particular, if w D tanh1.p/,
then tanh.w/ D p. This function, too, agrees with its real and complex counterparts.
We shall frequently make use of another notation for the inverse hyperbolic tangent,
namely, arctanh.p/. We further assume the reader to be familiar with the fact that
the inverse tangent is a multi-valued function, since it is deﬁned in terms of the
quaternion logarithm function ln.p/. In order to supply additional information,
we reiterate that the inverse hyperbolic tangent can be made single-valued by just
specifying a single value of the quaternion logarithm.
Similar to the real and complex inverse hyperbolic functions, we deﬁne the
quaternion inverse hyperbolic cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions using the
quaternion inverse hyperbolic sine and cosine:
arccoth.p/WD arcsinh.p/
arccosh.p/; arcsech.p/WD

Inverse Hyperbolic and Trigonometric Functions
In what follows, we shall study the inverse trignometric sine, cosine and tangent
functions, which we now introduce.
8.3
Quaternion Inverse Trignometric Sine and Cosine
Functions
The functions sin1.p/ and cos1.p/, deﬁned respectively by
sin1.p/ WD sgn.p/ arcsinh .p sgn.p// ;
cos1.p/ WD sgn.p/ arccosh.p/;
are called the quaternion inverse sine and cosine. Each value of w D sin1.p/
satisﬁes the equation sin.w/ D p, and, similarly, each value of w D cos1.p/
satisﬁes the equation cos.w/ D p. We also call the inverse sine (resp. cosine) the
arcsine (resp. arccosine), and we will denote it by arcsin.p/ (resp. arccos.p/). As
the above discussion shows, the inverse sine and cosine are necessarily multi-valued
functions.
8.4
Quaternion Inverse Trignometric Tangent Function
The multi-valued function tan1.p/, deﬁned by
tan1.p/ WD sgn.p/ arctanh .p sgn.p// ;
is called the quaternion inverse tangent. Each value of w D tan1.p/ satisﬁes the
equation tan.w/ D p. The inverse tangent is often called arctangent, and will be
denoted from now on by arctan.p/.
Analogous to the real and complex inverse trigonometric functions, we deﬁne the
quaternion inverse trigonometric cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions using the
quaternion inverse trigonometric sine and cosine:
arccot.p/ WD arcsin.p/
arccos.p/;
arcsec.p/ WD

Quaternion Matrices
In a brief outline, the next portion of text describes a way of representing quaternion
matrices in such a way that quaternionic addition and multiplication correspond to
matrix addition, (scalar) matrix multiplication, and matrix transposition. Besides
the discussion of the quaternionic analogues to complex matrices, we will also
discuss the possibility of decomposing quaternions with respect to well known
matrix decompositions, which are related to solving systems of linear equations.
Even though it is self-contained, the reader will comprehend the necessity of this
notions while pursuing the subject. Our presentation is organized in such a way
that the analogies between quaternion, noncommutativity, and quaternion matrix,
on one hand, and determinant, rank, and eigenvalues, on the other, are mastered.
The relations between these concepts will come into view more clearly through the
text, motivating our insight to the problem.
To treat this topic, we assume that you either have had some experience with
matrices or are willing to learn something about them. Nowadays the study of
quaternion matrices has undoubtedly gained an increased attention. For example,
the representation of quaternions via matrices allows one to derive closed-form
solutions for algebraic systems of linear equations involving unknown parameters,
in which fast outputs and high level of data accuracy are of great concern. The set
of equations for the quaternion elements is thus represented by a single equation.
The solution can be expressed in terms of the same symbols, and matrix algebra
knowledge gives us a routine procedure for ﬁnding the latter. Since matrices can
be added (or subtracted), and multiplied together according to elementary algebraic
techniques, they form a key tool to perform linear transformations.
9.1
Quaternion Matrices
Consider a set of quaternion-valued quantities arranged in a rectangular array
containing m rows and n columns:

This array will be called an m  n quaternion matrix. The quantities ai;j .i D
1; : : : ; m; j D 1; : : : ; n/ are called the entries or components of the matrix.
The collection of all m  n quaternion matrices with entries in X (X D R, C
or H) will be denoted by Mmn.X/. For simplicity, in the case of square matrices
(m D n) we denote Mnn.X/ brieﬂy by Mn.X/. Throughout the remainder of the
text we will point out remarkable similarities and differences between these type of
matrices.
9.2
Equality
Two quaternion matrices A and B of same order m  n are said to be equal if all
of their components are equal: ai;j D bi;j, for all i D 1; : : : ; m, j D 1; : : : ; n. We
then write A D B. Two matrices of different order cannot be compared for equality.
9.3
Rank
The left (resp. right) rank of a quaternion matrix A is deﬁned as the maximum
number of columns of A that are left (resp. right) linearly independent, and is
denoted by rl.A/ (resp. rr.A/). If A is of left (resp. right) rank k, then k is also
the maximum number of rows of A that are left (resp. right) linearly independent.
Exercise 9.207. Find an example of two quaternions that are left linearly indepen-
dent, but not right linearly independent.
Solution. p D i, q D j.
The relevant facts are that, just as with real and complex matrices, one can
also deﬁne elementary row (and column) operations for quaternion matrices of
compatible sizes.
9.4
Matrix Arithmetic and Operations
Quaternion matrices can be added, subtracted, and multiplied. If A and B are
two quaternion matrices, and  a real quaternion, these operations are deﬁned as
follows:

9.4
Matrix Arithmetic and Operations
135
(i) The sum (resp. difference) A C B (resp. A  B) of two matrices A and B of
the same size is calculated by adding (resp. subtracting) entrywise;
(ii) The quaternion multiplication A is given by multiplying every entry of A on
the left-hand side by ;
(iii) The multiplication of two quaternion matrices A and B, say AB, is deﬁned
only if the number of columns of A is the same as the number of rows of B.
The matrix product AB is then given by the dot product of the corresponding
row of A and the corresponding column of B.
The familiar associative, and distributive laws of multiplication over addition hold
for quaternion matrices:
(iv) Commutative law of addition
A C B D B C A;
(v) Associative law of addition
A C .B C C/ D .A C B/ C C;

Special Quaternion Matrices
In this context, the additive identity and the multiplicative identity quaternion
matrices will be denoted by O and I, respectively. The additive identity quaternion
matrix, which acts as an annihilator element for quaternion matrix multiplication
and as the additive identity for quaternion matrix addition, is such that for any
quaternion matrix A, we have A C O D A, and AO D OA D O. Similarly,
the multiplicative identity is such that for any quaternion matrix A, we have
AI D IA D I.
As the next example shows, while the quaternion matrix addition is commutative,
the quaternion matrix multiplication is not: for example, AB and BA are not equal
in general. In case AB D BA, the quaternion matrices A and B are said to commute.

Basic Notions of Quaternion Matrices
A quaternion square matrix A is said to be: idempotent if A2 D A, Hermitian (or
self-adjoint) if A
T D A, skew-Hermitian (or anti-Hermitian) if A
T D A, unitary
if A
T D A1, normal if AA
T D A
T A, and invertible if AB D BA D I, for
some matrix B. Two quaternion matrices A and B are said to be congruent if there
exists an invertible matrix C such that B D C
T AC. The conditions required in
these deﬁnitions imply that we are dealing with square matrices. For a more uniﬁed
formulation we emphasize that the symbol A means the quaternion conjugate of
the matrix A, which is the matrix obtained by taking the conjugate of each entry in
A. Clearly, A
T is the transpose of A, that is the matrix obtained by interchanging
the rows with the columns. In this sense, a quaternion hermitian matrix can be
understood as the quaternionic extension of complex symmetric matrices. Just as
for complex matrices, henceforth we denote A
T simply by A. The negative A is
the matrix formed by changing the signs of all the entries of A, while the matrix
A1 is the multiplicative inverse of A. Quaternion skew-Hermitian matrices can be
then understood as the quaternionic versions of complex skew-symmetric matrices.

Quaternion Conjugate of a Matrix
Let A and B be two quaternion matrices and  a real quaternion. The quaternion
conjugate has the following properties:
(i) A C B D A C B;
A D A ;
(ii) AB ¤ B A in general;
(iii) A D A;
(iv) A1 ¤ .A/1 in general.
Property (i) can be extended to three or more quaternion matrices, i.e.,
A1 C A2 C    C An D A1CA2C  CAn, i.e., the conjugate of a sum of quaternion
matrices is the sum of the conjugates of the terms in the sum. However, the equalities
AB D B A and A1 D .A/1 do not hold in general. To see, say, that (iv) holds,
take for example

.A/1 D .A1/ if A is invertible;
(v) For each A there exists a unitary matrix U such that U AU is in upper
triangular form [7].
Property (i) can be extended to the general case of an arbitrary number of
quaternion matrices. For example, .A1 C A2 C : : : C An/T D AT

On the contrary, .A1A2    An1An/T D AT

the sum of the transposes of the terms in the sum. The transpose of a product of
quaternion matrices is in general not equal to the product of the transposes of each
factor in the reverse order.

(resp. nonnegative) for any nonzero X. We have a list of properties:
(i) If A is positive deﬁnite (resp. semi-positive deﬁnite), then the elements on the
diagonal of A are all positives (resp. nonnegative);
(ii) If A is diagonal, then A is positive deﬁnite (resp. semi-positive deﬁnite) if and
only if the elements on the diagonal of A are all positive (resp. nonnegative);
(iii) If Hermitian matrices A and B are congruent, then A is positive deﬁnite (resp.
semi-positive deﬁnite) if and only if B is positive deﬁnite (resp. semi-positive

Quaternion Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
For quaternion matrices an eigenvalue theory can be developed similar to that for
complex matrices. However, due to the noncommutativity of multiplication, we need
to treat Ax D x and Ax D x separately. In the quaternionic case the following
generalization holds. Let A be a quaternion matrix and consider the equation
Ax D xr
.resp: Ax D lx/;
(9.1)
where r (resp. l) is a quaternion and x is a quaternion vector. If (9.1) has a
nonzero solution x, then r (resp. l) is called a right (resp. left) characteristic root or
eigenvalue of the matrix A and x is called a corresponding quaternion eigenvector.
Moreover, we state the following results:
(i) Every n  n quaternion matrix has at least one left eigenvalue in H [60],
(ii) Any nn quaternion matrix has exactly n right eigenvalues, which are complex
numbers with nonnegative imaginary parts [7,33],
(iii) If A 2 Mmn.H/, with m < n, then Ax D 0H has a nonzero solution,
(iv) If A 2 Mn.H/ is in triangular form, then every diagonal element is a right
eigenvalue of A. Conversely, every right eigenvalue of A is similar to a diagonal
entry of A [7].

Spectrum of a Quaternion Matrix
The set fr 2 H W Ax D xr; for some x ¤ 0g is called the right spectrum of A,
denoted by r.A/. The left spectrum is deﬁned similarly and is denoted by l.A/.
The following example illustrates how we calculate the (left) eigenvalues of a
given quaternion matrix.
Example. Find the left spectrum of the matrix A D
0H 1H
1H 0H

.
Solution. First we write Ax D lx as .lI  A/x D 0, and assume that lI  A
is invertible for all l 2 H. The left spectrum of A is then the set of quaternionic
solutions of 2
l C 1H D 0H, which is a two-dimensional sphere.

Prove that if l is a left eigenvalue of A, then qlq is also a left eigenvalue of A.
What can you conclude if A has quaternion-valued entries?
Exercise 9.235. Let A be a quaternion matrix and let r 2 H be a right eigenvalue
of A. If  2 H n f0Hg, then 1r is also a right eigenvalue of A.
Exercise 9.236. Let A be an upper triangular quaternion matrix. Prove that a
quaternion l is a left eigenvalue of A if and only if l is a diagonal entry.
To continue the exposition, we present the following results:

Right Eigenvalue Equalities
Let A be a quaternion matrix, r one of its right eigenvalues, and x a corresponding
vector. Let r be a right eigenvalue of A
T , with y a corresponding vector. Then
r xT y D xT y r:
Let us prove this relation. By assumption A x D x r, and A
T y D y r, and since
the equality .AB/T D .B/T .A/T holds for two quaternion matrices A and B, we
have
r xT y D .xT A
T / y D xT .A
T y/ D xT y r:

Quaternion Matrices
Using the above relation, it can be proved that a quaternion Hermitian matrix has
real right eigenvalues only. For the proof, let r be a right eigenvalue of A with x as
a corresponding vector. It is clear that r is also a right eigenvalue of A
T (= A) with
vector x. From the relation above it follows that
r xT x D xT x r:
Since xT x is a real number different from zero, we have r D r.
Exercise 9.237. Two quaternion square matrices A and B are said to be similar if
there exists an invertible quaternion matrix S of the same size such that S1AS D
B. Prove that then A and B have the same right eigenvalues.

Monomials, Polynomials and Binomials
In this chapter we will be primarily interested in the study of monomials and
polynomials within the framework of quaternion analysis. Monomials and their
applications to combinatorics and number theory have become increasingly impor-
tant for the study of a large number of problems that arise in many different
contexts, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. At the same time, the
applications of polynomials to classical and numerical analysis, including approxi-
mation theory, statistics, combinatorics, number theory, group representations etc.,
as well as in physics, including quantum mechanics and statistical physics, and in
system theory and signal processing have played a key role in this development and
continue to do it today. For example, polynomials are often used in the treatment of
problems, mainly in mathematical physics, and also in studies related to differential
equations, continued fractions, and numerical stability. In advanced mathematics,
polynomials are used to construct polynomial rings, a central concept in abstract
algebra and algebraic geometry.
In the remainder of the chapter we are going to introduce into the realm of
quaternion numbers the concept of binomial coefﬁcient, which can be proﬁtably
thought as one of the most important combinatorial counting tools. Central to this
viewpoint are certain binomial sums involving quaternions, which as in the real
and complex cases, should be familiar to the reader. We restrict ourselves mainly
to the most important special binomial coefﬁcients in which the novelty lies in the
arrangement, and also in some of the proofs.
We hope that after studying these examples the reader will be at least partly con-
vinced of the power of the method, as well as of the beauty of the uniﬁed approach.
Every effort has been made to make this chapter self-contained. In particular, we
do think that a completely uniﬁed treatment of the topic is neither possible nor
desirable.

Monomials, Polynomials and Binomials
10.1
Quaternion Monomials
For real variables t, x, y, and z, the term p WD t C xi C yj C zk is called a
quaternion variable. Let n be a nonnegative integer. A quaternion monomial Mn of
degree n is deﬁned as a0p a1p    an1pan, where al 2 H .l D 0; 1; : : : ; n/ and
such that Mn.0/ D 0H. The degree (or order) of a quaternion monomial is the sum
of the exponents of the powers of p. For example, .1 C i/p.1 C j C k/ pk is a
quaternion monomial of degree 2. Two quaternion monomials M1 and M2 are said
to be similar, if there exist two real quaternions a and b such that M1 D aM2b and
the degree of M1 is equal to the degree of M2.
Example. Deﬁne g.p/ D pn for p 2 H, and also set g.1/ D 1. Prove that the
monomial g has exactly degree n.
Solution. We shall use induction on the degree of g in order to prove our statement.
To start with, note that for n D 1 the assertion is evident, i.e. p D b0qb1
where b0; b1 are real quaternions. Suppose that our assertion is valid for all n:
pn D a0qa1    qan. We shall now prove that it is valid for n C 1. A direct
computation shows that
pnC1 D pnp D a0qa1    qanp D a0qa1    qanb0qb1:
Denoting anb0 D c1, we conclude that pnC1 D a0qa1 : : : qc1qb1. From the
deﬁnition of the quaternion monomial it follows that pnC1 is a monomial of degree
n C 1.
Exercise 10.238. Determine the degree of the following quaternion monomials: (a)

(b) .1  i  j/pkpjp.1 C k/;

Quaternion Monomials Arithmetic and Operations
Quaternion monomials can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. Let Mn1
and Mn2 be two quaternion monomials, with n1 and n2 nonnegative integers, and 
a real quaternion. These operations are deﬁned as follows:
(i) The sum (resp. difference) Mn1 C Mn2 (resp. Mn1  Mn2) of two monomials
Mn1 and Mn2 is calculated by adding (resp. subtracting) the coefﬁcients of the
similar terms;
(ii) The quaternion multiplication Mn1 is given by .a0pa1p    an1pan/ D
.a0/pa1    an1pan;
(iii) The multiplication of two quaternion monomials Mn1 and Mn2, say Mn1Mn2,
is the standard product of quaternions;
(iv) The right- (resp. left-) quotient of two quaternion monomials Mn1 and Mn2, say
Mn1M 1
n2 (resp., M 1
n2 Mn1), is the standard quotient of quaternions.
The familiar associativity, and distributivity laws of multiplication over addition
hold for quaternion monomials:
(v) Commutativity law of addition
Mn1 C Mn2 D Mn2 C Mn1 for all Mn1; Mn2 2 H;
(vi) Associativity law of addition
Mn1 C .Mn2 C Mn3/ D .Mn1 C Mn2/ C Mn3 for all Mn1; Mn2; Mn3 2 H;
(vii) (Left-)distributivity law of multiplication over addition
Mn1.Mn2 C Mn3/ D Mn1Mn2 C Mn1Mn3 for all Mn1; Mn2; Mn3 2 H;
(viii) (Right-)distributivity law of multiplication over addition
.Mn2 C Mn3/Mn1 D Mn2Mn1 C Mn3Mn1 for all Mn1; Mn2; Mn3 2 H;
(ix) Associativity law of multiplication
.Mn1Mn2/Mn3 D Mn1.Mn2Mn3/ for all Mn1; Mn2; Mn3 2 H.

As a brief preview of the material presented in a further chapter, we proceed by
recalling the notion of quaternion polynomial. Until we reach this point the reader
is asked to subdue his quest for complete rigor.
10.3
Quaternion Polynomials
Let p be a quaternion variable, n and m nonnegative integers. A quaternion poly-
nomial Pn.p/ of degree n is a ﬁnite linear combination of quaternion monomials:
a0 pa1    pan CMm.p/, where al 2 H .l D 0; 1; : : : ; n/ and Mm.p/ is a ﬁnite sum
of quaternion monomials of degree m  n. The degree (or order) of a quaternion
polynomial is the largest of the degrees of the monomials, forming this polynomial.
For example, .2 C k/pjp  pj C ip C k is a quaternion polynomial of degree 2.
Notice that neither t  1
x i C yzk nor 7yz1=2j are quaternion polynomials, since the
ﬁrst one involves division by the variable x and the second one contains an exponent
that is not an integer. There are situations in which the sum (difference), the product
and division of quaternion polynomials are again quaternion polynomials.
Exercise 10.244. Determine the degree of the following quaternion polynomials:
(a) g.p/ D ipk C .1 C i/p.1 C j/p C kpipj;
(b) g.p/ D i C .1  i  j/p.1 

Solution. (a) 2;

and q.j/ D 1  2j C 3k.

Exercise 10.246. Find a polynomial g.p/ D .p  b/.ipk  j/pi such that g.k/ D

Solution. g.p/ D .p  1 C i C j/.ipk  j/pi.
10.4
Factoring and Roots of Quaternion Polynomials
Roughly speaking, the process of factoring a quaternion polynomial is the opposite
of multiplying quaternion polynomials. Recall that usually when we factor a real
number, we are looking for prime factors that multiplied together give this number;
for example 6 D 2 3, or 12 D 2 2 3. When we factor a quaternion polynomial,
it is often useful to look for simpler polynomials that multiplied together give us

10.4
Factoring and Roots of Quaternion Polynomials
153
the polynomial we started with. In doing so, we are usually only interested in
decomposing into simple polynomials, by means of intuitive considerations. For
example, the polynomial p3 C p.1  j C k/p  ip2 C .1 C j C k/p can be
factored as a product of three simple polynomials: .p  i/.p C i  j C k/p. We
can’t do any better, so we can say the polynomial has been factored completely. Of
course, an intimately related concept is that of a root of a polynomial. A quaternion
number is then called a root of order l  n of the quaternion polynomial Pn.p/, if
Pn.q/ D .p  q/lMnl.p/, where Mnl.p/ is a quaternion polynomial of degree
n  l, and such that Mnl.q/ ¤ 0H.
All that is needed to understand how to factor a quaternion polynomial is:
(i) Make sure that the monomials in the polynomial are written in descending
(resp. ascending) order of degrees;
(ii) List all the possible ways to make sure there is no common monomial that you
can factor out of the polynomial.
Example. Let ˛1; ˛2
2
H be roots of the quaternion polynomial q.p/
D
p2  .1 C i C j  k/p C ,  2 H. Find  such that ˛1 C ˛2 D 1  j and
˛2
1 C ˛2
2 D 1  i  j  k.
Solution. Since ˛1; ˛2 2 H are both roots of q.p/, it follows that ˛2
1  .1 C i C j 
k/˛1C D 0H and ˛2
2.1CiCj k/˛2C D 0H. Then a direct computation shows
that ˛2
1 C˛2
2 .1Ci Cj k/.˛1 C˛2/C2 D 0H. Hence,  D 1
2 C 1
2i C 1

Exercise 10.247. Let ˛1; ˛2 2 H be roots of the quaternion polynomial g.p/ D
p2  pj  ip C ,  2 H. Find  such that ˛1˛2 D k, and ˛1  ˛2 D i  j.
Solution. g.p/ D p2  pj  ip C k.
Exercise 10.248. Prove that p D i  j is a root of second order of the polynomial
f .p/ D p2  pi C pj  ip C jp  2.
Before proceeding, let’s pause for a moment to develop some intuition about
which motivation is likely to succeed. For natural numbers n; k  0, the central
binomial coefﬁcient
n
k

plays an important role in many areas of mathematics,
including statistics, combinatorics and number theory. For instance, the underlying
transformation techniques are used extensively in the analysis of series and in their
closed-form representations. Analogous to the natural numbers, an easy example
for the relationship between the central binomial coefﬁcient and quaternions may
be the following. If p is an arbitrary element of H and we consider the monomials
.1H C p/n and develop them as binomials whenever jpj < 1, we may see that the
binomial coefﬁcient
n
k

is deﬁned as the coefﬁcient of the monomial pk.
It is time to explore the possibility of introducing binomial coefﬁcients involving
quaternions.

Quaternion Binomial
Let p be a real quaternion. We deﬁne the quaternion binomial coefﬁcient as
 
p
n
!
WD p .p  1/    .p  n C 1/
nŠ
for all integers n  0, with initial values
p
0

D 1H and
p
1

D p. When n is a
negative integer the binomial coefﬁcient
p
n

equals zero.
Of course, instead of writing Pn
kD0
p
k

, we can also write P1
kD1
p
k

, because
the underlying binomial coefﬁcients vanish on all of the extra values of k that appear
in the second form of the sum. These conventions may save us a lot of work in
the sequel, mainly in that we won’t have to worry about changing the limits of
summation if we change the variable of summation by a constant shift.
Although the best motivation for the above characterization is the fact that it
works, let’s pause for a moment before proceeding, to see why it is likely to
work. One may show by elementary reasoning that the neutral quaternion binomial
elements of addition and multiplication, and the associated results of addition
(resp. subtraction) and multiplication are unique. From these conditions one can
derive all the usual rules for manipulation of quaternion binomial coefﬁcients.
The student who is not thoroughly familiar with this way of introducing binomial
coefﬁcients should consult any textbook in which a full axiomatic treatment of
binomial coefﬁcients is given.
We begin by evaluating certain quaternion binomial coefﬁcients by application
of a fundamental recurrence relation in much the same manner as ordinary binomial
coefﬁcients may be treated.

The ﬁrst statement is immediate. Next, to prove the well-known Pascal’s rule
involving quaternion binomial coefﬁcients, we use induction. For n D 0 the
assertion is evident. Let n  1. Since

By algebraic calculation, we can easily deduce the well-known subset-of-a-subset
identity for quaternion binomial coefﬁcients. Now we shall prove property (v). For
n D 0 the equality is evident. We suppose that

Lastly, property (vi) simply reverses the order of summation of elements in a
quaternion binomial coefﬁcient. The summation may be written as follows

which includes n C 1 entries downward. By the previous statement, the value of the
previous sum is the quaternion binomial coefﬁcient
