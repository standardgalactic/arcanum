I. INTRODUCTION
Kanji Mnemonics is an instruction manual for learning Japanese characters. It
incorporates powerful mnemonic (memory-assisting) devices to help students learn all
1,945 kanji in everyday use in Japan. The manual assumes only a basic knowledge of
Japanese grammar and the kana and is suitable for self-study or use in a classroom
setting.
Kanji Mnemonics employs many interactive strategies to facilitate learning kanji. The
manual is cumulative in its approach: simple kanji, radicals and elements are learned
first and form the basis for the more complex characters that come later. Kanji are
organized into natural groups based on mnemonically effective affinities. Structural
elements that form each complex kanji are listed and cross-indexed. Finally, kanji are
assigned 'mnemonic strings' to make their meanings highly memorable for beginners
and advanced students alike.
Although Kanji Mnemonics takes a modern, pragmatic approach to learning kanji, it also
encourages a sympathetic appreciation of the etymology of these enduring characters
and their great antiquity. A brief account of the kanji as pictographs or ideographs and
their historic evolution are therefore given in Section I.
Section II presents 98 basic kanji, many of which are derived from simple pictures and
symbols. In Section Ill, kanji are presented in groups that have a common structure and
the same ON reading (Sound Groups). Section IV contains groups of kanji that have
common structures but whose ON readings are not all the same (Mixed Sound and
Structure Groups). Section V contains groups of kanji that have common structures but
different ON readings (Structure Groups).
Within each of the Sound, Mixed and Structure groups, kanji are presented in graded
levels of difficulty, which is usually (but not always) a function of the number of strokes
required to write them. Although the assignment of kanji to levels of difficulty tends to be
somewhat arbitrary, there seems little doubt that a Level 1 kanji such as
~ is a lot
easier to learn than a Level 3 kanji such as
~f1. As the simple kanji are mastered, it
becomes easier and easier to cope with the difficult ones.

Kanji Came from China
Historically the Japanese people had no written language of their own. Starting in about
the fourth century AD and peaking in the sixth, they began borrowing the Chinese
system of writing. Since Chinese and Japanese are entirely different spoken languages,
the use of Chinese characters (in Japan called kanji, literally characters from Han
China) to write Japanese was an unmitigated disaster. At first the sound of the
borrowed characters was used to spell out Japanese words, and the Chinese meaning
was ignored. This was an inefficient and awkward way of doing things. For example, the
character for the sound KI
~ is highly complex and requires 12 strokes to write (it
takes just four strokes with the Roman alphabet). Later, Chinese characters were taken
for their meaning only and given a Japanese pronunciation. As a result, nearly
two-thirds of kanji today have both a Chinese and Japanese pronunciation (called a
'reading'). The Japanese also supplemented the Chinese system of writing with two
alphabets (called hiragana and katakana) of their own, each having some 45 different
letters. The end result was, in the words of one exasperated writer, an insanely
complicated system of writing.
Kanji are Picture Words
Some three thousand years ago when people in China (priests, most likely) wanted to
record something, they drew pictures. What is written down can be preserved and
transmitted to others and pictures are undeniably the best way of conveying some kinds
of information. In our age of information overload, we use pictures with increasing
frequency to convey messages effortlessly in the blink of an eye. The modern
equivalent of kanji are everywhere these days- on the doors of every public washroom,
on highway signs, in airports, on computer screens, on the products we buy- informing
us, directing us or warning us in a way that mere words cannot match.
So Why Don't I Get the Picture?
If picture words convey information in such a direct and meaningful way, why are the
characters that form the backbone of the Chinese and Japanese systems of writing
utterly incomprehensible to us when we first encounter them? Why are kanji so difficult?
And why does it seem to take forever to learn kanji? A simple answer is that the
situation was not always like this. Once, common pictographs (pictures of things) and
ideographs (symbolic representations of intangibles, like love or war) were relatively
straightforward. But, over thousands of years they have evolved, diverging from pictures
that almost anyone could read, to become increasingly abstract symbols. Unfortunately,
:'"J

the highly-evolved modern forms now convey little of their meaning except to those who
first spend many years studing them. For example, it is doubtful that anyone would
guess the meaning of even the simplest of kanji, such as B . Yet there is not a man,
woman or child who does not know what ~ stands for. This universal picture of the
sun is a perfect kanji. Its modern equivalent B is really a nonsense symbol. It must be
learned. The task of learning this kanji might seem trivial at first sight. After all, it does
not take much mental horse power to remember that a rectangle with a horizontal
dividing line stands for "sun". Multiply by two thousand (approximately the number of
kanji you need to know to be newspaper-literate in Japan) and the magnitude of
difficulty becomes more apparent.
How did so many kanji go from being wonderfully direct pictures to their largely
unintelligible modern forms? More importantly, how is the student of Japanese to cope
with learning a picture writing language that has all but abandoned its pictures?
Knowledge of the historical evolution of characters can help to learn them.
How the Pictures Changed
Although Chinese characters have been around for three millennia, only a few of them
can be traced back unchanged to their ancient origins. Most of them have evolved over
time to their modern forms, a process that continues, at least in the Peoples Republic of
China, to the present day. Standardized forms began to appear by the third century BC
and by 200 AD the squared 'KAISHO' form widely used today in East Asia, including
Japan, had become established.
The history of a kanji mayor may not help you to learn it. A long or convoluted or
obscure etymology, while fascinating in its own right, may serve no useful mnemonic
purpose. In Kanji Mnemonics, we cite the historical development of a kanji only when it
serves as a direct memory aid. When we are etymologically silent, the reader can
assume that no such purpose would be served.
Many kinds of evolutionary change have been identified by scholars. Some of the more
common processes leading to change are as follows:
Drift
A living language never stays the same. Change to its written form may occur
as the result of intervention of governments bent on reform but in fact a lot of change is
simply the result of drift. The historical development of many Chinese characters has
been traced back in time by studying primitive characters first written on bone and
tortoise shell, by studying characters on inscriptions, in court documents, poetry, letters
and in various types of manuscripts and records that may span hundreds and
sometimes thousands of years. For some characters, the etymological trail quickly

grows cold and their origins remain lost forever in the mists of time. Scholars may also
disagree about the etymology of individual characters and it is not uncommon for there
to be competing theories.
Copying Error
Chinese characters were developed and written long before the
invention of printing presses and Xerox machines. Today we take it for granted that
multiple copies of a document will all be the same. In ancient times when another copy
of a document was needed, it was copied by hand. Bad lighting, the failing eyesight of
some copyists, fatigue and human error all took their toll on the fidelity of reproduction
of handwritten manuscripts. An abrupt change in the historical development of a
character is often the product of a copying error and its perpetuation by succeeding
generations.
Copying errors have degraded the quality of characters, obscuring their meaning and
making them more difficult to learn. Kanji that are the product of a copying error are
noted in Kanji Mnemonics when it makes good didactic sense to do so.
Assignment of New Meanings to Old Characters
From time to time, the prevailing
linguistic authority has sanctioned a new meaning for an existing character. The new
meaning is said to be 'borrowed', but in plain English the character was really a picture
of something else. A character with a borrowed meaning is the ultimate nonsense
symbol and a total capitulation of the picture writing concept. These "pictures" are not
worth 1,000 words- they are not even worth one.
The student must bear up and just learn these rogues with the aid and advice of Kanji
Mnemonics.
Standardization
Early picture writing was not pretty to look at. Characters were of all
different sizes and a general anarchy in writing them prevailed. In truth, the writing
looked like the dog's dinner. Such an unruly state of affairs is anathema to bureaucracy.
A standardized system of writing on squared paper was introduced. All characters were
to be written the same size, one to a square. This Procrustean bed of squares forced
many changes to be made in the way the characters were written. Round shapes were
squared to fit better (hence, the square sun referred to earlier). Since all characters-
whether composed of two or twenty strokes- had to be written the same size, there was
a reduction in the number of strokes for the more complex characters. Entire
substructures vital to the integrity of the character as a picture were dropped or
replaced by abbreviated versions. Lines that stuck out every which way in the old
pictographs were made to run straight up and down, or straight across, or were
otherwise tidied up. The characters took on a brisk new appearance but in the process
gave up much of their essential quality as pictures. Ah! the bureaucratic mind! These
squared characters, in place by 200 AD, conveyed their information more as symbols
and less as pictures.
.It

Simplification
Although simplification was one of the consequences of the squaring
process, it has also been pursued independently as an objective of its own. Note that
simplification always means a reduction in the number of strokes needed to write the
character. The 'simplified' character may not be simpler to recognize or to learn.
Indeed, the opposite is usually true. Take the case of the character for horse. Early
forms drew a picture of a horse. Later, the stylised, squared form
~ still offered some
hope of horse. With a little imagination the flowing mane, powerful rear quarters and
four hooves are all there. The new form E mandated by the People's Republic of
China looks nothing like a horse. Is it simpler? A little. Is it easier to read? Not really. Is
it easier to learn? We think not. Purists will be happy to know that the square,
horsey-looking form is still retained by Japan, and also by Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Korea.
Reforms in Japan at the end of World War 11 resulted in significant changes to writing
the Japanese language. Many kanji were simplified or replaced by others easier to write
and the number of kanji taught in school was limited to 1,850 (since increased to 1,945).
These are the so-called Joyo Kanji ~m ~l* or general use kanji. Newspapers and
magazines have been pressured by the Ministry of Education to limit themselves to the
Joyo Kanji so that anyone in Japan with a high school education would be newspaper
literate. Other kanji such as those for family and place names are learned informally, as
are kanji for technical terms and kanji used in literary works. As a result, most adults in
Japan know about 3,000 kanji. University graduates, depending on their field of
specialization, might know many more.
It's a Picture of What!?
Characters developed at a time when the world was largely agricultural in its outlook
and terms of reference. Technology was simple. Artefacts familiar in everyday life a
thousand years ago are often as obscure to us as our computers and computer icons
will be to people 100 (or maybe, 10) years from now. A few of the characters are
grounded in ancient Chinese legends or Buddhist mythology. Some characters are
based upon practices not commonly encountered any more: communal cooking pots,
sacrifices at altars, roasting of dogs. Other characters graphically depict natural (or
unnatural) events such as childbirth or sodomy. While we usually have no problem with
the words, our modern sensibility may cause us to flinch at seeing the event drawn out
in a picture, even if the picture is abstract.
There is a certain fascination in dealing with matters of such antiquity. The downside is
that many characters are based on what is no longer familiar and that makes them
more difficult to learn. It may be comforting, if not too helpful, to know that Asians have
as much trouble learning these characters as the rest of us.

The Structure of Kanji
Radicals and Elements
Complex kanji are made up of simpler structures called
radicals (denoted R in the text) and elements (E), neither of which can stand alone.
There is not much practical difference between a radical and an element. Historically,
there are 214 officially recognised radicals, the more important of which have Japanese
names. Dictionaries organize kanji according to their radicals and their place within the
structure of kanji. Entries in The Kanji Dictionary, a modern reference work, are
arranged according to Spahn & Hadamitzky's own 79-radical reference system.
Kanji Mnemonics gives every radical and element a name that embodies its meaning. In
most cases the English and Japanese designation for radicals are equivalent. In a few
cases we have created names for elements to serve mnemonic ends. It is essential to
memorize the name, meaning and structure of radicals and elements, the same as for
kanji.
Kanji as Radicals
Many kanji themselves are used as radicals to form more complex
kanji. These are designated KR in the text. Other designations are NJY for Non-Joyo
Kanji and CO for characters that are used in China only.
ON and kun Readings
As we have seen, Japan's borrowing of Chinese characters
was of two distinct sorts. At first the meaning of the character was ignored and its sound
was used to spell out Japanese words. Later, the sound of the character was ignored
and its meaning given a Japanese pronunciation. By convention, the Chinese reading
of a character (called ON) is written in uppercase Roman script or in katakana. The
Japanese reading (called kun) is written in lower case Roman script or in hiragana. Of
the 1,945 Joyo Kanji 1,166 have both ON and kun readings, 736 have ON readings
only and 43 have kun readings only.

Mnemonics- the Key to Learning Kanji
A mnemonic is something intended to assist the memory, as a verse or formula. Every
school child knows the year Columbus discovered America thanks to a humble
mnemonic. Many kinds of mnemonic devices are used in Kanji Mnemonics to assist
learning kanji. Here are some of the most powerful.
Pictographs and Ideographs Tell the Story (Sometimes)
A sympathetic
understanding of a character as pictograph or ideograph is often powerfully mnemonic.
A little historical perspective can also be helpful. Knowing that the kanji for power j]
was once a pictograph of a biceps helps to remember it, even though the modern form
may not look much like a biceps. A lot of imagination and a flexible frame of mind are
needed.
Mnemonic Strings for Complex Kanji
In this mnemotechnique, simple kanji,
radicals or elements present in a complex kanji are strung together to 'synthesize' its
meaning. Some strings may seem better than others because they make sense. For
example, the complex kanji for wealth is composed of two simpler kanji, money and
talent, written side by side. The character for wealth is easily remembered from the
string:"Money and talent bring wealth", But a mnemonic string does not have to make
sense for it to be memorable. The kanji for permit is composed of words and noon.
Permit is also easily remembered from the string: "Words at noon are permitted', even
though this string does not make a whole lot of sense.
Memory devices tend to be personal and if one in Kanji Mnemonics does not suit you,
make up another. Just make sure to write it down and to use the same string the same
way every time. A half-remembered, muddled mnemonic is no mnemonic at all!
Natural Groupings of Kanji
We learn things better when they are in like groups. A
powerful mnemotechnic is to learn kanji in groups in which there is a common theme.
The natural groupings found on every page of Kanji Mnemonics will help you to quickly
learn kanji that have common structural elements and the same or different ON
readings.
Kanji in Compound Words
We learn kanji so that we can read and write Japanese.
But knowing a kanji is only half the battle. There is still the business of learning the
meaning of compound words that contain the kanji. In English, learning just the
alphabet would hardly be sufficient for someone to be able to read and write it! A
vocabulary is essential for any language. Students who take up the study of kanji may
already have a Japanese vocabulary, from speaking the language or from reading text
written in romaji or hiragana. Learning kanji and building vocabulary can interact
synergistically to reinforce one another. For example, the ON reading for the kanji
~~ is
:'7

SHOO, and its primary meaning is general or commander-in-chief. Unfortunately, there
are 65 other kanji that are also read SHOO, each with a different meaning. It is easy to
distinguish
~~ from all the others because it is used to write SHOOGUN
~~~ ,a word
familiar to everyone. By learning
~~~, you also get reinforcement for the kanji GUN
* which means army. A shogun is the commander-in-chief of the army.
Although the primary function of Kanji Mnemonics is not vocabulary building, we take
advantage of synergistic interaction and give at least one compound word in which the
kanji occurs to illustrate its meaning. Learn this word with the same vigour and intensity
as you do for the kanji itself. It is inevitable that compound words will contain kanji that
have not yet been learned. Use hiragana for these for the time being, then come back
to the compound word after you have formally learned its second (or third) kanji. It is a
powerful way to review.
Stroke Order
Kanji must be written in the correct stroke order as prescribed by the
Ministry of Education. Writing a kanji with the same stroke order every time is mnemonic
in itself. After writing a character tens or hundreds of times, the very act of writing it may
become neurally embedded in the brain's circuitry. An unconcious, automatic response
may help carry you through the writing process and keep you from getting stuck part
way through.
Kanji Cards
The best mnemonic technique of all is repetition. You will need to go
over kanji hundreds (yes) of times before you really know them. Kanji cards are a good
way to drill. Sooner or later every student makes up a set. Buy 3 x 5 inch (7.6 x 12.8
cm) index cards lined on one side. On the unlined side write the kanji. On the lined side
write its ON and kun reading and meaning. Keep a pack of cards with you at all times
and make use of your spare moments on the bus or at lunch time for drilling. When you
can give the ON and kun reading and meaning after seeing each kanji, turn the pack
over and write (or visualize) the kanji from the ON-kun-meaning side of the card. Always
drill from both sides. Start small: 10 cards at the beginning, then work up to 20, then 50
and finally 100. A pack of 100 seems to be the largest physically manageable size. Get
some elastic bands so the cards don't drift around in your purse or briefcase. When you
are confident that you know all the cards in a set, shuffle the pack and drill some more.
Drill the next day and the next day after that. Never give up!
Mature students will have 20 sets of index cards each having 100 cards. A one per
week set rotation ensures that every kanji will be reviewed at least twice a year. By
pulling kanji cards for those that you always remember, it is possible to reduce the set
size and/or the number of sets thereby making it possible to review the really difficult
kanji many times per year.

Other Tools for Learning Kanji
Computers
A broad selection of computer software on CD-ROM is available for
studying spoken and written Japanese. The quality and utility of the software varies, so
it is a case of buyer beware. Some developers find it easy and inexpensive to put out
books and software for learning 200 to 300 kanji, i.e., the number that a grade three
student knows. If you are serious about learning kanji, you really do not need these!
Two things can be said about computer-assisted learning for kanji: it is relatively
expensive and it is not very portable (although becoming less so on both accounts,
thanks to affordable lap top computers). Try to learn a few hundred kanji on your own
before investing in software. You will be a more discerning customer and undoubtedly
will make a better choice.
Learning kanji is hard, tedious work. If a computer can keep you at it, then by all means
go this route.
Dictionaries
Sooner or later every student recognizes the need for a good kanji
dictionary. We recommend The Kanji Dictionary by Spahn and Hadamitzsky (Appendix
1).
Electronic dictionaries, such as the Canon Wordtank Super Series of hand-held
electronic dictionaries, are wonderful if you have the money.
Other Kanji Texts
Although we would like to think that Kanji Mnemonics is the only
text you will ever need to learn kanji, there are other texts with merit. Their strengths,
weaknesses and suitability are evaluated in Appendix 1.

GENERAL RULES FOR WRITING KANJI
First Steps
Before you write your first kanji, become familiar with the General Rules
for Writing Kanji in the section below. Refer back to the General Rules often at the
beginning. After a few hundred kanji have been learned, a sixth sense for stroke order
will set in.
If you seem to be having trouble with proportion and symmetry and your kanji look a
little lop-sided, tracing kanji in the text a few times may help.
Make a grid of squares on plain white paper and practice writing kanji of uniform size in
each square.
Stroke Direction
1. Horizontal strokes are written from left to right; verical strokes from top to bottom.
Exceptions: in a combination of short, slanting strokes on the left, the last is written with
an up-stroke.
2. Strokes may end bluntly, with a tiny hook or with a sharp taper. These effects are
obtained easily with a brush but not so readily with a ball point pen or a pencil.
Whatever your instrument, finesse your strokes for authentic-looking kanji.

A Final Word...
How Many Kanji Do You Really Need to Know?
When I was advised that I had
been awarded a Fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, I had
six months to wind down my research projects in Canada, plan new research for Japan
and, incidentally, learn Japanese. Scientists, like most, are optimists and we believe in
the 20%-80% principle, i.e., for 20% of the effort one can often achieve 80% of a
desired result, be it in languages or fitness or any other human endeavour. I knew that it
would be impossible to learn 1,945 kanji in six months, but it might just be possible to
learn 20% of them (say 400) and become reasonably literate. This scenario seemed all
the more appealing when I discovered that the kanji in Hadamitzky and Spahn's Kanji &
Kana were listed in order of their most frequent usage. Not only could I save time by
learning just a few kanji- they would be the ones I would most likely encounter. It was a
strategy that could not fail! When I arrived in Japan, I found of course that I was
completely illiterate. The bus that went by my university went on to the small coastal
village of jl~ written with kanji numbers 756 and 951 in the Hadamitzky and Spahn
text and beyond the scope of my 400. I could not even read a simple bus sign to catch
the bus! How many kanji do you really need to know? All 1,945 of the Joyo Kanji and
quite a few more for comfort. The good news is that if you can learn 400 kanji, you can
learn the rest. It just takes longer.
How Fast Can You learn Them?
The basic unit of learning in Kanji Mnemonics is
one page and there are nearly four hundred pages of kanji. One page a day would put
the task at just over a year. This may be too arduous for most because it requires study
seven days a week. One page a day for a 4- or 5-day week plus a day or two for a
weekly review puts the task closer to two years and may be about right. It is a serious
error to try to go too quickly without consolidation because the organization of Kanji
Mnemonics is cumulative. It is essential to incorporate regular review periods into any
program of study.
Formal testing and self-testing are an integral part of the review process. Start by
testing your ability to read the kanji from the top row of the pages being reviewed. You
must be able to give the ON and kun readings, the meaning(s), and the representative
compounds containing the kanji. Second, you must be able to write the kanji from
memory using the correct stroke order. Recalling the mnemonic string helps get the
radicals and elements right. Write the compounds too, but use hiragana for kanji that
have not been formally studied. Finally, test from randomly drawn kanji cards on a
regular, rotational basis.
