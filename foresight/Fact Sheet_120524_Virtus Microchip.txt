JOINTLY-DEVELOPED BY NTU & I²R 
 
Technical Specifications 
 
• Complete solution for IEEE 802.11ad standard, including integrated antenna, 
RF, MAC/PHY 
• 2-chip solution (RF: 0.18um SiGe process; MAC/PHY: 65nm process) 
• Data rate: ~ 2.5Gbps (about 1,000 times faster than Bluetooth v2.0) 
• System power consumption: < 500mW 
• Output power level: > 4dBm 
• Applications: Type IV for mobile/portable applications 
 
 
Key Features 
 
• RF Transceiver chip (developed by NTU) 
o Wideband tuning range and low-phase noise voltage-controlled 
oscillator (VCO) with strongly-coupled LC tanks 
o Compact, passive and integrated low pass filter with low insertion loss, 
excellent linearity and superior stop-band performance 
o New standing-wave switch with near-zero insertion loss 
o Fully integrated Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) protection circuits for 
all types of Input/Output (I/O) pads for millimetre-wave applications 
 
• MAC/PHY Baseband chip (developed by I²R) 
o Unique parallel processing architecture, to keep chip processing speed 
low 
o Novel low-power multi-code rate decoder architecture 
o Non-linear analog signal processing 
 
 

Modes of Measurement 
 
1 Gigabyte (GB) = 8 Gigabits (Gb) 
1 Megabyte (MB) = 8 Megabits (Mb) 
 
Bit: Smallest unit of information stored on a computer 
 
Byte: The number of bits needed to represent letters of the alphabet and other 
characters. General unit used to measure disk storage capacity
