Preface
When we look at abstract paintings, drawings, sculptures, and other abstract forms
of what is termed ﬁne art,1 how do we understand these experiences? Perhaps we
see a mess, a clutter or a confusion of lines, shapes and textures, and perhaps an
array of vivid colour. Providing an answer to the question of just what it is we see
when we look at abstract artworks has been a challenge accepted by many authors
(see for example, Crowther 2007; Crowther and Wunsche 2012), including myself
(Hackett 2013, 2016). In relation to two-dimensional artworks, these authors and I,
have attempted to shed light upon what I call ﬁgure–ground mereology2 where
ﬁgure and ground are parts of the whole artwork, are related to this totality and
where the parts have structural interrelationships. In this essay, I will offer my
contribution to the debate about the perception of abstract art: speciﬁcally, art that is
both abstract and three dimensional.
In an attempt to establish such an understanding, I will consider how, in the
general course of our lives, we perceive the visual ﬁeld that stretches out before us,
and more speciﬁcally, the way in which we perceive three-dimensional works of art
that are understood to be abstract rather than ﬁgurative or directly representational.
A central concern within this essay is the relationships that exist between a
three-dimensional artwork and its context in situations where context is central to
the artworks’ perception (be these ﬁgurative, concrete representations of reality or
non-representational forms of art) within our visual ﬁelds. Furthermore, the
1Fine art is sometimes called studio art in the US and is usually thought to consist of painting,
drawing, sculpture, printmaking, and other forms of predominantly visual art. Within this grouping
of art products, ﬁne art is primarily or exclusively associated with viewer appreciating such
artworks in terms of their content which is intellectual (a person’s mental abilities applied to
achieve understanding objectively through reasoning), imaginative (the construction of novel
ideas, concepts or images from what we sense but which is not present for the senses) or aesthetic
(that which is associated with beauty or the creation of beauty). Furthermore, it is often assumed
that to create ﬁne art requires great skill on the part of the artist and knowledge and discernment on
the part of the viewer.
2Mereological is that which pertains to mereology, where mereology is the study of part to whole
relationships.

exploitation by the artist of the relationships in two-dimensional artwork between
ﬁgure and ground elements forms the basis for the creation of the perceived art
image. In three-dimensional works of art, this relationship delimits objects and
forms: Within some deﬁnitions of art, ﬁgure–ground and object–context are the
components of an artwork that facilitate the artist’s mereological account and
convey meaning.
Mereology is a term found in philosophical writing and thinking. Literally,
mereology means the study of parts and wholes and their associations. In philos-
ophy, mereology is usually composed of a series of part–whole relationships that
are somewhat formally speciﬁed through algebraic equations. When thinking about
abstract, two- and three-dimensional visual art, what constitutes the perception of
this mereological amalgam of object, ﬁgure or form, positive and negative space,
may become almost duplicitous: Perceptions of abstract forms of artwork are
particularly and speciﬁcally multi-faced as they embody uncertainty. At the same
time, and in contrast to ﬁgurative art, non-representative art more clearly exposes
the ways in which the three-dimensional art object may be incorporated within, and
differentiated from, its context by the artist. Without seeking recourse to the use of
ﬁgurative
elements

to

associations and

itself
becomes part of the artwork. During the following pages, I will brieﬂy review how
we structure our observations of visual objects.3
A vast literature exists that explores the nature of how we conceive of the world
around us. As vision, forms the major sense through which we assemble our
worldview I will spend time looking at a selection of these visual worldviews. In
one sense, these worldviews may be considered ontologies. Ontology is the study of
being and the properties of being, as these properties are shared across material and
non-material entities. Ontology is concerned with the understanding the funda-
mental categories of existence.4
Husserl (1859–1938) advanced a categorial system in his Logical Investigations
(1913–21) (Fisette 2003) of a ‘pure theory of objects’. In his ontology, Husserl
proposed the categories of: object, state of affairs, property, genus, species, unity,
plurality, number, relation, connection, series, part, whole, dependence, magnitude,
open and closed, set, boundary, manifold, space, time, movement, causality, etc.
From this list, it can be seen that Husserl’s ontology is an extremely comprehensive
account of the more basic elements of life. Husserl was stating an ontological
framework, where these categories form an understanding of our being or exis-
tence, where this ontology may also be employed to deﬁne a manner in which we
comprehend the nature of being human.
In any attempt to explain how human beings experience their existence, a subset
of ontological categories may be selected in order to form boundaries around and to
3What I mean when I use the term art object is a work of ﬁne art that is not a painting, drawing, or
print, but is a three-dimensional object or an art event within space.
4An ontology is also a model or representation of the basic elements of our experience.

Preface

delimit an existential domain. In this essay I will attempt to establish the bounds,
and internal sub-divisions of, the experience of three-dimensional abstract ﬁne art.
I liken the application and/or functional processes of an ontology to those of a
worldview as both delimit our experiences. Ontologies and worldviews deﬁne what
we consider valid and thus determine the scope of our theorizing and the statements
that arise from our speculations. Formal ontology is the systematic understanding
of the forms of entities and states of being in the world. As well as ruminating upon
ontologies as totalities I will reﬂect upon the separate parts of the world, as we
understand this, and the parts relate to each other and to the whole (ontology)
itself.5
I have speciﬁc reasons for focussing upon the concepts of ontology and mere-
ology. The ﬁrst of these is that I have used mapping sentences and facet theory in
my earlier research. These approaches incorporate an implicit ontological per-
spective that has helped me to identify the basic units through which we experience
of an artwork (an ontological account). Furthermore, the mapping sentence
approach can also model the interrelationships between the basic ontological ele-
ments of an artwork (a mereological account). In my earlier research I have used
facet
theory
approaches
to
produce
understanding
of
how
we
perceive
two-dimensional artworks. In the current research, I attempt to extend this under-
standing by developing a mereological/ontological account of three-dimensional
artworks located within the visual ﬁeld.6
Several writers and scholars have exerted an important inﬂuence upon the
writing in this book. Of these authors, I will especially be considering the writing of
art historian and writer Rosalind Krauss,7 who has written a great deal about the
visual ﬁeld and how both two-dimensional and three-dimensional artworks occupy
this space. In particular, she has deliberated over how artists from the modernist
milieu have used devices such as ﬁgure and ground in their two-dimensional works
and how land artists have explored notions of the extended visual ﬁeld in their
three-dimensional creations.8 In the case of three-dimensional works, Krauss dwells
upon concepts of the extended ﬁeld of the work and offers accounts of
three-dimensional works inclusive of the location within which a work is sited. In
both two- and three-dimensional cases, Krauss emphasizes the context within
which an artwork is situated and the general context that surrounds an art object.
In terms of the two-dimensional images and three-dimensional artworks, Krauss’
seminal contribution to understanding the artwork has been the development of a
structuralists’ account that uses a ‘Klein Group Model’. Krauss claims that the
5Scholars whose thoughts are important in this part of my essay include but are not limited to:
Plato, Aristotle; Ockham; Dun Scotus; Kant and Hegel.
6When speaking about the visual ﬁeld I am deﬁning this to be the area that a person is able to see
when looking through a single eye whilst keeping their body, and especially their head,
motionless.
7For example: Krauss (1977, 1981, 2003).
8In simple terms, the extended ﬁeld is the space or area around a three-dimensional artwork or the
larger area that constitutes a work of land art, etc.

Klein group she develops is able to account for the experience of, large-scale
non-traditional three-dimensional artwork in terms of the works constituting object
(architecture) and context (landscape) relationships. The model she says spatially
and contextually locates three-dimensional works. One of the main reasons for my
writing this text is in order to allow me to critique Krauss’ Klein Group Model, to
expiate upon this and to further develop Krauss’ structural understanding within
my own ontological/mereological framework. In an attempt to evaluate and expand
upon the Klein Group Model, in this essay I address a series of questions about the
nature of Krauss’ theories. For example, when using the structure implied in the
Klein Group I ask the questions:
• How has Krauss used her model to facilitate understanding of modernist abstract
artwork?
• Does her model provide useful and original insight into the ways in which we
perceive abstract art?
• How have other researchers and scholars taken her model forward?
Finally, I ask an extremely important question:
• How can I progress understanding of the process and experience of perceiving
abstract art?
As I have already noted, I do not stop at simply commenting on the Klein Group
Model but rather I use this as a springboard to impel the further development of my
own theorizing upon the perception of art abstraction. To date, I have considered
two-dimensional artworks in my writing (Hackett 2013, 2016) but in this essay, I
extend my writing into art with a third dimension. Both Krauss’s Klein Group and
my earlier writing envisage the experience of art as being multifarious events. As
this is the case, in much of my research and thinking, I have employed facet theory9
and have considered how the perception of two-dimensional art can be depicted
using a mapping sentence10 and how further understanding of the characteristics of
three-dimensional art can be developed through a partial ordering of these
characteristics.11
To these ends, I have turned to the work of another philosopher, Paul Crowther,
who has written much on phenomenological aspects of art experience and ontology.
Reviewing Crowther’s work led me to evaluate the eight characteristics of abstract art
9I will explore facet theory in considerable detail in this book, at this stage interested readers and
guided to Canter (1985) and Hackett (2014) for initial details about facet theory.
10Much of my research has been into the use of the mapping sentence as a stand-alone research
tool, as a research project management technique and as a therapeutic approach (see Hackett 2014)
11Partial Order Scalogram Analysis, and its potential use within a qualitative data setting, are the
major research analytic procedure I will use towards the end of this book. The use of Partial Order
Scalogram Analysis is dealt with in some depth by Shye (1985) and Shye and Amar (1985), to
which the interested reader is guided). Multidimensional Scalogram Analysis (MSA) is a further
form of analysis used within facet theory research. However, I will not be using this form of data
representation within this essay.

Preface

he proposed (Crowther 2007) which are: Resemblances; Gestural Associations;
Revelations; Novel Environments; Neoteric Conﬁguration; Visual Suggestion;
Spatial/Structures; Fantasy. In Hackett (2016) I applied these eight characteristics to
promote understanding of experiential aspects of two-dimensional abstract art. In this
essay, I extend my research that embodies Crowther’s characteristics into the arena
of three-dimensional art where I will evaluate iamges of the same land art pieces
viewed by Krauss (1979) in her research into the extended visual ﬁeld.12 I will
therefore be attempting to establish how Krauss’ three-dimensional “art-space” can be
understood using a mapping sentence mereology and partial order analysis. I will also
be asking similar questions and use similar procedures and approaches to consider
Crowther’s ontology. However, it must be kept in mind that in this book, I will
develop this understanding of art-space as it exclusively encompasses three-
dimensional works of abstract art.13
Having provided a very terse exposition of my essay, in the next section I offer a
synopsis to the chapters that follow.
Chapter Synopsis
In this book, I provide a structural understanding for how art is perceived within the
space occupied by the artwork: this is a situation and historically located account of
how we understand a speciﬁc form of contemporary art. In Chapter 1, I introduce
readers to the major components of the research that forms the books content.
I provide deﬁnitions of terms that are ambiguous or which I use in a speciﬁc sense.
By the end of this chapter, the reader will understand my reasons for writing this
book. I will also make clear the questions I am attempting to answer.
In Chapter 2 I introduce the main theoretical background that I draw upon in
regards to philosophers and theorists who have written upon the structure of our
understandings and perceptions of abstract three-dimensional art: As already men-
tioned, the two main authors with whom I am concerned are Rosalind Krauss and
Paul Crowther. Krauss’ Klein Group model is discussed14 as is Crowther’s ontology.
In Chapter 3, I consider the use of a mapping sentence to provide an account for
our experiences of non-traditional three-dimensional art. My exposition on this
subject includes my using the mapping sentence to Meaningfully depict three-
12Consequently I consider Krauss’ understanding of how three-dimensional artwork has developed
through the twentieth century to encompass earthworks and other forms of large-scale artefacts.
13Towards the end of this book I will also evaluate and present similarities between my models of
two- and three- dimensional art experiences.
14I review how Krauss’ accounts of the contents of art related visual experience in her consid-
eration of ﬁgure–ground in abstract two-dimensional art leads into her work on the expanded ﬁeld
in site-speciﬁc sculptural works (her foray into three-dimensional abstract art). These are reviewed
to form the basis for the need for my present research.
Preface

dimensional art. I also provide facet analyses of both Rosalind Krauss’ and Paul
Crowther’s theorizing upon three-dimensional art.
Chapter 4 is the longest chapter in this book, in which I present the body of my
research ﬁndings. The results take the form of a partial ordering mereology that I
offer to explain the experience of non-traditional three-dimensional art. The main
results are then presented as a partial ordering of Crowther’s ontology of eight
characteristics, which he has developed to explain the experiential structure of
abstract art.
Chapter 5 is the ﬁnal chapter and in this, I provide a summarized overview of my
research ﬁndings. I also consider how the insight I have offered regarding the
perception and understanding of abstract three-dimensional art is related to earlier
models that I have developed of the same psychological components as they relate
to two-dimensional abstract art. I also consider the directions in which future
research employing qualitative or philosophical facet theory research may proceed.
The shortcomings in the interpretations of the perceptual process by Krauss,
Crowther and others, are used to help formulate a more comprehensive philo-
sophical account for the perceptual process. The book uniquely brings together
structuralist and post-structuralist accounts for artistic perception and understanding
within a conceptual structure from facet theory that is explicated and clariﬁed by the
use of a mapping sentence mereology. This book is the most recent in a series of
books and articles I have written that have addressed how we perceive and
understand abstract ﬁne art using a non-traditional, non-quantitative facet theory
approach to research. This book also exists in conjunction with my art practice. The
art and written works I have created address the same questions and simply employ
different modes of expression to provide answers.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Abstract In any book, the ﬁrst chapter sets the scene for what the reader is going to
encounter as they progress in their reading. This book is no different and in this
introductory chapter, I succinctly establish the main components of the coming essay in
such a manner that, I hope, will reduce later surprises that are potentially confusing and
enhance the reader’s sense of accumulative discovery and knowledge development.
I start by considering the idea of categories of art and art experience including notions
of aesthetics and ﬁgure ground relationships. In order to achieve clarity in my claims I
then go on to deﬁne the major terms that I use including: mapping sentences; ontology;
hermeneutics and hermeneutic consistency; mereology; facet theory in general and in
particular qualitative facet theory and the mapping sentence (as this relates to notions of
a ﬂexible hermeneutically consistent template); three-dimensional abstract art. The
overall aim of this chapter is to prepare the reader for my enquiries into viewers’
experiences when looking at three-dimensional abstract art.

Introduction
Art exists is experienced and may be understood using deﬁnitional categories.
Kendall Walton exempliﬁed this claim, when he stated in his seminal text of 1970,
that: “Paintings and sculptures are to be looked at; sonatas and songs are to be
heard.” (Walton 1970, p. 334). This mundane statement establishes categories of art
modality as undeniable and apparent. Walton then asks to what other categories
artworks can be allocated and the amount to which a discrete modular system of art
category exists and the extent of such a categorial system? For example, Walton
asks about the independence of differing categorial divisions of art typiﬁed in his
text by statements such as: “The issue I am here concerned with is how far critical
questions about works of art can be separated from questions about their histories.”
(Walton 1970, p. 335).

Aesthetics are not the prime concern, per se, of this book. However, aesthetics
have so frequently been cited as a category of experience that deﬁne the art object
or event and therefore require some consideration. A dictionary deﬁnition of the
term aesthetics reveals the word, in its common everyday usage, to be concerned
with the appreciation of beauty. Aesthetics is also to do with the notion of beauty
itself, on the assumption that it is possible for objective beauty to exist outside of an
appreciation of the quality. Thus, beauty is an entity that produces aesthetic plea-
sure when perceived. Indeed, aesthetics is so concerned with the production of
pleasure that aesthetic entities are often contrasted to their more mundane and
prosaic functional counterparts. Whilst such a deﬁnition of aesthetics is instantly
ambiguous or vague, aesthetics is also employed to denote the practices and doc-
trines of a speciﬁc artist or artistic movement. Other uses of the term aesthetics
include the demarcation of the values that are concerned with what constitutes
beauty and its appreciation and ﬁnally aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that
addresses beauty and taste in art.
Remaining within the discipline of philosophy, Shelley (2015) notes how aes-
thetics has been used to designate entities such as objects or events, as things we
hold important or possess value and are cognitive and/or emotional: evaluations;
orientations to the world; psychological experiences. Varieties of responses have
emerged within philosophy to many questions regarding aesthetics. In reference to
the content of this essay for instance, philosophers are in disagreement over whether
an artwork must also be an aesthetic object. Moreover, if aesthetic appreciations are
by deﬁnition perceptual then what are the bases for the cognitive/linguistic reasons
we offer to justify our appreciations?
Furthermore, Shelley (2015) questions if an aesthetic experience is best deﬁned
in terms of representational or phenomenological content. He goes on to note that
during the end of the last century the concept of aesthetics itself came to be
questioned in terms of whether it has any legitimate philosophical purpose.
Moreover, the term aesthetics is only useful in reference to other terms that are
needed to make the conceptual content of aesthetics understandable.
Thus, aesthetics is a descriptive category that has been applied to art in attempts
to clearly and unambiguously identify art events or objects from other events and
objects. In this essay I will explore how categories, when categories are taken
together as a categorial system, may be used to describe our experiences of abstract
three-dimensional art. In the sections below, I consider some of the major
descriptive forms that have been employed when talking about this type of art.
Figure–ground relationships are one such category of art experience that have
applied to two-dimensional abstract art and with which I will commence my review.

Figure and Ground
As I write this book I am sitting in a café in Oxford. It is an obvious point that I
have absolutely no idea what you will be looking at if you looked up from this book
and looked around you. Perhaps you will be looking at the inside of an academic
2

Introduction

library surrounded by a vast array of books upon shelves. It could be that you will
look up and across a coffee table in your house to where your partner sits. I can also
imagine that you are perhaps sitting in a plane bounded on both sides by other
passengers and with the noise of the jet engines accompanying your reading.
Precisely what you see and experience beyond this book is outside my knowing;
but I am able to predict with fair levels of conﬁdence that you will experience what
you are seeing as having both a ﬁgure (or foreground) and ground (or background).
If you still have this book in your line of vision then this may be forming the
foreground and your partner, the video monitors hanging from the bottom of the
baggage lockers above, ﬂight attendants, or the aforementioned library shelves, may
be forming the background.
For a moment, I ask you to imagine you are on the plane reading this book: This
is probably an easy task of imagination for you to accomplish. All is well and you
picture yourself reading however, whilst you are reading the text two ﬂight atten-
dants pushing the drinks trolley intrude into the background of your vision. Try as
you might to hold your focus upon the book, the sound of them asking other
passengers what they would like to drink, coupled with the smell of coffee, forces
you to focus upon the service trolley. The book is still open and visible to you
though you are no longer placing the focus of your attention upon this. What was
the background has now become the focus of your attention and whilst the ﬂight
attendants and their trolley are still physically behind the book, the text no longer
forms your attentional foreground.
In the situation described, there has been an attention driven ﬂip of the ﬁgure to
ground relationship present in your visual ﬁeld. Another perceptual possibility is
that there are now perhaps two forms of ﬁgure and ground: physical (or visual)
foreground and background and simultaneously an attention based foreground and
background made up of the same visual elements of book and trolley but reversed.
For another moment, I now ask you to picture yourself in an art gallery. You are
walking through a rather magniﬁcent collection of Pre-Raphaelites paintings with
their detailed, precise and colourful content. You stop to look at one particularly
ﬁne example of a lady submerged in water with green foliage around her and her
face protruding from the river (Ophelia, by Sir John Everett Millais). The image of
the woman captivates our attention as indeed she is meant to. You spend time
scrutinizing her: the brush strokes, colours, tones, her hair, clothes and especially
her hands. The woman is obviously the foreground (and obviously in this case the
ﬁgure). However, when we concentrate upon her hands do these become the ﬁgure
whilst the woman as a whole is transformed to become the background? I can also
ask this question about her hair and clothes, and to a lesser extent with the less
discrete elements of colour, tone or brushwork. Furthermore, you ﬁnd yourself
concentrating upon an aspect of the foliage, ﬂowers in bloom, petals on the water.
Our focus is again shifted and the foliage becomes the ﬁgure and all else the
ground.
The two examples of the plane and art gallery are similar as both are visual
experiences. The major difference between the two scenarios is the fact that one
embodies real life activities and the other a painted narrative. Figure and ground are

identiﬁed as being pervasive categorial components of ﬁne art and foreground and
background are their universal real-world equivalents. However, when I consider
our understanding of our visual experiences I may ask the question: what is it that
we perceive? What part of what we experience may be categorised as what we see
and what part is our understanding or judgment? Furthermore, which comes ﬁrst,
the vision, from which we select the attention grabbing elements that are related to
our memories and preferences that guide our selective vision, or vice-versa? Put
another way, do external stimuli guide our visual explorations and perhaps cau-
sally1 inﬂuence our perceptual focus, do our motives, experiences and expectations
guide what it is we see, or is it perhaps a combination of these? I have been using
the example of the two-dimensional form of artwork (mainly painting and drawing),
but I could have used a three-dimensional work to illustrate the perceptual process.
We can now take another step further from the act of looking at an actual life
event and consider looking at abstract art. When viewing many forms of abstract
two- or three-dimensional art a clearly identiﬁable ﬁgure in the sense of a person,
object or event is not present, as the perspicuous identiﬁcation of ﬁgure has been
removed. In this situation, do we perceive an array of colours, hues, tonalities or
random shapes and occlusions? If no explicit shape is incorporated, do we form our
own perceptual shapes? What happens when we are forced to abandon all notions
of ﬁgure and ground elements as in the case of artists such as Yves Klein? For
example, his single undifferentiated blue paintings such as “IKB 79” (1959). In art,
ﬁguration is taken to mean that the artist is incorporating forms within his or her
work and that these forms are recognisable.2 In abstraction, we have moved from
identiﬁable form and we have lost physical or visual foreground and background
(in two-dimensional works) and gone are the discretely identiﬁable sculptural or
1If we are asked what it means to cause something, we may initially think about the physical world
in which one physical object hits or bumps into another and causes a reaction in the object being
hit such as damage. We may also think about the instance where warmth may cause us to sweat or
the cold may result in us shivering. These are simple examples of causation but causation has been
thought of in ways that are somewhat different to these common conceptions. For example, if we
resist from stopping something from happening, (i.e., letting it occur) is also a behaviour that may
be understood as causing an outcome. There is little consensus in metaphysical deﬁnitions of
causality although there is a widely agreed bifurcation of causation. Here, notions of causal relata
ambody enquiries into: immanence; individuation and adicity. The alternate branch of causation
research addresses causal relationships (such as the cause and effect relationships I have spoken
about above). This form of research is concerned with: ways in which the connection of causally
related sequences of events may be differentiated; differences between the direction of cause and
effect sequences and the distinguishing of cause from contextual factors. The reader interested in
reading more about causation is guided to: Beebee et al. (2012) and Paul and Hall (2013).
2Figurative art is the contrast of abstract art. Figurative art is art that is representational of amongst
other things, an object, place or setting although abstract art can be seen to be derivative of the real
world but its representation is less literal. Therefore, the term ﬁgurative art is a description of
artwork (usually sculptures, drawings or paintings) that are clearly related to some real object.
These categories may however blur and non-representational art, non-objective art and abstract art
are often used synonymously as the antithetic foil of representative art. It is important to note that
ﬁgurative art does not necessarily embody the human or animal ﬁgure.

monumental features in three-dimensional works: We now perceive something else
or extend the limits of perception of what constitutes our attentional foreground and
background.
This is perhaps a good moment to draw attention to the veridicality of the
statement that in everyday experience ﬁgure and ground are usually equivalent in
terms of their perceptual value and neither is superior or more important than the
other. Often, the ﬁgure or foreground is conceived to be more important than the
background, which plays a supporting role, perhaps because the foreground is the
focus of attention or the nearer and more visually dominant visual stimuli.
However, given the inter-changeability of ﬁgure and ground, either through ones
physical movement of shift of attention, suggests that the same objects or events
may act in either role and thus are in themselves of similar importance or value.
Consequently, what changes or determines ﬁgure from ground is the active per-
ception of the event rather than the actual event. The word perception is being used
here rather than seeing or sensing as perception implies a concurrent understanding
that goes along with the stimuli that are received though our visual sense along
with perhaps an act of imaginative creation.
1.2.1
Figure–Ground and Mapping Sentences
The relationships that visually exist between ﬁgure and ground form the basis of our
ability to perceive both two-dimensional and three-dimensional works of art. On
this understanding, the ﬁgure is that thing, event or state of affairs that constitutes
the foreground in an artwork. On the other hand, the ground is that which is behind
the ﬁgure. This may sound a rather obvious distinction to make but it is worthwhile
stating to achieve clarity regarding this cardinal feature of art. This centrality of
value I am according to ﬁgure and ground is because ﬁgure–ground relationships
form the basis of perspective in paintings and drawings and are what facilitate the
creation of a sense of depth (a sense of reality) within two-dimensional works. In
three-dimensional artworks, ﬁgure and ground are related to the ability to distin-
guish an artwork from its setting and may be linked with visual processes such as
motion parallax that an artist may choose to exploit in order to provide a changing
sense of meaning. In terms of paintings and drawings, if ﬁgure–ground relationships
fail then images do not convey a feeling of being real. In reference to sculptures,
land-art, and other three-dimensional artworks, a lack of what is equivalent to a
ﬁgure–ground relationship, yields the piece of artwork imperceptible.
What I have just said about the categorial distinction between ﬁgure and ground
was relatively uncontroversial until the development in the mid-twentieth century
of the Modernist art movement. Historically, many of the artists who worked under
Modernist understandings of the creative art process, set themselves the task of
creating pure sensation that was not shackled by the conventions or physicality
associated with the real world. Under these notions, the artworks that emerged
possessed uncertain ﬁgure and ground relationships (for example: Abstract

Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock) or canvasses that were painted with a
single colour without the incorporation of form (for instance: Yves Klein). This era
also saw the emergence of land art, happenings, performances, etc., within the
three-dimensional genre of ﬁne art.
When considering these modernist abstractions the question may be asked of
exactly what it is we perceive if there is a lack of ﬁgure and ground or form?
Leading on from this the further question arises as to the meaning that such works
of art have to viewers? Modernism attempts to dismantle and rid art of, what
modernist artists saw as the restrictive strictures of ﬁgure and ground. However, I
may pose the question: is it possible to achieve this end? A major writer, art
historian and art critic who has offered her opinions on the Modernists’ endeavours
is Rosalind Krauss. Krauss proposed a theoretical model, based upon the Klein
Group,3 which she claims provides understanding of ﬁgure–ground relationships in
artworks from the Modernist era, and indeed, in art works from later eras.
In my recent book “Fine art and perceptual neuroscience: ﬁeld of vision and the
painted grid” (Hackett 2013) I directed some of my attention to the Krauss Klein
Group model and I related this model to the philosophical and neuroscientiﬁc
underpinnings associated with perceiving abstract two-dimensional art. I continued
my exploration of the perception of abstract two-dimensional art in my later books:
“Facet theory and the mapping sentence: evolving philosophy, use and application”
(Hackett 2014) and “Psychology and Philosophy of Abstract Art: Neuro-aesthetics,
Perception and Comprehension” (Hackett 2016b). In this present essay, I extend my
discussion of the Klein Group and increase the depth of my critical exposition to
another area in contemporary art. I also re-position the facet theory mapping sen-
tence model for understanding two-dimensional artwork that I have developed in
the above publications. The consequence of these considerations is that I question
Krauss’ model of the expanded ﬁeld in terms of its ability to account for perception
of three-dimensional abstract art and I propose my own structural model in a
mapping sentence format. My intention within the pages of this book is to offer an
account for understanding how we perceive three-dimensional abstract artworks.
The writing in this book is an extension of my research and publications in the area
of perception of art and again I employ a mapping sentence mereology as a means
through which I provide a structural account of the process of perception.
3Later in this book I devote considerable space to consider the Klein Group and how Rosalind
Krauss incorporated its structure within her theorizing. However, it will be useful for the reader if, at
this juncture, if I present an extremely brief description of the Klein Group model. The manner in
which Krauss uses the Klein group is quite speciﬁc and is rooted in the sense of the symmetry of
relationships that exist across the group. Terms that designate the content of interest are written at
the four corners of a square. All possible links between these terms are then considered. The two
pairings between opposite corners are counterpart to each other and the links around the edge of the
square also possess speciﬁc meaning. By specifying the relationships between all possible pairings
of the terms at the corners of the square, it is hoped to achieve a complete understanding of the
content bounded by the square. I will write extensively on the Klein Group later in this book.

Introduction

1.2.2
The Expanded Field
Rosalind Krauss’ phrase ‘sculpture in the expanded ﬁeld’ is of importance in this
essay, largely due to the manner in which the term demonstrates the manner in
which an art critic/theorist of renown has grappled with the changing form of
sculpture in the mid-twentieth century. As well as writing about two-dimensional
art and ﬁgure–ground relationships in art of the modernist era, (as I noted above)
Rosalind Krauss also wrote on the nature of the art object for this genre of
three-dimensional art. Some would call such three-dimensional artworks abstract.
Moreover, as well as paintings from the mid-twentieth century departing from
literal representation other aspects of what used to be thought of as sculptures also
changed. Modernist three-dimensional art and especially that from the 1970s
changed dramatically as did the notion of public art (it should be remembered that
traditionally public art most often consisted of three-dimensional artworks or
sculptures). Such changes in society and its understanding of public art was
accompanied with a reworking of the concept of sculpture itself and the growing
use of the term three-dimensional art.
At this time the notion of land art and environmental based interventions also
came to the fore. This development accelerated the demise of conventional
understandings of sculpture and the notion developed of art or sculpture that existed
within an expanded ﬁeld. The ﬁeld into which art was expanding was varied and
included wilderness locations (Spiral Jetty,4 Lightening Field5) open-air city
museums (Spoleto6) and other alternative locations in which museums exhibited
artworks (Skulptur Projekte Munster7). Artists, for example, Michael Heizer and
Daniel Buren took their interventions into public space in the exhibitions such as
When Attitudes Become Form.8 Christo and Jean-Claude’s wrapped buildings such
as the Reichstag in Berlin and in other of their works, geographical locations such
4In 1970 Robert Smithson created Spiral Jetty, an earthwork on the shore of the Great Salt Lake,
Rozel Point, Utah. The jetty is 460 metres long and 4.6 metres wide and is constructed from salt
crystals, mud and basalt rocks. The jetty forms a clockwise spiral that reaches into the Great Salt
Lake. The degree to which it is visible varies due to the Lake’s water level.
5In 1977 sculptor Walter de Maria created the Lightening Field. This is a land-art work situated
between Quemado and Pie Town, in New Mexico, composed of 400 pointed tip poles made of
stainless steel. De Maria positioned the poles as a grid in a rectangle space of one mile by one
kilometer. The poles are of irregular length to enable the tops of the poles to be on a level plane.
The installation still exists and was renovated in 2012. The installation has become a tourist
attraction run by the Dia Foundation.
6Fifty-three renown sculptors took part in the seminal exhibition located in Spoleto, Italy in 1962.
The artists displayed works around public areas in Spoleo’s Città dei Due Mondi.
7Skulptur Projekte Munster was initiated in 1977 as an outdoor exhibition of sculpture. The
sculpture was not located in a single location or at a single museum, rather, sculptures were
exhibited in different places across the town of Munster. The free exhibition is held every ten years
with the next show being in 2017.
8When Attitudes Become Form was a Post-Minimalist exhibition of American artists that was held
at the Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland in 1969.

as coral reefs were wrapped. These two artists also erected dozens of large gates in
Central Park, questioned the scale and extent of three-dimensional art.9 In contrast
to the traditional permanence of sculptures, many of the above works, as well as
those of other artists such as Gordon Matta-Clark, were temporary in their nature.10
Work by artists such as Richard Long pushed deﬁnitions even further when he
undertook walks in a variety of locations, such as Iceland, in which both the activity
of the walk and a record of the walk, comprised the artwork.11
When a three-dimensional piece of public art is considered in the above context,
the artwork is not limited to being an object of ornament or beauty or even an object
of commemoration, as traditional statues often are. Instead, these works have an
existence of their own that transcends the very speciﬁc object-hood of the tradi-
tional form. This form of artwork involves the artist and the public directly in the
broader
context
of
the
work.
The
site-speciﬁc
nature
of
contemporary
three-dimensional works rail against the conﬁning and enclosing nature of the art
gallery and its institutional character. The artist of such works attempts to establish
meaningful associations between the artwork, its creation and the site of the art-
work. Often these components and their inter-connections have political connota-
tions, which form elements of the artwork itself.
Within these pages, several theoretical perspectives are considered but I draw
most heavily upon the work of art theorist Rosalind Krauss and philosopher Paul
Crowther. In so doing I uniquely assemble an account that calls upon structuralist
and post-structuralist postulations of artistic perception and an understanding that I
make clear through the use of my own theoretical mereology. Above, I have stated
both the form of art that is the focus of my interest and that I will be attempting to
facilitate understanding about how we perceive and experience these types of visual
9Bulgarian installation artists, Christo Vladimirov Javacheff and Jeanne-Claude, created
large-scale environmental artworks. Christo and Jean-Claude created many land-based works or
installations that I could have included in this book. However, I provided three examples to
illustrate the extent and variation in their work. The enormous nature of the work they produced
was spectacular with the aim of making an immediate visual statement. Amongst their creations
were the following examples: The Reichstag in Berlin involved the wrapping of the Reichstag with
almost 100,000 square metres of polypropylene and aluminium. Running Fence involved con-
structing a 5.5 m high fence that ran 40 km through California. The fence was constructed of
fabric stretched between 2050 steel posts and held-up on 145 km of steel cable. The Gates in
Central Park constituted the erection of 7503 gates straddling paths in Central Park, New York
City. Each gate was covered in saffron fabric and were 5 m high.
10In Gordon Matta-Clark’s installation in a house next door to the Museum of Contemporary art in
Chicago, the artist made a series of circular incisions into the walls and the ﬂoors of the house.
11Richard Long has created many pieces of land-art. However, I am referencing Long in this essay
speciﬁcally for works that are based around one of his his walks: he has undertaken these in a
variety of locations. He also constructed pieces as a result of, or as a response to, the environment he
traversed during one of his walks (an example being the 1967 work: A Line Made by Walking
1967). On occasion Long also made sculptures from the materials he found on a walk. He con-
structed these sculptures in the place he found the materials and then recorded these phographically.
He also wrote about, took photographs of and mapped the landscape though which he walked.

Introduction

forms. I will now turn my attention to how scholars have attempted to develop
knowledge of such complex events as perception.
A vast array of academic enquiry has asked the question, how do we understand
the world around us? This may be the most basic of general questions about our
existence that we can ask. In fact, this is such a general and fundamental form of
enquiry that it is impossible to provide a simple, single answer. To provide a
meaningful responses to such a vast domain we may need to focus our concerns
upon more speciﬁc categories of understanding, which are related to the type of
question we are asking or to the area of life into which we are enquiring. I reﬁne my
question therefore to be a slightly more particular inquisition that asks about, ‘how
we are able to achieve understanding of our worlds through the categorisation of
events, situation, phenomena and things, viz.: reality’.
Moreover, is there a single, ‘universal’ set of divisions of reality or are there
multiple categories and are they harmoniously or rancorously collated? This leads
to a series of further questions concerned with the existence or otherwise of
boundaries between and within parts of reality. For example: ‘do these boundaries
between aspects of our experience exist in reality apart from the human perception
or creation of these divisions;’ ‘can reality be classiﬁed or categorised;’ ‘if it is
possible to perceive or form meaningful categories then how should we determine
the lineaments to enabled classiﬁcation and how should we use these categories’? It
is beyond the bounds of this text to explore these questions in detail even though I
will later attempt a categorisation to human perception. In attempting this, I con-
centrate upon the process of categorizing the domain of visual perception rather
than the philosophical underpinnings and justiﬁcations for classiﬁcation per se.
Thus, a realist approach will be adopted in which reality as a whole will be
understood to be divisible into meaningful parts or components.
We continually think about complete events and about the parts of these events.
There are extremely obvious ‘wholes’ with ever-apparent ‘parts’. For example, we
live in a ‘whole’ house or other form of abode, which, in our culture, typically has
functionally distinct rooms or ‘parts’. Other parts of our experiential existences are
similarly divisible totalities but of a more abstract nature. Our lives are the whole
contexts of our existence but we may conceive of these as possessing identiﬁable
sub-components, such as: of being at school, at university, middle age, and
retirement. At breakfast, we may think about the whole of the workday in front of
us and of the differentiable parts of the coming day, such as: the morning meeting, a
lunchtime appointment, and so on. We also think about the things in our lives in
these terms, such as our car and also of the car’s seat, steering wheel and of the
separate componential usages we put the car too, for example: driving to work or
going on holiday.
Thus far in this chapter I have provided a brief sketch of what I will be writing
about in this book. However, before I delve more deeply into the substantive
content of this book I need to provide precise deﬁnitions of some terms both
because these words and phrases are ambiguous and/or not commonly used.

1.3
Deﬁning Terms
In the writing that follows, I will attempt to develop an initial exposition of the
perceptual processes involved when experiencing three-dimensional abstract art.
However, my exploration of these perceptual processes requires the use of precise
terms, which I will now deﬁne.
1.3.1
Ontology
When one speaks about ontology, there are many different deﬁnitions of the term
arising from a variety of academic and professional disciplines.12 If we take the
deﬁnitions of ontology that I list in the footnotes13 a common theme has emerged
around the concept of ontology such that ontology refers in some sense to notions
regarding the fundamental aspects of existence within a speciﬁed context. However,
in this essay I will speciﬁcally use the word ontology to imply the basic or fun-
damental parts of our experiences under the following sense:
Ontology is the study and formal explication of the content of a domain in terms of its more
fundamental or basic categorial components. An ontology may be understood and the
meaning of the ontology revealed at this fundamental level through consideration of more
sub-ordinate, particular or evident categorial components (Adapted from Hackett 2016b).
This is the sense in which I will be using the term ontology, although, in this
essay I need to reﬁne the notion of ontology by adding the preﬁx terms “structured”
and “meta”. By doing this I further delimit my approach to ontology to be one that
embodies ontology as “structured-ontology” and “meta-ontology”. By a structured
ontology what I mean is the presentation of the fundamental units of a concept area
as a categorial ontology within a determinate structural framework. Later on, I will
delve into the nature of this structure, which is called a mapping sentence. Strictly
speaking, in this essay and in my earlier writing about the experience of abstract art,
I have developed and will be developing a meta-ontology for fundamental aspects
of art perception experiences. What I mean by this is that my qualitative ontologies
12The term ontology has a wide variety of slightly different meanings when used by different
disciplines that have each developed precise and speciﬁc understandings for the term ontology as
part of their lexicon and way of thinking. Examples of these different usages include: in philosophy
—ontology is a branch of metaphysics concerned with the nature of being; within logic—ontology
is the set of entities that a given theory assumes beforehand; within information and computer
sciences—ontology is the rigorous designation of existent components (sorts, characteristics) and
their inter-associations.
13I could have proposed even more speciﬁc deﬁnitions for the term ontology. However, the ones I
have listed sufﬁce to illustrate the varied usage of the term.

are ontologies about ontologies: they are theoretical frameworks about ontological
types of experiences rather than necessarily being limited to renderings of speciﬁc
empirically bound experience of a given artwork14: Thus, in this writing I develop a
structured meta ontology for experiences of three-dimensional abstract art.
1.3.2
Hermeneutics and Hermeneutic Consistency
Whether the fundamental components of an experiential ontology are empirical,
conceptual or a mixture of both of these, the meaning of these fundamental units of
a content area requires interpretation in regard of its development and of the
application and meaning such ontology imparts upon a content domain. When one
engages in the interpretation of meaning in terms of a speciﬁc ontology the reader is
undertaking a hermeneutical analysis. The word hermeneutics or hermeneutical
refers to an interpretive methodology that is clearly demonstrated in the research
and writing of Heidegger (2008) and Gadamer (2004).15 When an ontology is
deemed to possess hermeneutic consistency the basic units that have been identiﬁed
as structuring experience, and therefore interpretations, of a content domain per-
form in their roles in a reliable manner.
1.3.3
Mereology16
Mereology is another word that is understood in slightly different ways dependent
upon the discipline within which the concept of mereology is being used (for
example, philosophy, science, logic, mathematics, semantics).17 As with ontology
and hermeneutics, my use of the word mereology will be speciﬁc and to avoid any
possible confusion and misinterpretation I provide a deﬁnition of mereology as
follows:
14I am using meta-ontology in the sense of theory that underlies a generic framework for the
constitution of interpretative consistency of a research domain, whilst not imposing an external
structure to either the content under investigation or to the interpretation itself.
15The writing of both Heidegger and Gadamer displayed considerable concern with knowledge
and truth. The phrase hermeneutic consistency refers to the ability to achieve a coherent expla-
nation of an informational source.
16My account of mereology is largely drawn from those given by Kleinschmidt (2014). She,
in turn attributes much of her writing on mereology to the work of Casati and Varzi (1999),
Simons (1987) and Czleakowski et al. (2013) and I have also turned to these original query
sources.
17For example, within metaphysics mereology is deﬁned as: “… any theory of part hood or
composition.” (Harte 2002, p. 7).

A mereology is: the systematic and explicit investigation and analysis of an ontology and
the understanding of the relationships within this ontology. This understanding is both of
content and of structure in terms of part-to-part, part to whole, part to context, part to
background and part to observation range, relationships.
(Adapted from Hackett 2016a; Koval and Hackett 2015).
Thus, when conducting a mereological analysis one attempts to understand the
relationships between part-to-whole and part-to-part associations and the implica-
tions of these relationships within a categorial system or ontology. However, as
with ontology, in this particular piece of research I am attempting to understand the
more general inter-relationships between part and parts and parts and wholes of an
ontology (the parts and wholes of three-dimensional abstract works of art) and I will
be developing a meta-mereology account about a structured meta-ontology of
abstract
three-dimensional
art
experiences.
On
this
understanding,
a
meta-mereology is a mereology that is concerned with the nature of mereologies
rather than only being the content appropriate to any particular or speciﬁc mere-
ology.18 My interest in developing a structured meta-mereology is because I am
seeking to establish an ontological framework and this focus of interest impels me
to consider the composition of mereological relationships within the meta-ontology.
1.3.4
Context
In my earlier book, (Hackett 2016b) I provided further clariﬁcation of my working
deﬁnitions regarding the importance of context in relation to ontologies and
mereologies. Such a contextual deﬁnition is also needed as this applies to the
writing in this book. Thus:
For a structured ontological/mereological system to exist and to be realised, the context and
background are essential and inherent. Consequent upon this relationship, alterations within
the background and/or context to an ontology/mereology will result in signiﬁcant differ-
ences in the structured ontology/mereology itself (Adapted from Hackett 2016a).
1.3.5
Range of Observations
Furthermore, as well as context being inextricably bound to ontological and
mereological relationships, how we conceive of the ontology/mereology and the
manner in which we gather information about these systems is intricately amal-
gamated with he ontology/mereology itself, and consequently:
18I employ term meta-mereology in the same sense as earlier I used the term meta-ontology.
12

Introduction

In situations in which different forms or ranges of observations are speciﬁed as our means
of gathering information to facilitate our understand of an ontology/mereology these dif-
ferent forms of information will signiﬁcantly alter the content of the structured
ontology/mereology and the nature of knowledge embodied within its structure (Adapted
from Hackett 2016a).
In the essay that follows, I report upon studies, which use facet theory and I seek
recourse to these studies to guide my qualitative and philosophical research.
Employing this approach in relation to the above deﬁnitions means that two further
comments must be made about my use of the terms of ontology and mereology:
“By specifying a structured ontology and providing a mereological account of this ontol-
ogy, I will be stating what is known as a mapping sentence”.
“For the content area of three-dimensional abstract art the mapping sentence I develop will
provide a hermeneutically consistent account and understanding of how we experience
three-dimensional abstract art.”19
Many things in our lives are both whole events and components of larger events
whilst possessing parts or sub-events of their own. Mereology attempts to account
for and provide understanding of wholes and parts or parts and parts and applies to
the domain of material objects or events and to accounts of less tangible things such
as psychological constructs. We may also add new parts to wholes or subtract parts
from wholes: In short, we are greatly concerned with what may be termed ‘part-
hood’ and ‘wholeness’. The context of a mereological account, be this physical,
social or temporal, plays an important role in our understanding of events as wholes
and/or parts and their necessary interrelations and how we interact with these. The
complexity of interaction between entities is also of importance and potential
complexity. The interactive relation in any mereology may be between individual or
greater number of events as reﬂected in the mereological account given. An
example of this is stating that one part is near another involves two parts whilst
specifying a part to be amidst others implies at least three parts and is indeterminate
in number. Mereological accounts also have a focus of intention; be this to explain
or describe.
Many philosophers have employed part and whole analyses (for example,
Aristotle, Leibniz, Kant, Whitehead and Lesniewski) and have developed
part/whole theories. All of these part/whole theories have three formal properties in
common, these similarities are:
1. asymmetric: if a is part of b, b is not a part of a.
2. transitive: if a is a part of b and b is a part of c, then a is a part of c.
3. supplementive: if a is part of b, then there is a part of b that has no common part
with a.
19Thus, facet theory and the mapping sentence may be conceptually deﬁned under the terms
structural meta-ontology and structured meta-mereology. Furthermore, I use these structural
entities in order to develop hermeneutically consistent knowledge about the experience of
three-dimensional abstract art.
1.3
Deﬁning Terms
13

in addition, these basic relationships may be extended to include the following
terms:
4. ingredient: a is the ingredient of b if a is part of b or a is b.
5. overlap: a overlaps b, and vice versa, if something has a common ingredient.
6. disjoint: a and b are disjoint if they do not overlap.
7. Identicality: if a and b have the same parts they are identical.
When thinking about the above principles within an everyday context rather than
in the above formal terms, a part is usually thought of as a functionally or mate-
rialistically distinct quality or quantity and is a part in terms of its relationship to a
functional or perceptual whole. For example, the parts of a car are materially
coherent functional units in respect of the car as a whole. Social interactions may
also be seen to possess certain functional or perceptually distinct parts regarding the
functionality of an interaction in its entirety. Integral wholes can usually be divided
into parts of a closed or complete systemic whole. When this is not the case, the
parts that have been collected together may be arbitrary summations of abstract or
discretionary units.
Having stated the above formal requirements of a mereological system some
additional caveats must be added. For example, some parts may be temporal in
nature and not always present in a particular whole. An example is, an introduction
is part of a social interaction that is temporal. Other parts are essential and must
always be present in an extant whole. Blood, for example is a necessary part of a
living human being. Therefore, in deﬁning any ‘thing’ we necessarily have to take
into consideration the whole object or event, its parts and the nature of these parts to
other parts and to the whole. Essentiality, temporality and the normality of the part
based deﬁnition will also need to be addressed.
When we look at a three-dimensional work of abstract art we may be seen to be
engaging in a mereological expedition. What meets our senses is a practically
two-dimensional image of an object that possesses any selection of the character-
istics of: shape, location, tonality, shadow, hue, colour, form, texture, and other
qualities. From this sensed data, we construe a work of art and perhaps understand
this as an aesthetic experience. The experiencing of two-dimensional art is essen-
tially different from real world sensations as we have to create depth, or the artist has
to imply depth, where none exists. In the real world, we receive cues from the
environment regarding the relative depth positions of ‘things’ within our visual
plane. In a painting or drawing the three-dimensional cues such as motion parallax20
20Motion parallax is a monocular depth cue, a cue which operates with a single eye rather than
both of the eyes together. Motion parallax comes about when we view objects that are at different
distances from us and where we are aware that the closer objects appear to be moving faster than
objects that are further away from us. Motion parallax is one form of more general parallax which
is an effect the apparent difference in position when we look at an object from slightly different
positions, such as the positional difference between the right and left eye.
14

and the information from retinal disparity21 are absent. Many of the everyday cues
we employ to assess depth are however present in a two-dimensional projection and
the artist exploits these to create the illusion of depth. For instance, overlapping
objects, perspective and the relative size of objects.
In this initial chapter, I have thus far deﬁned some background aspects of our
perception and understanding of three-dimensional abstract art. In the sections
below, I turn the process of circumscribing the terms to the theoretical and research
approaches I will be employing starting with facet theory.
1.4
Facet Theory
Facet theory is an approach to research in the social sciences. Since its inception in
the work of Louis Guttman in the mid twentieth century, facet theory has become
an established approach within social science research. In addition, over the past
70 years a wide range of research publications have appeared operating within the
theoretical and analytic rubric of facet theory and for the last two decades a biennial
international conference has been held devoted to facet theory research.
When using a facet theory approach, an implicit aim of the research so generated
is bringing together in a formal and clearly stated manner the content area that is
being investigated along with data analysis procedures that may be use to inves-
tigate this content. Integrating the explicit design of research content and its sub-
sequent analysis allows for the construction of theory pertaining to the content area
and thus for the development of meaningful appraisal of complex research areas.
Using a mapping sentence (MS) which is the main tool of facet theory
research, allows the clear explication of an area of research content. In a MS all of
the pertinent variables (facets) associated with the speciﬁc subject matter of the
research study are speciﬁed in the form of a natural sentence. In an MS facets are
arranged to demonstrate how facets are theoretically thought relate to each other.
Sub-levels of facets are deﬁned in such a way as to capture the relationships of
research variables (facets) to each other and the overall research domain.
Background variables are also stated in a MS along with a speciﬁed range over
which observations will be made to test the veracity of the structural hypotheses
implicit in a MS. Furthermore, by using a MS the researcher is able to select
variables that appropriately address an area of content.
In order to interrogate the structural hypotheses that are present in a MS, data
analysis procedures are employed, such as Smallest Space Analysis (SSA),
Multidimensional Scalogram Analysis (MSA) and Partial Order Scalogram
21Retinal disparity is a stereoscopic aid to depth perception also known as stereopsis (I brieﬂy
commented upon this in the previous footnote on parallax). Retinal disparity is the distance
between the eyes which causes two slightly different images to be transferred to the cortex and
which allows for creation of binocular vision.

Analysis by base Coordinates (POSAC).22 In SSA, the structural interrogation of
the content area of interest (the variables that have been included in the MS and
their interrelationships) is analysed. In SSA, data is represented geometrically (as
partitioned regions) in a concept-space related to the speciﬁc research domain.
Respondents may also be investigated in terms of their proﬁle of facet related scores
using POSAC.
This description is of facet theory as a quantitative form of research that pos-
sesses the ability to enable the design of instruments and procedures to investigate
of a research area. However, in the current research I have utilized a more quali-
tative or philosophical format of facet theory driven research. In the next section, I
provide details of this type of facet theory research.
1.5
Qualitative Facet Theory and the Mapping Sentence
In this brief essay, I propose a more qualitative form of facet theory research23
claiming this to reside in philosophical conceptions of meta-ontology and
meta-mereology. I have already noted that Louis Guttman originated facet theory
with an implicit perspective that holds human activities may be understood in terms
of the speciﬁed activity’s discrete components24 (Guttman 1947, also see Levy
1994). For the last three decades, I have used traditional quantitative facet theory
and over the last few years, I have started to use facet theory with qualitative data
and as a philosophical orientation to humanities and social science forms of
research.25 Later in this essay, I assess the utility of adopting facet theory, and its
major instrument the mapping sentence, in an attempt to understand perceptions of
artwork within a qualitative and philosophical frame of mind.
Traditional facet theory makes cardinal use of the mapping sentence as a tool to
establish research design, to state hypotheses and to allow the meaningful inter-
pretation of analysed data. In my qualitative and philosophical variant of facet
22Facet theory has traditionally been based in quantitative research approaches using the statistical
analyses I list above (see, for instance: Borg and Shye 1995; Canter 1985a, b; Shye 1978; Shye
and Amar 1985; Shye and Elizur 1994). In this research I will be using SSA, POSA but not MSA.
23In facet theory the term qualitative has been used to mean a qualitatively arranged facet rather
than a linear or quantitatively ordered facet: This is not the sense of the word that I will employ.
I use qualitative to imply rich observational, non-numerical information. I also use qualitative in
reference to the employment of facet theory to interrogate one individual person's opinion.
Subsequently I analyse data to establish reliable and valid interpretative hermeneutics.
24Adopting a facet approach also possesses the implication that knowledge that arises from the
social sciences and humanities may best be understood in terms of such categorial understandings.
25I have carried-out qualitative analyses of speciﬁc research domains using mapping sentences as a
framework for the conception and design of research projects. I have then progressed by analysing
qualitative and conceptual data within a facet theory mind-set in order to facilitate theory devel-
opment. This has required me to use facet theory as a philosophical perspective that I have taken
when viewing the subject matter of my research into human behaviour (Hackett 2013, 2014).
16

Introduction

theory I too use the mapping sentence to facilitate data collection and as a
framework for data analysis.26 The importance of the mapping sentence is stressed
by Canter (1985b) when he states: “… a piece of facet research is a process of
reﬁnement, elaboration and validation of a mapping sentence.” (p. 266). In this
essay, the mapping sentence will form a series of hypotheses regarding the identity
of and relationships between the pertinent components that enable us to understand
abstract three-dimensional art. Furthermore, the mapping sentence will be used as a
structural meta-ontology and the inter-relationships present in the mapping sen-
tence’s components are a structured meta-mereology.27
1.5.1
Examples of Qualitative Mapping Sentences
In my earlier writing, I have used mapping sentences to clarify the structure of
metaphysical ontologies by Aristotle (Hackett 2014) and Lowe, (Hackett 2016b). In
developing mapping sentences for these two ontologies I have sought to illustrate
the usefulness of the mapping sentence as a non-numerically based facet theory
approach. In part, this utility is derived from the conceptual rigor that the mapping
sentence has leant to my investigation of Aristotle’s Categories (see, Aristotle and
Ackrill 1975)28 in which the mapping sentence forms a structural ontology and
suggests a possible mereology for his Categories. By suggesting a possible mere-
ological arrangement of the Categories, I uniquely evoke relationships between the
Categories parts-to-parts and parts-to-whole in such a manner that proposes further
explorations of Aristotle’s ontology.
It is useful at this point for me to describe in slightly more detail my mapping
sentence for Aristotle’s Categories as this will not only acquaint readers with how I
have used the mapping sentence in this instance, but will also provide under-
standing
as
to
how
mapping
sentences
are
used
in
a
general
sense.
The “Categories” mapping sentence commences by specifying the subject of the
mapping, in this case, this is written as person (x) meaning a particular individual
26A mapping sentence is a formal statement of a research domain which includes the respondents,
sub-categories of the research content along with the range over which observations will be made,
in the structure of a sentence written in normal prose.
27As I stated in Hackett (2016a) the mapping sentence is a mereology and forms an artworks’
compositional identity, where composition is the relation between a whole and its speciﬁc parts,
and where these parts of the composition form the whole of the artwork and where the whole
artwork is nothing more than its compositional parts: the whole artwork is its compositional parts
and the compositional parts may only be understood within the whole artwork (also see, Cotnoir
and Baxter 2014). It must also be remembered that both the mapping sentence and the artwork
possess compositional elements that include context, materials, history, etc.
28Aristotle’s categories are: 1: Substance (οὐσία); 2: Quantity (ποσόν); 3: Quality (ποιόν); 4:
Relation (πρός); 5: Place (ποῦ); 6: Time (πότε); 7: Being-in-a-position (κεῖσθαι); 8: Having (ἔχειν);
9: Action (ποιεῖν); 10: Affection (πάσχειν). From these Categories I developed a mapping sentence
for Aristotle’s categorial system (Hackett 2014).
1.5
Qualitative Facet Theory and the Mapping Sentence

who is reading the mapping sentence and is the subject of this exposition. I chose to
focus the mapping sentence upon the individual reading the Categories, although I
could have chosen a different focus such as Atistotle, as writer of the Categories.
What then follows in any mapping sentence is a listing of the facets that designate
the content of interest to the research. Facets are the major subdivisions of the
research area and facets are themselves divided into their extant components. The
facets are positioned in a logical order and linguistically connected to read as a
sentence that approximates normal language. In the case of my mapping sentence
for Aristotle’s Categories, his ten categories are arranged in a way that to me made
sense and sub-categories of facets (elements) speciﬁed.
Thus, the sentence continued by stating that the individual perceives the given
{primary} or {secondary} substance, in terms of its, {continuous} or {discrete}
quantity, and its, {habitual and dispositional} or {natural capabilities and inca-
pabilities} or {affections and affective} or {shape} quality, which may be in either,
{isolated} or {interacting} relation, in a given, {near to} or {far from} place
relative location, and {past} or {present} or {future} time relative to extrinsic
events, whilst having, {their clothes} or {ornaments} or {possessions} whilst the
action of the power a substance, {upon something else} or {within itself} is
associated with, being in a position of {positive} or {negative} change, and being
the recipient of a given, affection, {upon the self}.
As with all mapping sentences, the above mapping sentence should be read as a
regular sentence. The emboldened words or phrases are the facet names and the
bracketed words and phrases in italics are the facet elements. If the sentence is read
through multiple times, where on each reading one single element (different on each
reading) is read from each facet then eventually the readings will have encompassed
all possible element combinations and will have totally represented the domain of
interest.
One ﬁnal facet has yet to be introduced and that is a facet of range. The range
facet speciﬁes the evaluative criteria that will be used in the assessment of the
content area. The range appears at the end of each reading of the sentence possesses
a consistent although often different format for each speciﬁc mapping sentence. In
the present mapping sentence where the content area is Aristotle’s Categories, the
range speciﬁed at the end of the sentence is: by which the reader understands their
being from: a, {higher} to {lower} extent.
In Hackett (2016b) I also discussed E.J. Lowe’s contemporary four-category
ontology (Lowe 2007) and I suggested an ontological and mereological structure
for this, again in the form of a mapping sentence.29 As I have described the general
structure of mapping sentences and how mapping sentences are able to account for
a content domain I will not repeat this exposition. Instead, I will simply provide
29Lowe’s ontology has appeared in several slightly varied iterations which Lowe portrayed as an
ontological square. Lowe’s ontology embodies the notion that the world may be understood as
comprising three distinct types of objects, two kinds of events, two modes and three attributes.
Lowe settled with this structure as he believes that this four-category ontology provides “a
uniquely satisfactory metaphysical foundation for the natural sciences” (Lowe 2007, p. 16).
18

Introduction

details of my mapping sentence mereology for Lowe’s four-category ontology. The
ﬁrst part of this mapping is the same as for Aristotle in that the subject is speciﬁed
as being person (x). The sentence continues: understands the world to exist in terms
of kinds that are: {characterized by attributes} or {instantiated by objects} and
objects that are {characterized by mode} or {instantiated by kinds} or {exempliﬁed
by attributes} and modes that are {characterized by attributes} or {instantiated by
objects} and attributes that are {characterized by kinds} or {instantiated by
modes} or {exempliﬁed by objects} where this ontology accounts for basic exis-
tence to a {lesser} to {greater} extent. In this sentence, I am using the same
bracketing, italicizing and emboldening convention as in the Categories mapping
sentence.
The mapping sentences for Aristotle’s ontology and Lowe’s ontology both
provide an unambiguous rendering of the conceptions of the basics of existence as
these have been proposed by these two philosophers. My use of mapping sentences
to model these two ontologies uniquely provide accounts of the structure of the
ontologies along with an interpretation of the possible inter-relationships between
the elements of Lowe’s and Aristotle’s ontologies thus rendering mereological
statements about the ontologies. In making explicit their mereological arrange-
ments, both of the two mapping sentences emphasise the reader’s active and pur-
poseful role in understanding the ontology whilst requiring a researcher to consider
the nature of the context of their ontological evaluation and background features
that may affect its content.
In this chapter, I have proposed expositions and deﬁnitions of a variety of
concepts that run centrally throughout this book. At various points in the chapter, I
have applied these general statements to the topic of two- and three-dimensional
abstract art and prepared the reader for the research I present in the rest of this book.
1.6
Conclusions
The purpose of this introductory chapter has been to raise the readers’ awareness of
the subject matter of this essay and to offer unambiguous deﬁnitions of the main
components of this research. During the chapter I have suggested that better
understanding of a content domain may come about from sub-dividing a domain
into pertinent and basic categories: The development of ontological and mereo-
logical structures can avail understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.
I then suggested that facet theory and the mapping sentence may usefully be
considered as a structured meta-ontology/meta-mereology and that in doing this
these approaches have achieved a category-based epistemological exposition of
many research areas under a quantitative research rubric.
I have noted that the initial development of facet theory was as a quantitative
research approach; I then cited my own use of the approach in support of facet
theory as a more qualitative and philosophical research orientation. More speciﬁ-
cally, I have claimed that my use of a mapping sentence as a philosophical outlook

Qualitative Facet Theory and the Mapping Sentence
19

has enabled further understanding to be produced in the form of a mapping sen-
tence mereology. I have conducted this type of research for both Aristotle’s
Categories and Lowe’s four-category ontology. I propose that the mapping
sentence I will produce in this research has the potential to form a hermeneutically
consistent though ﬂexible structural ontology/structural mereology that can enable
greater appreciation of how we understand three-dimensional abstract art. In chapter
two, I consider the work of scholars who have attempted to understand how we
perceive abstract art.

Chapter 2
Sensing the Art Object
Abstract Having outlined the scope and terms of reference for this book in chapter
one, in the second chapter of my essay I brieﬂy review the work of Rosalind Krauss
and Paul Crowther. Both of these scholars have addressed a similar series of
questions and subject matter in their research, namely, both have written about how
we perceive and understand three-dimensional art. In reviewing Crowther and
Krauss’ published work I attempt to illustrate the different perspectives each has
taken in their research in this area. Krauss has considered the expanded ﬁeld in
which modernist three-dimensional artwork resides and of which it is an intimate
part. She offers a Klein Group model to account for the structural composition of
the three-dimensional artwork. Crowther on the other hand addresses the onto-
logical nature of abstract three-dimensional art. He proposes eight distinct onto-
logical elements in his theoretical depiction of this content domain. Both of these
approaches are extremely germane to my research and I use the characteristics of
Crowther and Krauss’ research to set the scene for my own theorizing on this
subject in the form of a structural mereological/ontological account, which I pro-
pose and discuss in subsequent chapters.

In this second chapter, I provide details of the work of two philosophers, each of
whom has taken a distinctive approach in their attempts to better understand the act
of perceiving in general and more speciﬁcally, they have written on how we per-

and Paul Crowther.1 I could have made an argument for the selection of other
authors to review. However both of the chosen writers have conducted research and
out of their enquiries they have each developed a coherent model for the art per-
ceptual process: my aim is also to develop such a model. As such this scholarship
lends itself to being reviewed in my writing and forming a starting point in my
model’s development. I therefore brieﬂy present a review of writing by Krauss and
Crowther in order to set the scene for my own prognostications upon the experi-
ential
structure
of
perception
as
this
applies
to
our
understanding
of
three-dimensional abstract art.
Discussing and evaluating art whilst trying to bring greater levels of under-
standing and meaning to those who are looking at works of art is a task that many
art critics and art theorists attempt to do in their writing. The process of art criticism
has an ancient pedigree and has been practiced by philosophers and others from
many different eras including such luminaries as Plato and Saint Augustine.
However, it was not until the eighteenth century that art criticism emerged as a
profession.2 Art critics may also attempt to achieve a coherent balanced and rea-
sonable critique of a given work. These endeavours often seek recourse to placing
an artwork within a social, cultural, historical, economic or other context. Indeed,
the writing of academic and professional theorist forms a tapestry of text that offers
an exemplary understanding of the process of historical art creation.3
There have been many statements made about the role of the art critic and what
critics should attempt to achieve in their writing and whether or not they are
successful in meeting their aims. Typically, the art critic does not approach the
artwork from a perspective of hands-on practice but rather they meet the art object
or event as the master of art theory and of art history. They may impart passion in
their writing about art by bringing their verve together with an understanding of
technique and a wider sense of the art scene. Furthermore, the comparison of
contemporary art works with older art enables the critic to proffer analytical rather
than judgemental statements. However, the art critic can also be understood as part
of the art-system (a system embedded within a broader social context) along with,
other individuals, groups and institutions, such as: other artists, gallery owners and
museum curators. Art critics can be identiﬁed as being that part of the art-system
that bestows authenticity upon a piece of artwork: It can be claimed that it is the
1The two authors have both produced a great deal of writing that is relevant to the current essay
and which I could have included in my writing. However, my choice will be extremely focused
upon the topic of this book: abstract three-dimensional ﬁne art. Therefore, I will concentrate
exclusively upon the selected texts of: Krauss (1979, 1986) and Crowther (2007).
2It is not part of the remit of the present book to consider the history and practice of art criticism.
However, other authors have performed these tasks such as: Feldman (1994) and Houston (2012).
3This is nowhere better illustrated than in Harrison and Woods three texts that together present
important art writing that covers the era of 1648 up until 2000 (the three books each take one
historical era: 1648–1815 (Harrison et al. 2001) 1815–1900 (Harrison et al. 1998) and 1900–2000
(Harrison and Wood 2002).

critic that makes a piece of an artist’s work art and communicates this authenticity
to the embodying social system. If the critic does indeed posses this power, it places
him or her in a potentially uncomfortable dialogue with the living artist as the critic
can confer aesthetical appreciation upon the artist.
One art critic who exempliﬁes this role, a role in which the critic communicates
authenticity to the broader society, was José Ortega y Gasset (1883–1955). The art
genre of modernism, is at the centre of my writing in this book and as an essayist,
philosopher and a lover of modernism, Gasset wrote widely about this genre of art
and about the broader category of non-representational art. Gasset4 ﬁlled the role of
the critic as a person who validates the work of art when he noted how most
non-representational art lacked recognizable human form and went on in his essays
to attempt to validate and make this new genre of art open to the understanding of
the wider public.

Rosalind Krauss
Rosalind Krauss is an art critic and theorist working at Columbia University. Krauss
went Wellesley College and later Harvard University’s for her Ph.D. in the
Department of Fine Arts. Here she wrote her dissertation on the work of David
Smith publishing this as a book entitled Terminal Iron Works. Her relationship to
the content of this book is especially pertinent as she is best known for her
scholarship on twentieth-century art with particular reference to modernism and
minimalism.
An illustration of her relevance is demonstrated in Krauss’ writings about artists
like: Donald Judd, Jackson Pollock, Giacometti, Rodin, Brancusi, Robert Morris,
Cindy Sherman, Sol LeWitt, Richard Serra to name but a few.5 Krauss has con-
tributed essays to many prestigious journals and was associate editor of Artforum
where she has employed the works of scholars not traditionally associated with the
arts to inform understanding of modernist art production.6 As well as writing about
art she has also curated a large number art exhibitions at leading museums. Among
her academic appointments have been those at: MIT; Princeton; CUNY and
Columbia University. Additionally, Krauss has received numerous academic
awards and plaudits.
4See for example: originally in Spanish as, “La deshumanización del Arte e Ideas sobre la novela”
(1925) republished in English as, The Dehumanisation of Art (1968).
5In addition to authoring studies about individual artists, Krauss has also written about broader
aspects of art practice, in for instance: Sense and Sensibility: Reﬂections on Post ’60s Sculpture;
Grids, You Say; and Sculpture in the Expanded Field.
6Examples of such theorists include: Jacques Derrida; Jacques Lacan; Jean-Francois Lyotard;
Maurice Mareau-Ponty; Ferdinand de Saussure, and others.
2.1
Introduction
25

After leaving Artforum Krauss co-founded October where she remains editor to
this day: both journals provide a critical and theoretical outlook upon artwork from
the same period covered in this book. Krauss’ association with October is of
particular signiﬁcance as when it was developed, October placed the notions of the
French post-structuralist philosophers and theorists central within its ethos.7 Krauss
has authored a number of articles and books that are of particular pertinence to my
research, most notably, her collection of essays from 1985: The Originality of the
Avant-Garde and Other Modernist Myths.
I also take an approach that is similar to Krauss as I draw upon many dimensions
in the development of my model where she drew upon the historical and theoretical
dimensions of art along with aspects of the artworks’ content.8 Furthermore, in her
writing Krauss has addressed features that may be associated with the appreciation
of modernist art such as the absence of apparent form, imitation, lampoon and
mimicry and unconscious visual elements that may be associated with an artwork.
Krauss’ interpretations attempt to decode temporary and ﬂeeting components of
vision-based and corporal sensory experience whilst linguistically accounting for
these.
As an art academic, Rosalind Krauss has proffered understandings of art through
reference to external entities and phenomena. One of the constructs that Krauss has
found recourse to on multiple occasions is a theoretical model that was developed in
structuralist theory called the Klein group. Krauss’s writing that employed the Klein
group addresses both two-dimensional artwork in, The Optical Unconscious
(Krauss 1994)9 and three-dimensional art, originally in her article, Structure in the
Expanded Field (Krauss 1979) which she then elaborates upon in her more recent
chapter, Fat Chance (2010b). In the sections that follow I will review Krauss’s
writing in these main documents. In this writing Krauss addresses two related
concepts from within modernist art, the: expanded ﬁeld in sculpture; the ﬁgure–
ground relationship from painting and drawing (concepts that I introduced in the
previous chapter). I will now brieﬂy articulate the content of these two concepts as
Krauss understood these and adapted them within her Klein groups, as this will
assist understanding of subsequent passages.
7Writers in October included Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault and within the journal Krauss
published scholarly articles on: deconstructionist theory; post-structuralist art theory; postmod-
ernism; psychoanalysis; Feminism.
8Krauss’ concern is broader than mine in that she has considered the emergence of photography as
ﬁne art as this developed at the same time and in a similar way to modernist painting. Within this
context, Krauss also concentrates on the role of various aspects of ﬁne art that act as signs to the
work’s location and signiﬁcance in a social context.
9I devoted considerable time considering Krauss’ understanding of the two-dimensional work of
art in my earlier book (Hackett 2016). In this current text I will only brieﬂy mention Krauss’
theorizing as this applies to two-dimensional art-space as this enables me to introduce my writing
on abstract three-dimensional art. The reader interested in two-dimensional forms of abstract art is
guided to my earlier book.

Sensing the Art Object

As I progress through this book I will develop a series of mapping sentences for
speciﬁc types of artwork. I proffer a mapping sentence below as a statement of the
components of Krauss’ model for two-dimensional art (a form of ontological
account if you will). As this chapter progresses I will both expand understanding
about her writing on this subject and transition into the subject matter of this book,
three-dimensional abstract art, as Krauss wrote on this subject. Ontologies are
concerned with the basics of existence and I use the term ontology as a speciﬁcation
of the basic units involved in the perception of art. Mapping sentences are onto-
logical devices that I have used in earlier research as templates that have enabled
greater understanding of our experiences of abstract art: I use mapping sentences as
ontologies in order to guide my research into the content domain of art
experience.10
Of the mapping sentences I have developed the one that is most pertinent to this
current research is the mapping sentence I originated to qualitatively and philo-
sophically explore painting and drawing that is non-literal or non-ﬁgurative in form
(see, Hackett 2016).11 In facet theory research, mapping sentences clearly specify
the important components of an area of research along with the range over which
observations or analyses will be made. In Fig. 2.1 I propose a mapping sentence for
Krauss’ Klein group for perceiving Two-dimensional abstract art. The mapping
sentence focusses upon attempting to answer the question, how do we perceive this
form of art image? It attempts to offer an answer by comprehensively and
exhaustively specifying the elements of an abstract painting, drawing, etc., that an

artist may manipulate when creating the work and which the person perceiving the
artwork may employ in their appreciation.
To
brieﬂy
recap,
Figure–ground
is
an
explanatory
term
from
within
two-dimensional art theory in which the subject matter of a traditional painting or
drawing is identiﬁed as the ﬁgure and the backdrop to the work as its ground.
Typically, in traditional art the ﬁgure is just that, the ﬁgure of a person. However,
the ﬁgure may be identiﬁed in a broader sense as an animal, a plant, a vase, a car, a
train, a house, a lake and even as a geometric shape or other form that constitutes
the foreground focus of an artwork. The ground is self-explanatory: it is the
background or the supporting image (or neutrality) ‘behind’ a ﬁgure. The dynamic
between ﬁgure and ground is of concern to all forms of two-dimensional art but this
concern assumed an enormity with Modernist and other non-representational forms
of art. The coming to prominence of issues associated with the ﬁgure–ground
relationship in Modernist art was due to their often being no easily identiﬁable
ﬁgure in an artwork of this genre.
Perhaps the most extreme example of the questioning of ﬁgure–ground rela-
tionships undertaken by an artist from this genre of painting is that by Ives Klein. In
many of his paintings the canvasses are painted all over with an essentially undif-
ferentiated single colour. This raises the question of what ‘it’ is a painting of, what
exactly are we looking at and what is the ﬁgure, what is the ground, and do these
terms even apply in this context? I will return to ﬁgure–ground relationships at many
times during the course of this essay. Krauss used a Klein Group to model her
understanding of two-dimensional art and she employed this theoretical structure to
depict the relationship of ﬁgure to ground in abstract art. In the next section of this
chapter, I introduce readers to the concepts inherent in the Klein group.
2.2.1
The Klein Group
Krauss drew inspiration for using a structuralist/structural model to depict the
experiences associated with viewing art from the geometric structure developed in
the late nineteenth century by Felix Klein called the Klein Group. Krauss states how
through using the Klein Group she explicates the process of ﬁgure–ground per-
ception and thus achieves understanding of the perception of modernist art by
referencing understanding to the ﬁgure and ground relationships that are present in
a piece of abstract art. Before I continue to elaborate upon Krauss’ claims in respect
to the utility of the Klein group in modelling experiences of abstract art, it is useful
to have a fundamental understanding of the Klein Group itself. The Klein group,
originates from within mathematics.12 A description of the Klein group is that it is
a: graphical depiction of the cross-product arrangement of n variables each with z
12As a mathematical concept the Klein group requires the understanding of complex mathematical
terms, which Kraus does not describe or expand upon in her usage of the model.
28

components. In Krauss’ model there are 2 variables each with 2 components and
she arranges these pictorially within a Cayley table13 which she terms the Klein
Group.14
The Klein group exists under a variety of names each of which incorporates a
subtle variation. For example, the Klein group is also known as the semiotic square
or rectangle, the Greimas square or rectangle and the Klein four-group. The
two-by-two chi square table is another not too distant relation. All of these ‘squares’
are tools that are used to diagrammatically represent the relationships between
variables, semiotic signs, etc. Krauss places great emphasis on the structure and
explanatory power of the Klein group and I will attempt to elucidate this inﬂuence
through brieﬂy considering these “squares”. I commence by presenting the Greimas
or semiotic square, which was developed from Aristotle’s square of opposition by
Algirdas Greimas in 1966 (Greimas 1984). Greimas originated his semiotic square
in order to analyse relationships between semiotic signs in a way that would reveal
meaning.
The fundamental idea behind the Greimas square is to extend an ontological
system by classify a concept by oppositing polar opposites. For example: girl–boy,
happy–sad. Taking the example of the oppositional concepts of boy and girl, these
are labelled S1 and S2 respectively and two other concepts are then entered into the
square as *S1 and *S2. These are contradictions respectively of S1 and S2 and
are thus not-girl and not-boy. A series of relationships therefore exists between the
four concepts that may be written as follows:
The original opposition: S1 and S2 (girl and boy).
Contradictions: S1 and *S1, S2 and *S2 (girl and not-girl, boy and not-boy).
Complimentarity: S1 and *S2, S2 and *S1 (girl and not-boy, boy and not-girl).
Arising out of the relationships within the semiotic square the following com-
pound concepts include the following:
S1 and S2 (girl and boy = hermaphrodite).
Neither S1 or S2 (neither girl or boy = asexual).
Thus, the Greimas square may be summarized as being formed through the
relationship between the opposition of two contrary terms along an axis ‘S’. In this
binary construction S1 is an assertion or positive construct whilst S2 is the opposing
form of this construct. A second bi-polar opposition is present in the square formed
along a separate axis ‘*S’. Here *S1 and *S2 are respectively the negations of
S1 and S2. *S1 is termed the complex term, and *S2 the neutral term. In the
arrangement of these 4 terms in the square format each element is connected along
each axis with its difference as deﬁned by the content of the square and where the
square represents an assembly of logical possibilities.
13The eponymous Cayley Table, developed by Arthur Cayley, is a depiction of a ﬁnite group of
variables arranging in a square table that shows all possible products of the elements of the group.
14Kraus’ Klein Group four model is the simplest format of presentation of group elements.
2.2
Rosalind Krauss
29

In practice it has been found that attempting to ﬁt terms to the Greimas square is
often not a simple task but is one that can provoke deeper thinking about the
concept that is under enquiry; this is most deﬁnitely part of the function that Krauss
sees the Klein group as fulﬁlling. There are other more complex interpretations and
understandings present in the Greimas square that I will not delve into here as the
above description serves to explain the basics of the square at a rudimentary level.
The above description is also adequate to enable an appreciation of how Rosalind
employed her, analogously structured Klein group.
The use of negative expressions to make a point is common place outside of the
square structures noted above. For example, litotes are understatements that are
ﬁgures of speech used to achieve rhetorical ends. The usual way litotes are for-
matted is as a double negative in which a meaning, pleasure for example, is not
expressed but rather a negative phrased statement is negated. For instance: ‘this is
not unpleasant’. The deliberate emphasis of the understatement, including the use of
intonation, is employed in a litote to make a point.15 However, it is at least inter-
esting to note that because of their imprecion double negative statements are weaker
than simple positive statements. An example will illustrate this. If I state that It’s not
the case that I am not ill or I state I am ill, the former statement is weaker than the
latter. This is because the latter requires the proof of my illness, whereas the former
necessitates a proof that my being ill would not be contradictory to my current state.
Moreover, the double negation is more open to confusion and misinterpretation.
I mentioned earlier that Rosalind Krauss has written extensively about the nature of
ﬁgure–ground relationships in two-dimensional ﬁne-artworks and that she has
developed a graphical Klein group model to account for ﬁgure–ground perception.
Krauss draws her Klein group model as a square “Hasse diagram”16 and as with all
instances of this graphic words are written at each corner to deﬁne the content-space
captured by the diagram. Following the logic for the Gremais square the words Krauss
placed at each corner were: ground; ﬁgure; not-ﬁgure; not-ground.17 The model as
proposed by Krauss systematically presents a limited number of pole-pairings each of
which Krauss associates with a given resolution within artistic practices.18
15The use of double negation also occurs in propositional logic, where double negative terms may
be added without changing a propositions meaning. A biconditional statement is an equivalence
relation as on any occasion in which “not, not A” (¬¬A) occurs in a well-formed formula, under
classical logic double negation may be replaced with the simple positive term “A” without altering
the truth or meaning of the well formed formula.
16At many points during this section of this book I use information on Hasse diagrams, partial
ordering analysis, etc., taken and adapted from Guttman (1991).
17What Krauss means by these terms is as follows: Ground = a perspectival lattice; ﬁg-
ure = perception; not-ﬁgure = reﬂection, frame; not-ground = ﬁeld as ﬁgure, retinal surface.
18I interviewed Professor Krauss to explore her ﬁgure-ground understanding of the grid. She
emphasized the importance in formulating her thoughts of post-modern philosophy and especially
Levi-Strauss’s essay on myth and she noted how myth is central to several Modernist painters. In
the interview she stated her belief that the ﬁgure–ground/not ﬁgure–not ground binary distinction
is an essential combination that “takes” the visual ﬁeld “down to the bare bones”. She
acknowledged Mitchell’s (1995) criticisms of her ideas regarding the “silence” that is present in a
30

Sensing the Art Object

Krauss draws lines with two-way arrowheads around the perimeter between the
four elements and two similar lines are drawn within the square to connect these
four poles. In an exclusive, orthogonal and serially ordered manner, the perimeter
embodies ﬁgure versus ground relations and along with the internal dimensions
(that allow for context and active, motivated perception) provides a complete or
total account, according to Krauss, for all possible element relationships. Krauss
claims that we perceive the visual ﬁeld as ﬁgure and ground, but experience it
holistically.19 In slightly greater detail, the border of this diagram holds perceptual
terms in mutual opposition (ﬁgure versus ground, etc.). Going around the square’s
perimeter it repeats the same binary oppositions, providing all possible ﬁgure–
ground distinctions through a series of ordered transformations. However, the
central crossover axes are mirrors of the same thing and the same as Structuralism’s
double negatives. These ‘non’ poles are the less absolute statements of fact within
the system. However, Krauss claims that it is the complexity of the diagonal
opposition that allows for the role of context and active, motivated perception.
Modernism rejects the secondary role of ground as support for the ﬁgure in favour
of the simultaneous perception of both. The ﬁeld speciﬁes its ﬁgure within a given
context, shown by the central axes. Thus, Krauss says that the ground in Modernist
painting may be used by the artist only as ‘ﬁgure transformed’, the ‘not ground’ has
come to the works surface and is in a state of perfect consonance with the ﬁgure—
the work takes in ground as ﬁgure.
Thus, Krauss maps the universe of visual perception through the distinction
between ﬁgure–ground through holding the polar opposites of ﬁgure–ground con-
stant within a four-pole mirror inversion, as a square bound together by a system of
double-negatives and logic. By using this model, Krauss ﬁnds a way of under-
standing modernist logic, releasing the energy contained within their rationale: For
her, the model contains an inﬁnitely usable schema for understanding. Krauss
describes the Klein group model as containing the following elements: ground = a
(Footnote 18 continued)
grid, a criticism with which I concur. She also said that her work was inﬂuenced by Fred
Jameson’s book “The Political Unconscious”. She concluded by providing references to her more
recent articles, work and thoughts.
19I provide greater detail about Krauss’ Klein Group and ﬁgure–ground relationship in relationship
with two-dimensional abstract art in Hackett (2016). The conversion of information we gather
through our senses into thoughts seems important in Krauss’ model. Krauss sees vision to be the
ground whereas ﬁgure she claims to be constructed cognitively outside of ground through an
active, motivated process. Through being conceptually stringent her Klein group, she states, offers
an account all the associations between the concepts located at the poles of her diagram. Moreover,
she claims that the Klein group makes visually apparent the rational construction of visual per-
ception through showing on the upper and lower axes the differences between the two different
forms of visual perception. She states that the upper axis embodies the theoretical difference
between ﬁgure and ground and the lower axis questions ﬁgure/ground in Modernist artwork,
not-ﬁgure versus not-ground as empirical (contextual/cognitive) visual experience. However, this
appears to be a self-sustaining argument: She asserts that the model is total and rigorous in its
statement due to the structure she uses to construct it and then claims its utility in answering the
questions from which the model was formed.

perspectival lattice; ﬁgure = perception; not-ground = ﬁeld as ﬁgure, retinal sur-
face; not-ﬁgure = reﬂection, frame. Moreover, she says that the Klein group
visually depicts the relationships between the terms at the poles and is itself bound
by the same logic which completely structures the visual ﬁeld. The frame explicates
visually the dynamic of its logic. It shows the difference between the two different
forms of vision in the upper and lower axes. The upper axis is the contrast between
ﬁgure–ground. The lower is the reﬂexive questioning of ﬁgure–ground present in
Modernist artwork. This is active perception, vision within a context, not-ﬁgure
versus not-ground, vision within cognition: when one is both seeing and perceiving.
The Klein group represents the fundamentals of perception—the ﬁgure versus
ground absolute and the fuzzier not-ﬁgure versus not-ground. The absolute poles
allow perception to occur through the allowance of ﬁgure–ground separation.
Krauss claims the not-ﬁgure and not-ground are the group’s other poles in this
statement of empirical reality which has found its representation in modernist art’s
character in the use of, “grids, the monochrome, the all-over painting, the
color-ﬁeld, the mise-en-abyme of classical collage, the nests of concentric squares
or circles.” (Krauss 1994, pp. 14–15). This negates, or at least challenges, ﬁgure
ground reality through maintaining and questioning it at the same time. Not-ground
is that place of empirical visual apprehension and not-ﬁgure is where vision is part
of the person, is acted upon and incorporated within the body of personal experi-
ence, both forms and is formed by the perceptual schema, the endless triangle of
Neisser’s perceptual cycle. This is the axis that accounts for form, ﬁgure–ground.
Krauss attempts to precede the experience of vision by deﬁning the precondition
for visual experience as being the structure of the visual ﬁeld. This structure cannot
be the ﬁgure–ground itself, or any empirical ‘ordering’ of this primacy, as, she says,
the visual ﬁeld is the background to objects in our perception. Moreover, the
structural qualities of vision, she says, are not behind or afterwards in vision because
the ﬁgure–ground must be perceived simultaneously and become a form of cognition
which must exist beyond the ﬁgure–ground distinction. For Krauss, ﬁgure is what
we perceive as ‘pure exteriority’ and is differentiated from ground by the perceiver’s
active labours. The ﬁgure is immediately apparent through the viewer’s, motivated
presence and active overlaying of the retinal images he or she perceives.20
If Krauss’ categories of ﬁgure, ground, not-ﬁgure, not-ground, adequately
describe modernist art then the Klein group model, through its conceptually rig-
orous and exclusive account, explains the relations between the terms of its four
poles. Krauss concludes that the model, through its ﬁnite pairings generates a
predictable and ﬁxed number of artistic practices. The model is absolute as is the art
it accounts for. The model allows the questioning of modernist logic, the supposed
completeness of visual experience, the optical logic of mainstream Modernism.
20When the frame acts as a ﬁgure, it exists through a subtractive serial logic, as outside and inside,
“… the ﬁgure and the frame turning the painting into a map of logical relations and the topology of
self containment. Whatever is ‘in’ the ﬁeld is there because it is already contained ‘by’ the ﬁeld,
forecast, as it were, by its limits.” (Krauss 1994, pp. 18–19, original emphasis). Such an image, as
is the graph itself, is one of immediacy and self-complete enclosure.

Sensing the Art Object

In the preceding pages I have devoted some time to the consideration of Krauss’
Klein group model of ﬁgure–ground relations. The extent of my coverage is for
several reasons: Prmarily, it is to illustrate one manner in which a theoretical
approach to understanding abstract art has been developed. My intention here is to
tender the illustration of Krauss’ intricate modelling to set the scene for my equally
complex
task
of
depicting
the
perception
and
understanding
of
abstract
three-dimensional art. Furthermore, I would argue, that my coverage of Krauss’
Klein group demonstrates the paucity of understanding that occurs when a speciﬁc
aspect of the perception of the art image or object is isolated and proposed to
account for the totality of the perceptual process.
In the section below I now turn to Rosalind Krauss’ concept of sculpture in the
expanded ﬁeld. In a similar manner to the ﬁgure–ground account she proffered for
experiencing two-dimensional art, Krauss employs a solitary construct in her
attempt to explain and elucidate perception of three-dimensional abstract art.

This brings us to the other phrase that Krauss used in her writing, that of the
expanded ﬁeld. Krauss employed the terms ﬁgure–ground in reference to
two-dimensional artworks, whereas she used the phrase, expanded ﬁeld, exclu-
sively in reference to three-dimensional art, which she offered as a descriptive term
in both sculptural and architectural contexts. It appears that Rosalind Krauss
originated the phrase, ‘sculpture in the expanded ﬁeld’, in 1979 in reaction to the
preceding two decades during which time traditional sculpture had been supple-
mented with other three-dimensional art forms such as: land art; installations;
interventions; other performance related works; etc. As the breadth in inclusiveness
of the variety regarding three-dimensional artworks increased, the term sculpture as
it had traditional been employed and understood became inadequate and essentially
lost its meaning and explanatory power. The concept of the expanded ﬁeld as
related to sculpture was vigorously adopted by the art world as this represented a
dynamic theory, an inclusive and ﬂexible description of three-dimensional art-
works. In her writing Krauss presents a formal defense, explanation and justiﬁca-
tion for a new broad conceptualization of sculpture in general and site-speciﬁc
earthworks in particular.
In her essay Sculpture in the Expanded Field the scene is set for understanding
this term. Thus, Krauss puts the bounds upon her writing’s content as being
sculpture broadly conceived to take in the expanded sculpture or earthwork situated
within location that includes space within the work. As I noted previously, many
‘new’ forms of three-dimensional artwork have, since the 1960s and the 1970s,
come to be called sculpture. Krauss offers a loose-ﬁtting deﬁnition of sculpture, a
retrospective account, one that encompassed a great deal of what had come to be
thought of as sculpture. Krauss considers the rather restrictive notion that sculpture

as usually understood is traditionally tied to place as monument and Krauss elab-
orates upon this in her later essay, Fat Chance (see below).21
In her writing about sculpture, very broadly deﬁned and focusing upon land art,
Rosalind Krauss employs diagrammatic representations of her thinking about
three-dimensional art.22 Initially, Krauss develops a simple diagram in which she
locates any particular sculpture through its being located in a position being
between the two poles of not landscape and not architecture. Subsequently, Krauss
expands upon this elementary linearity. She positions this dimension as the bottom
of a square structure (a Klein group) with the top line of the square running between
the two pole of landscape and architecture. The top dimension she names the
complex dimension and the lower she esoterically calls the neuter dimension, neuter
as she conceives that this neuter dimension represents the binary opposition of
negative poles.
The above described model from Krauss was developed by her in her writings
during her era of structuralist understandings (see for example, Krauss 2010a) and it
appears that she has never completely rejected or negated the notions that she
proffered at this time. For instance, in the much later article ‘Fat Chance’ of 2004
(Krauss 2010b) Krauss still puts forward the Klein group model and suggests that
this depiction is still able to account for much art and has the ability to achieve this
in an explanatory way that develops comprehension of artwork. In Fat Chance,
Krauss comments mainly upon Bruce Nauman’s work and the art-historical era of
the 1960s. She reﬂects upon how during this period art occupied a discursive space,
by which I take her to mean that art was is discourse with a variety of spaces
or environments (the social environment, political environment, economic envi-
ronment, aesthetic environment, etc.), all varieties of environment within which an
artwork was surrounded. She further forwards the notion that art is characterized by
pluralism meaning that art at this time existed in a wide variety of different
mediums and also that artists could chose which medium he or she may use for a
speciﬁc work. To illustrate this point she offers as an example the work of Robert
Morris in plywood, stone, felt, bronze and mirrors.
Fifty-years ago Krauss repudiate pluralism in artistic practice. She then argued
that the history of art practice did not allow for pluralism and that artists at a given
time were bound by that time. In her later essay, Krauss focuses upon a 2001 video
installation by Morris, mapping the studio, and still proposing a structuralist
argument, she continued by asserting how an artist’s choice of possible practices,
‘were only a function of the history and structural logic of a given form’ (Krauss
2010b, p. 22).
21In this present section I will speak of the unique aspects of Krauss’ initial paper. I leave
discussion of her thinking that are similar with what she had to say later in Fat Chance, until I
discuss this paper.
22As I have previously noted, Krauss employs a very similar diagrammatic representations in her
expositions of two-dimensional art.

Sensing the Art Object

Krauss addressed the work of Bruce Nauman and writing on these works were
the subject of an interview conducted by Simon (1989). Krauss notes how during
this time Nauman was not only pluralistic in his artistic practice but also took great
pride in claiming to be pluralistic. However, Krauss asserts that Nauman’s work
explored what made various mediums or technical supports unique, or what they
were rather than engaging in a productive pluralism. She says that within his work,
Nauman connects with and is absorbed by the fundamental nature of a medium:
This, she says, is Nauman engaging in asking ontological questions. Sculpture, she
says, was engaged in a quest to originate knowledge regarding how the fundamental
qualities and attributes of sculptures’ parts, and how sculpture as a whole existed.
Thus, within structuralism Krauss was attempting to form a mereological account of
sculpture23 which, an account she proposed in, ‘Sculpture in the Expanded Field’
(Krauss 1979).
In this article Krauss starts by proposing that sculpture has always acted in the
role of being a monument and identifying sites in some particular and signiﬁcant
manner; for example, as a location of burial or ceremony. In this guise, the
sculptural monument has the semiotic role of demarcation, which takes one of two
forms. The monument may achieve its task of signiﬁcation through being within an
architectural site or building or outside in the open-air. An example of a within
building monument would be the tomb of the unknown-soldier in Westminster
Abbey, London. The Cenotaph in London is an illustration of a similar com-
memorative construction in an outdoor setting. Continuing, Krauss claims the
signiﬁed meaning of the constructed structure or monument is linked to its location
by the pedestal, architectural support or base upon which it is mounted. The base
she says securely fastens a work in a physical location whilst at the same time
separating the sculpture from simply being the substance from which it is made.
Krauss reiﬁes her structuralist tendencies in her writing by claiming that when
she thought about monuments she was struck by their similarity to a double neg-
ative. At this point in Krauss’s account, the language that Krauss uses requires a
linguistic specialist to interpret.24 Her description of the perceived double negative
is she says formed by bringing together the material givens of a sculpture along
with its neutralized dimensions. She qualiﬁes this description of sculpture as
not-architecture in combination with not-landscape. My understanding of what
Krauss means in the last sentence is that a monument within a building is
not-architecture whilst a monument outside a building is not-landscape.
Krauss expands upon the above somewhat rhetorical and tautologous description
to include the concepts that form the positive poles of architecture and landscape.
Having advanced this description of sculpture within location, Krauss develops a
series of four linear dimensions in the format of a square with the positive concepts
23As we will see in a moment, Krauss enters into this exploration by proposing a mereological
account not only of sculpture but also of two-dimensional artwork.
24This was apparent in her work on ﬁgure and ground.

of, architecture and landscape, and the negative concepts of not-architecture and
not-landscape. Krauss then places one of the terms at each of the corners or poles of
this two-dimensional square. In so doing Krauss claims to have formed another
Klein group, this time for sculpture that is located within a expanded context. Klein
groups, she says, are used within structuralist accounts in order to move beyond a
bi-polar linear structure through the introduction of uncertainty by the inclusion of
the logical opposites of the original positive bi-polar terms. This four-fold
arrangement is, she says, more ﬂexible and comprehensive when considering
complex questions about the nature of expanded ﬁeld sculpture where the four-pole
structure provides an air of caution when theorists attempt to deﬁne and under-
standing sculpture. The complexity and ﬂexibility that Krauss claims for the model,
achieved in the same way as it is in the ﬁgure/ground model, is brought about
through the six possible dimensions or bi-polar relationships that are extant within
Krauss’s Klein group (these dimensions are formed from all of the possible
pair-wise combinations of the four poles).
In the 1960s, sculpture possessed the appearance of being laisez-faire in its
pluralism and saw the dead and out-dated forms of sculpture transformed into land
art and the earth works of artists such as Robert Smithson, the performance art of
Yves Klein and Dino Buzzati and Daniel Buren, with Hans Haacke’s, and others,
institutional critique. Krauss applauds herself for recognizing and deﬁning the limits
of sculpture’s possibilities in her proposed Klein group. She goes even further to
say that an artist’s choices are similarly limited and thoroughly accounted for within
her Klein group and to support this vainglorious contention she presents artists and
their works to exemplify the poles of her model.
Throughout the entirety of my presentation of Rosalind Krauss’ Klein group
model for understanding the creation and reception of sculpture in the expanded
ﬁeld, it has been immediately apparent that there are many potential inadequacies in
her account of the perceptual process. A multitude of fundamental questions arise
which cast doubt upon the veracity of her claims and render her Klein group
impotent. Not least of these caveats is the lack of good reason why sculpture should
descriptively occupy just four polar positions and why these poles should be simple
pair-wise contradictions of each other. Krauss’s position is explained to some extent
by the fact that since the time of Krauss’ initial writing in which she employed the
Klein group (late nineteen seventies and early eighties) more sophisticated expla-
nations and understandings have emerged than the simplistic model described by the
structuralist depiction using polar opposites. However, this is not the case for her
self-congratulatory review of her own work written in 2010.25 Furthermore, her
model is not the end of the story, as Krauss would have us believe, as I have pro-
posed that it is possible to categorise art that has originated since the advent of
25Krauss cites Jameson’s writing about postmodernism and says that video came to stand for itself.
I assume Krauss singles out Jameson simply for the reason he uses a Klein group in his writing.

Sensing the Art Object

Modernism and to do so in such a way that provides us with greater understanding of
that art rather than simple double negatives that offer few learning opportunities.26
In addition, the question may be asked as to whether Rosalind Krauss’ Klein
group depiction of perception in reference to three-dimensional abstract art, or
sculpture in the expanded ﬁeld, is little more than a vainglorious expiation on her
part? This question draws our consideration to rest upon several issues. For
instance, it requires us to question the utility of the use of double negation.
Speciﬁcally, the question that we delve deeper into Rosalind Krauss’ use of the
double
negative
and
her
comments
upon
landscape/not-landscape
and
architecture/not architecture negations in what seems to me to be an inﬂated
manner. Krauss’ work also expresses a contentious point of view as perception of
perspective has been considered by many to be anything but a time sequential series
of rule-governed events (as Krauss sees this). Moreover, time differentials between
aspects of perception are of such minute proportions as to suggest they may be
experienced simultaneously. Examples of this can be seen in the works of the
ancient metaphysicists who spoke about causal powers. However, for them, cau-
sation resides in the intimate relationship between what is seen and the person who
is doing the seeing. On this understanding, the image causes the viewer to see the
form or quantity and quality of an object. From the perspective of perceptual
neuroscience, the concept of visual perception in general, and the perception of
perspective in particular, may again be seen as requiring an intimate relationship
between what is seen and the person doing the seeing.
Neuroscience has identiﬁed structures in the brain that selectively respond to
aspects of the visual image, such as faces, lines, interacting lines, and many other
forms. As a consequence of these, perception of visual perspective does not seem to
be adequately explained by the notion of space sequential rules, although there are
undoubtedly regularities in the perceptual process that approximate rules, (such as
parallax), and which approximate a visual sequence especially when motion is
added to the viewer’s point of view. Notwithstanding this latter point, I contest that
a more thorough and robust account for our understanding of what we see is
provided by the amalgamation of perception within a categorical ontology of
greater sophistication than the Klein group’s simple negation. The last point leads
me to review an alternate and more complex theoretical outlook on visual per-
ception, that of Paul Crowther.
26In the notes on the book-jacket of Krauss’ (2010) review of her art criticism, Perceptual
Inventory, it states that the art critic’s role is to constantly revise his or her ideas regarding
contemporary art; its direction and its signiﬁcance. These are ﬁne and laudable words, which are
not supported by Krauss’s later writing. When commenting upon sculpture, Krauss demonstrates
little growth in her thoughts over thirty years and is still propounding an overly simplistic model
for perception and understanding. It is also somewhat confusing to discover that Rosalind Krauss
also wrote about double negatives and sculptural space in her 1997 book Passages, in which this
phrase was included in the title of the last chapter. However, this writing comes from an earlier era
of Krauss’ thought and in this text the double negative she speaks about is taken to have an entirely
different meaning.

Paul Crowther
A professor of philosophy, Paul Crowther works at the National University of
Ireland Galway and has written on subjects related to philosophy and the history of
art. Crowther obtained his doctorate in philosophy at the University of Oxford
where he also taught art history. Additionally, he has worked at the University of St
Andrew’s, the University of Central Lancashire and Jacobs University Bremen in
Germany. His main areas of specialisation and expertise are in: metaphysics; visual
culture; aesthetics; phenomenology and Kant.
In Deﬁning Art: Creating the Canon (Crowther 2007) Paul Crowther offers a his
assessment of the likely merit of an aesthetic orientation in the deﬁnition of art and
the use of a philosophical approach to justify the values underlying the art canon.
He asks questions such as what constitutes art, what is it that enables us to decide
that one piece of art has more merit than another and what is it about an artwork that
bestows it with value? The institutional deﬁnition of art (Dickie 1974, 2000, and for
criticisms, support and modiﬁcations of the theory see: Bachrach 1977; Fokt 2013;
Oppy 1991; Stecker 1986; Wollheim 1987) has provided an alternate answer to
these queries from the positing of aesthetic form as an explanation. Crowther’s
normative model ﬁnds its strength through the development of a phenomenological
perspective, in which he places emphasis upon the expression of rudimentary
perceptual processes through the medium of visual art. Of particular interest to the
current research is the fact that Crowther’s model addresses abstract and conceptual
ﬁne art.
Crowther supports conventional notions and stresses representational or imita-
tional qualities in the deﬁnition of art. However, he emphasizes characteristics such
as the intangible connection between a piece’s artistic worth and associations with
the knowledge, imagination and understanding of a piece and its associated
art-historical links, links that are typically not readily evident. Through this process,
an artwork, he says, may be objectively characterised in terms of links to the canon.
The position Crowther takes leads him to be wary of notions of aesthetics as being
determinants of artistic value. Crowther also stresses the importance of the concept
of style in his thinking about art where he sees the style of an image as being able to
decode the artwork’s thematic topic. Furthermore, if through historical comparison
we ﬁnd an item to have a style that is original then the piece may be accorded to
have merit as art.
As the model I will develop is cognitive/perceptual in structure, Crowther’s
model of what constitutes art is particularly appropriate to the present research as
his theory has its roots in cognitive understandings and art appreciative assessments
associated with the creation of art works.

Crowther (2007)

Sensing the Art Object

Crowther presents a collected series of essays as a single book in his attempt to
fulﬁl the claims made in title of the book.27 The chapter of most interest to the
content of my book is Chap. 4, which contains Crowther’s deﬁnition in the form of
an ontological structure of how we experience abstract art. The chapter also
expands upon his theory for three-dimensional abstract art experience, which he
develops out of notions of the fundamental and in-built importance that exists in
creating art images. As well as establishing his theoretical stance, in the book
Crowther considers many other phenomenological aspects of art.
Crowther’s writing addresses what he sees as the way in which concepts sur-
rounding notions of the value of art have been treated with contempt over the
preceding decades by global consumerism of the postmodern era. This, he says, has
led to a reduction or deterioration in artistic value. A component of this degradation
in artistic value has come about through the manner in which postmodernism has
stressed the relativist position in according value to art and has afﬁrmed egalitarian
notions of the value of art. Human desires thus became shaped by the ﬂux of
intersecting social and economic fashions. Under such a value-based system, the
importance of how the art object is created is relegated to being behind the ideas or
impressions that result from the perception or experience of the art object or event.
Crowther (2007) believes that it is possible for a piece of artwork to possess an
individual style in a objective sense, where such objectivity comes about through
reference to the piece’s art historical context. He proposes that a picture or image
may acquire its value as art due to it possessing originality. If an artist’s work
possesses such originality of style, then this work he understands to become an
ideal form or model of such work. Furthermore, an individual work of art is able to
embody art related importance through its ability to enhance our art appreciative
thoughts and feelings along with culturally developing the means to instantiate
experiences within its idiom.28
By concentrating upon the image, Crowther facilitates the liveliness of art’s
aesthetic qualities. Furthermore, he asserts that art may be read as a mode of image
making and he deliberates ways in which a viewer of an artwork joins with artistic
meanings, aims and content. In so doing art can be thought of under notions of
forming new ideas or concepts, mental creativity and resourcefulness.
It is perhaps not of direct relevance to this current essay, but it is of interest to
note that the title of Crowther’s (2007) book intimates his deﬁning art and forming
a new canon. However, Crowther applies his consideration of art to more traditional
approaches such as (picture-based art, literature and music) and offers a mainly
Western-art based perspective. He largely ignores what may be thought of alter-
native types of art such as digital art. The art related characteristics of performance
and making run cardinally through Crowther’s deﬁnition of the art experience and
27Crowther introduces and then discusses concepts such as: style; image, temporality; meta-
physical depth; notions of the art canon; context; cognitive structure.
28Indeed, Crowther states that the rest of his book could be understood as an extension of the
thinking of Kant. Like Kant, Crowther also argues that judgements of taste make a claim to
objectivity.

he makes claims that the concept of art is a necessary phenomena required to
account for the innovative uses of speciﬁc art mediums.
The ﬁdelity of a person’s assessment of the value of an artwork, is for Crowther,
predicated upon the individual possessing the correct cerebral condition. This state
he says develops from an understanding of how a particular artistic medium has
previously been used, where this historical understanding allows us to assign a new
artwork a relative and value-based position. Thus Crowther accords value on the
basis of reference to the canon and assigns little value to an artwork
constituted-upon whether an artwork is found to be beautiful or not. Of particular
interest to my essay is the manner in which Crowther’s deﬁnition attempts to free
itself from the art market of the Western world. Crowther does this, as I have
alluded to above, by suggesting art value to be aesthetic and that the artistic canon
provides justiﬁcation for this belief29 and that notions of style constitute proxies for
historical differences.
In my current research, Paul Crowther’s writing has provided answers to
questions such as of what are the ontological components of ﬁne art? (see Chap. 4,
Crowther 2007). In my analyses of two-dimensional art (Hackett 2016) I adapted
Crowther’s ontology to enable my investigation of the perception of paintings and
drawings and in the section below I evaluate Crowther’s ontology as a model that I
may incorporate into an analysis of three-dimensional art. Crowther (2007) pro-
posed contextual visual space as being a place where the phenomenological
experience of art can exist. Contextual visual space, he says, is highly complex and
is the point at which our instantaneous visual world becomes perceived and visually
understood by us.
Crowther’s concept of contextual visual space is of importance when consid-
ering the perception and understanding of three-dimensional art as Crowther states
that it is through our occupancy of this space that we are able to comprehend the
contextual length, breadth and depth of art objects.30 Crowther elaborates upon this
space by deﬁning eight characteristics of an abstract artwork (in this book we are
obviously concentrating on three-dimensional works: sculptures, installations,
earthworks, etc.) that comprehensively structure contextual space.31 His eight
dimensions are:
1. resemblances to speciﬁc visual forms that arise though the beneﬁcial bringing
together of colours, shapes and textures (for example, seeing images in cloud
patterns);
29Crowther offers a normative aesthetics based upon artists as the intrinsic creators of images that
are referenced to the art historical differences that the artwork posses.
30If we did not possess contextual visual space Crowther envisions that we would perceive a ﬂat,
two-dimensional world.
31Crowther states that his eight dimensions appear to him to be a comprehensive structure for
conceptual space whilst he allows for the possibility that these dimensions may be sub-divided
and/or combined in a way that enables these new entities to be dimensions themselves.
40

Sensing the Art Object

2. the evocation of states of mind through gestural associations with visual forms
(for instance, violent shapes, depressing colours);
3. usually invisible visual features of items, relations, states of affairs such as: very
small surface features; internal conﬁgurations: ﬂeeting atmospheric effects;
unusual perspectives;
4. events, items, states of affairs that could possibly exist in perceptual and
physical environments other than their usual ones;
5. destruction, deconstruction, reduction, reconstruction, variations of familiar
events, items, states of affairs that results in a visual conﬁguration;
6. visual marks or intimations of previous, future or counterfactual events, items,
states of affairs;
7. spatial appearances structural features, such as colour, shape, volume, mass,
texture, density, geometric structure, alterations in positions, either on their own
or in combination;
8. imaginary and dream phenomena.
Crowther (2007) claims that the above eight dimensions comprehensively and
exhaustively account for the content of contextual visual space and that this
arrangement and the structured relationships between the eight elements enable
abstract art to be completely apprehended, discerned and grasped. In this way,
Crowther forwards an ontology for art experience.
In my earlier writing, I have summarised Crowther’s ontology (Hackett 2016) in
the following manner:
1. Resemblances creating resemblances through combination
2. Gestural Associations evocation through gestural associations with visual
forms
3. Revelations of usually invisible visual features
4. Novel Environments existence as a product of usual environments
5. Neoteric Conﬁgurations reconﬁguration of the familiar producing neoteric
visual conﬁgurations
6. Visual Suggestions visual traces or suggestions
7. Spatiality/Structure structural features of spatial appearances
8. Fantasy imaginary and dream phenomena.
I present the above Crowther ontology in an abbreviated format so as to enable
the reader to more easily appreciate how Crowther’s dimensions form a complete
set of categories, which, he says, when they are taken together, allow us to com-
prehend the variation within and between three-dimensional abstract pieces of art.
In the last few pages, I have made available brief details regarding the research
of Paul Crowther. At this point of the book, I will not go into further details
regarding his research or writing, as this will constitute the main theoretical
framework for my own research. As such, I will turn to Crowther many times and I
will include more from him at the appropriate places in the following chapters.

Conclusion
In this chapter, I have offered the work of two theoreticians, Rosalind Krauss and
Paul Crowther, both of whom have suggested a model for the understanding of
abstract art. Each model is very different in terms of its content and the aims that
each author had for their theoretical structure. However, both Crowther and Krauss
believe that consideration of their respective model allows the reader greater
comprehension of how we view and understand abstract art. I question but do not
speciﬁcally deny these claims. However, as noted, I believe there are inadequacies
in their approaches and the knowledge development that each model facilitates.
Most importantly to my criticisms of Crowther’s and Krauss’ models32 is the
inadequacy of both to demonstrate ongoing reciprocal interactions or inﬂuences that
must exist between different characteristics of such a complex experience as the
experience involved when perceiving, understanding, appreciating, valuing, dis-
liking, etc., an artwork.
In the following chapter, I emphasise the belief that interactions exist between
Crowther’s eight characteristics. I introduce facet theory and the mapping sentence
as a possible research technique through which a far reaching and comprehensive
understanding of abstract three-dimensional art may be developed. I employ facet
theory and mapping sentences in my writing and research as this structural theory
has the potential ability to embody and expiate the complexity of aesthetic
experiences.

Chapter 3
A Mapping Sentence Account
of Non-traditional Three-Dimensional Art
Abstract In chapter three I present an augmentation to existing models of visual
perception that have been developed to account for the perception and under-
standing of the experience of three-dimensional ﬁne art. The chapter begins with a
reﬂection upon how the model I propose draws upon the scholarship of Crowther
(2007) in conjunction a modiﬁcation of the mapping sentence approach used as a
qualitative or philosophical research approach (Hackett 2014, 2016a, b). I delve
into mapping sentences and I use these organizational templates to elucidate the
writing of Rosalind Krauss by modelling how she has considered two-dimensional
(Krauss 1986) and three-dimensional (Krauss 1979) modern abstract art. In facet
theory research mapping sentences are frequently used either alone or in initial
stages of research into a content domain using smallest space analysis (SSA) and to
guide interpretation of later partial order scalogram analysis (POSA). In earlier
publications I have put forward the mapping sentence as a structural template for
understanding two-dimensional art (Hackett 2016b) and in this chapter I offer a
modiﬁed version of this mapping sentence to account for the experience of
three-dimensional abstract art.

Introduction
In this chapter I bring together many of the ideas of other scholars that I have
presented earlier in this book. I initially consider the work of Rosalind Krauss, as this
applies to three-dimensional art, and I provide a mapping sentence depiction of her
theoretical model. I then move on to consider Paul Crowther’s ontology for art

experience as this scholarship represents an extremely thorough portrayal of this
content area. More speciﬁcally I bring together: the work of Paul Crowther; my
research on two-dimensional ﬁne art perception; the perception of three-dimensional
abstract ﬁne art; ontology; mereology; facet theory and the mapping sentence.
Through attempting to unite these approaches, I explicitly aim to produce an
understanding of how we perceive three-dimensional abstract ﬁne art within phe-
nomenologically valid contexts.
The ﬁndings I present represent an extension of my earlier research and writing
and consequently, the structure of this chapter along with its theoretical content
reﬂects that of my earlier publications, especially Hackett (2014 and 2016b).
However, my earlier research was addressing two- rather than three-dimensional
works of art and what I present in this chapter not only consolidates my existing
model but also represents an extension of this structural depiction from my earlier
publications. Furthermore, in this chapter I extend my research to address
three-dimensional forms of ﬁne art using my ontological based understanding of
ﬁne-art perception and creation.
In the previous chapter, I brieﬂy reviewed the writing of Rosalind Krauss, in
which she employed a Klein group model in her attempts to explain the perception
and comprehension of modernist art in general and in particular three-dimensional
artwork with an emphasis on land art. This review of Krauss’ writing on the Klein
group model has proven to be extremely important, and perhaps the most widely
quoted and inﬂuential, art critical writing about this genre of abstract art. I also
presented Krauss’ work to set the scene for the presentation in this chapter of my
own model that I propose in the stead of the Klein group: viz, the mapping sentence.
My review of art theoretical, philosophical and psychological research has
demonstrated an inadequacy in explanations regarding how we perceive and
understand abstract ﬁne art: Below I will review my reasons for considering extant
explanations to be lacking in some ways. In this chapter I make claims for the
utility of a model I have developed (Hackett 2016b) that I have used to facilitate
understanding of speciﬁcally two-dimensional abstract art and I suggest modiﬁca-
tions of this model in order that the model may address three-dimensional artwork.
I believe that the initial model, when applied to two-dimensional art, solved some of
the problems of the existing depictions such as their overly simplistic and frag-
mented nature. After brieﬂy outlining the development of the two-dimensional
model, I proffer a detailed, applied and thorough approach for developing the
required philosophical and psychological knowledge regarding how perception of
three-dimensional abstract works comes about. The basis for my developing the
model is rooted in a belief that using a categorial approach to understanding and
depicting visual perception offers seminal insight into this research area.

In Hackett (2016a, b) I suggested that psychological and philosophical research
typically offers a rather unsophisticated view of the perception of art, and that this is
especially so of abstract art. I also suggested that these accounts are often somewhat
aged in their nature and have not thoroughly taken into account some more con-
temporary research from psychology and neuroscience. Because of these claims, I
offered an ontological account of visual perception as this applies to art that is
two-dimensional. The framework I suggested for this ontological structure took the
format of a metaphysical mereology that I developed under a facet theory rubric: in
this research, I proposed a qualitative mapping sentence to explore the empirical
psychological and philosophical content of art perception.1 In the section that
follows, I review some of the ways that I have used mapping sentences within the
context of research into different aspects of ﬁne art.
3.2
Understanding Art Using Mapping Sentences
I start by stating that the phenomenology of perception is of undoubted importance
when we attempt to deﬁne what constitutes a piece of art. Furthermore, this
statement holds true when we ask why an object or event2 is considered a work of
art whilst an ostensibly very similar object is thought of in terms of being an object
devoid of the quality of being art. When we are considering the ontological basis of
objects as these relate to determining the art status of the an art related object, then
the phenomenological environment within which the ontology resides will be
highly inﬂuential and must be clearly identiﬁed as the context relates to the events
ontological existence. Indeed, the phenomenological context of a three-dimensional
abstract art object will likely be an intrinsic component of such an ontological
description.
1In this earlier book I put forward a mapping sentence for two-dimensional art and noted how this
had grown out of my research into other areas of research for which I had offered metaphysical
descriptive ontologies. Examples of these included my using the mapping sentence to allow an
interpretation of part of E.H. Lowe’s philosophical writings (Lowe 2007), Both Lowe’s original
work and my mapping sentence interpretation of this took the forms of categorical ontologies. In
Hackett (2016a) I claimed that the mapping sentence is a way of communicating and availing
understanding of categorial ontologies that clearly presents the content of ontologies and suggests
an appropriate mereological arrangement to the units of the ontology.
2I will use the word art “object” or “event” in an interchangeable manner. To avoid tedious and
redundant writing I will also often use either of these terms to imply the inclusive understanding
that is embodied in the phrase “art object or event”, unless I speciﬁcally state that in a particular
situation such inclusivity should not be assumed.
3.1
Introduction
47

In Hackett (2016b), when I spoke about two-dimensional art, I noted that it is
important that any experience of ﬁne art must possess phenomenological speciﬁcity
and I commended the use of the mapping sentence for producing ontological and
mereological descriptions of art as mapping sentences may be written to possess
phenomenological speciﬁcity. Moreover, I noted how the mapping sentence locates
a description of an art event through focusing its deﬁnition upon a particular
phenomenon within the speciﬁcity of the range, background and content facets. In
the writing that follows, I will consequently develop and offer mapping sentences
that expressly and explicitly consider the ontological nature of a phenomenologi-
cally bound understanding of three-dimensional abstract art (later in this chapter I
will speak more about the mapping sentence I develop to account for perception of
three-dimensional abstract art, which is based upon the ontology by Crowther,3).
Before I turn to this mapping sentence, brieﬂy consider the work of Rosalind
Krauss and how this may be understood within a mapping sentence framework.4
3.3
Facet Analysis of Rosalind Krauss’ Depiction
of Three-Dimensional Art
3.3.1
Two-Dimensional Art
In her attempts to bring clarity to how modern art is perceived and understood,
Krauss (1986) offered a model for this body of knowledge in the form of a Hasse
diagram. In Fig. 3.1, I presented the content of this Hasse model expressed within a
mapping sentence format. Since its publication, Krauss’ depiction has received
considerable attention form critics and scholars who have noted the involvedness of
the model. However, when stated in a mapping sentence in Fig. 3.1 the Klein group
appears overly rudimentary. Of course, much of the complexity of Krauss’ diagram
exists in the intricate relationships between the second and third content facet
(ﬁgure/ground—not ﬁgure/not-ground).
I have illustrated Krauss’ writing in a mapping sentence format in order to reveal
more clearly the complexity of relationships she claimed to exist between elements
3Later in this chapter I offer a phenomenological account of three-dimensional works of art in: a
mapping sentence for deﬁning perception of three-dimensional abstract art in the form of a
comprehensive speciﬁcation of the major components of this experience (facets) and their sub
components (elements).
4I later attempt to demonstrate the relationships between facets in the mapping sentence through
the use of partial order scalogram analyses (POSA) of responses broken-down by the proﬁles of
the facets from the mapping sentence. In order to familiarise the reader with POSA and its
application within the context of this book, later in this essay I ﬁrst present POSAs of the work on
abstract three-dimensional art by Krauss and Crowther.

of her thinking. I have not included a range facet in the mapping sentence as Krauss
did not specify any way in which she imagined her model being appraised or
instigating appraisal. However, it is my contention that none of her models or
representations are detailed or intricate enough to allow a comprehensive under-
standing of the phenomenologically based nature of three-dimensional art experi-
ence. Therefore, I now return to the writing of Paul Crowther (which I introduced
earlier in this book) who has suggested an ontology of greater intricacy as being
able to better represent the experience of such art works.
3.4
Facet Analysis of Paul Crowther’s Ontology
of Three-Dimensional Art
Crowther’s Ontology presents and summarises the basic extant experiential com-
ponents of abstract three-dimensional art (see Table 3.1). This table contains the
same information as appeared in Chap. 2 and I repeat it here in the format of a table
to allow the reader to easily refer this to the mapping sentence in Fig. 3.2. However,
the ontology on its own says little about the ways in which his eight ontological
components may be assembled, aggregated, combined or in some other way
brought together and expressed or experienced as an art event or object. What I am
noting here is the lack of a mereological understanding and I am stressing the need
for such an understanding to be built employing Crowther’s ontology. In an earlier
essay (Hackett 2016b) I suggested the need for a similar mereology of Crowther’s
dimensions in relationship to two-dimensional art and I offered a mapping sentence
as a structuring device to enable this through clearly explicating the ontology’s
inter-dimensional arrangement (Fig. 2.1).

demonstrated the manner in which the mapping sentence was able to assist in our
understanding of how any speciﬁc abstract two-dimensional abstract artwork may
differ from other two-dimensional abstract artworks. Furthermore, I suggested how
Crowther’s eight category ontology, when categories were re-framed as eight
facets, provided a framework for this understanding. Moreover, I demonstrated how
questions regarding the inﬂuence of each of the eight facets/dimensions of the
mapping sentence mereology provided insight into the usefulness of each of
Crowther’s dimensions. In the mapping sentence of Crowther’s model for under-
standing abstract three-dimensional art (Fig. 3.2) I have proposed a similarly
explanative tool in reference to these three-dimensional artworks. Additionally, (in
Hackett 2016b) I demonstrated how some of Crowther’s characteristics did not
appear to be as pertinent as other characteristics in their ability to provide an
account of my experiences of a particular abstract painting or drawing. I achieved
an understanding of the combined role of Crowther’s characteristics by employing

using the eponymous diagram developed by German mathematician Helmut Hasse,

chacteristics in relation to my experience of three-dimensional abstract art.

Conclusion
I have, in this chapter, illustrated the approach that I have taken in my attempts to
develop a theoretical understand abstract art within its phenomenological context.
This has taken the form of a mapping sentence depiction of the facets and facet
elements of three-dimensional abstract art experiences within a framework made-up
of Crowther’s characteristics. It is my claim that this mapping sentence offers a
theoretical template that is important in understanding viewers’ experiences. In the
next chapter, I consider proﬁle sets of these facets and facet elements using partial
order scalogram analysis to enable a greater understanding of the combined effects
of these facets and facet elements. In doing this I attempt to demonstrate the
phenomenological experience of three-dimensional abstract art.

A Partial Ordering Mereology
for Non-traditional Three-Dimensional Art
Abstract In this section of the research, I use POSA to facilitate more thorough
comments upon how we perceive and understand three-dimensional abstract art. In
my exposition of POSA, I take some time to delve into previous uses of the
approach to reveal partial ordering of variables. I present examples of POSA’s
previous theoretical deployment and I demonstrate its application using applied
art-related examples. Speciﬁcally, in the chapter, I consider a partially ordered
model of the eight characteristics from Crowther’s ontology. I assert the usefulness
of POSA by referencing how I have used this approach in earlier research that
incorporated Crowther’s characteristics within a mapping sentence which I anal-
ysed using POSA to facilitate greater understanding of two-dimensional abstract art.
I conclude the chapter by considering how the mapping sentence models I have
developed for two and three-dimensional art, and partial order analysis of facets
from the mapping sentences for two and three-dimensional art, relate to each other.

Introduction: Partial Order Analysis
of Three-Dimensional Art
In my earlier research, I proposed that a series of dimensions (or facets) appear to
account for viewers’ perception of abstract two-dimensional art. I also offered a
mapping sentence that embodied and presented the facets I proposed in a manner that
facilitated an appreciation of the facets, and the elements of the facets, as these come
together to describe the experience of this form of artwork. The mapping sentence for
Partial Ordering and Partial Order Scalogram Analysis (POSA) are data analysis procedures and
I will use the terms interchangeably. Analyses that attempt to reveal partial ordering do so to
display the variables within a research project that can be demonstrated to posses ordering in
their associated responses.

two-dimensional abstract art perception was complex in its nature and reﬂected the
equally intricate character of this type of art and the perceptual experience of this. In
order to demonstrate adequately the understanding of multi-component construction
of abstract art and to capture the potentially ambiguous perceptions that may arise
from abstract art necessitates a multi-faceted understanding of this genre of art.
Therefore, a model embodying multiple facets has the potential to allow meaningful
comparison of different abstract artworks and to enable the development of a broad
understanding of our perceptions and experiences of abstract art.
In this book, as in my research viewing two-dimensional abstract art, I posit that
viewers of three-dimensional abstract art possess an ordered preference for different
examples of this form of art. Additionally, I suggest that it is possible to compare
any particular piece of artwork with other three-dimensional pieces of art through
reference to these ordered preferences. This is a simple notion and to illustrate this I
will present examples of pair-wise comparisons of abstract three-dimensional art to
illustrate the more intricate comparisons I will undertake later in this essay. These
latter comparisons will result in my identiﬁcation of the nature of the dimensions (or
facets) I claim structure our perceptions of abstract three-dimensional art.
The foundations of the perceptual model that I develop are in the combined
effects of eight characteristics of abstract art in Crowther’s ontology. However,
before I enter into this analysis I initially illustrate a simpliﬁed example of the
appreciation of abstract art, using ordered preference.
4.1.1
An Example of Partial Ordering
As an example of the partial ordering procedure that I use later in this research, I
initially select three abstract three-dimensional artworks chosen to constitute an
example of this art genre. Each of these three-dimensional artworks is by a different
artist: Arp; Bourgeois; Caro, and I represent each artwork by the initials of the
artists who created the artwork as A, B, C. In this example, the speciﬁc pieces of
artwork are of no importance as I am simply illustrating the process of partial
ordering. Later in this chapter I will evaluate particular artworks.
In this example, I am attempting to demonstrate the preferential perceptions for
each of these three-dimensional artworks. In an endeavour to achieve this, I start by
putting the three artworks into rank order in terms of overall perceived preference.
I have chosen preference as the criteria by which I order the pieces but I may use
many potential criteria to establish an ordered arrangement. For instance, I could
employ physical characteristics as the basis for ordering, or the retail value of each
piece. I could also have ordered the works in terms of how much each encourages
viewer interaction and physical involvement, and of course, there are many other
criteria from which I may select whilst assuring that the criteria chosen are pertinent
and important to viewer.
Having determined viewer meaningful criteria by which to rank the selected
pieces of art, I may simply order the artworks by the given criteria (variables) such
54

as size. When ranking by physical properties this procedure may be relatively
unproblematic but greater difﬁculty can arise if I attempt to assess works in terms of
their less concrete features such as thematic content. In these situations, I have to
attempt to establish a procedure for deﬁning a chosen feature in terms of its impact
upon an individual viewing the artwork. For example, I may assign a numerical
measure that represents the complexity of content where this is taken to be the
number of separately identiﬁable and meaningful perspectives that are perceived to
exist within a three-dimensional artwork. Furthermore, I could survey viewers
regarding their thoughts and feelings toward a three-dimensional artwork’s content
and then analyse the content of their interviews to reveal thematic commonalities in
these assessments. After having conducted such a viewer driven procedure, I can
then use the information that has emerged as a basis upon which to rate the pres-
ence, absence or extent of each feature in each artwork. Under one, or combinations
of these foregoing approaches, I may establish criteria for assessment. However,
even when a criterion may appear to be a simple feature, characteristic or criterion,
this quality may be found to be made up of sub-criteria and I will need to identify
and use these sub-divisions within later assessments.1
Having established the dimensions upon which I will ask viewers to evaluate
artworks I can designate the content of perception under which I am claiming
understanding of the speciﬁed art pieces as being q1, q2, … qn, where q1 … qn
deﬁne viewer meaningful variation in three-dimensional artworks (in this
example: A … C). In this way, I arrive at properties or qualities (q) of the artworks
(of which there are three in this example of which there could be any number). If I
then write the identities of the three-dimensional artworks as rows in a matrix and
the properties of evaluation as the matrix’ columns, I am potentially able establish a
total experiential account of artworks and their perception (see Table 4.1).
The matrix in Table 4.1 theoretically accounts for the perception of the three
chosen three-dimensional artworks by the speciﬁed artists (Arp, Bourgeois and
Caro). Looking at this data matrix the next question that arises is: how does each of
the qualities (q1 … qn) contribute in structuring the perceptual evaluations (pe1 …
pe9) of artworks (A–C)? I may also ask the question: do the characteristics (q1 …
qn) have a monotonic relationship in reference to the artworks speciﬁed (A–C)?2
What I have stated immediately above is highly speculative and to further clarify
the meaning presented in the content of the data matrix I offer the following
example. In this example, I propose that we are viewing illustrations of pieces of
land-art.3 I am able to specify many characteristics of each artwork, for example,
1The establishment of important evaluation criteria is often initially a theoretical question but the
validity of criteria and sub-features of these is ultimately an empirical question.
2A monotonic relationship is a relationship where an increasing value for one characteristic is
associated with increases in other characteristics and an increase in overall liking of the
three-dimensional artworks.
3For the sake of this illustration I propose that we ignore the experiential and psychological
differences between viewing two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional works of art
and viewing the three-dimensional artworks themselves. The two experiences are obviously
4.1
Introduction: Partial Order Analysis of Three-Dimensional Art
55

I may state the size of a three-dimensional artwork as q1 and measure this in square
metres. In relation to this criteria of size let us imagine, for a moment, that larger
land artworks are found to be more spectacular, more impressive and thus rated
more highly on criteria of appreciation and that relatively smaller land artworks are
rated lower on this criteria. However, this trend for liking the larger and physically
more impressive works may not always hold true and there may have been extreme
degrees of liking for some smaller, discrete works. Thus, size, as embodied in
characteristic q1 may be an easily established quantitative measure whereas the
psychological appraisal of q1 may be more complex and non-linear.
Empirical studies may also initiate a second characteristic q2 of viewers’
appreciation of land artworks. This second assessment criteria may ask respondents
to evaluate their preferences for the presence or absence of given aspects or features
within a piece of land art. In this instance, the presence of preferred features would
relate positively to perceptions and evaluations of a given work of land art.
Continuing, empirical research may have also determined an optimal number of
preferred aspects in such a way that more than this number of features within a
piece of land art is likely to lessen favourable assessment of the work.
I now take the two characteristics I have mentioned above, q1 and q2. It is
immediately apparent there may be an intricate interaction between the size of the
work and the number of preferred features it contains. It is likely that simply
increasing the number of preferred features and enlarging the artwork and then
adding the number of features to the size of the work would not guarantee an
increase in viewers’ positive ratings. However, the two characteristics of size and
feature number are experientially correlated. Consequent upon this association I
may state that if the viewers’ assessments of these features were isolated from each
other this isolation would create an artiﬁcial viewing situation. Moreover, as a
correlation exists between the two criteria it is essential to evaluate the combined
effects of the two characteristics simultaneously.
In the example of the characteristics, q1 and q2, I have simpliﬁed their nature so
that both may be quantitatively assessed (in terms of the work’s size and the number
of preferred features). However, it is often the case that such a rudimentary positive
relationship is not present. For instance, quantitative characteristics may be
negatively related to each other and ordered in opposite directions to each other

(e.g., smaller size and a greater number of features are preferred). In addition,
characteristics may possess a relationship that is not strictly linear (a medium
number of features and a smaller size is most positively rated whilst a large number
and a medium size is most negatively assessed).
Whilst keeping the above caveats in mind, and if I am indeed able to identify characteristics
of three-dimensional land artworks that can be seen to be evaluation criteria that run
approximately from positive to negative, I am able to commence comparison of the three,
three-dimensional artworks (A,B,C) with each other. This being the case it is now possible
for me to enter hypothetical average ranking data into Table 4.2 and to provide an illus-
trative example of such a data matrix. The values in the matrix arise from asking a sample
of viewers to rank the three artworks along the three characteristics in Table 4.2. The
resulting matrix (in which low values always represent more positive evaluations and high
values represent greater negativity towards the piece) presents the average ranking for each
artwork on each criterion.
Inspection of the three characteristics in the above data matrix demonstrate that
artwork B is generally more liked than artwork A, as all characteristics of evalu-
ation of artwork B are more positive (lower) than all assessments of artwork A as is
its summated total of proﬁle scores. In terms of its overall rating, artwork C is less
liked than either artwork A or B. The three-dimensional artwork C however has a
proﬁle of evaluations, which are less favourable (higher) rankings than those given
to artwork B on all characteristics, a feature which makes these artworks directly
comparable on these criteria. However, artworks A and C cannot be directly
compared as the inter-relationship of evaluations is not consistent between the
proﬁles of the three-dimensional artworks—A is more liked than C on the ﬁrst
characteristic (q1), but C is more liked than A on the other 2 characteristics (q2, q3).
The example I have provided in the above data matrix is a somewhat artiﬁcial
example of comparing just three abstract three-dimensional artworks upon three
characteristics. If I had increased the number of three-dimensional artworks, and/or
the number of evaluative criteria, in the rating I would have expected that there
would be more non-comparable proﬁles than the number in my example. However,
my illustration of just three works of art and three characteristics presents a situation
in which it is relatively simple to establish an ordering of preference amongst the
artworks through the comparison of the summated mean rankings. As the number
of anomalous (non comparable) proﬁles increases then this summated score
becomes increasingly ambiguous in terms of interpreting the meaning of summated
scores. In the example matrix, I have however formed a partial ordering of

evaluations. A partial ordering is one in which only some pair-wise comparisons of
assessments are put into order (as shown in my example matrix).4
I now provide more details of the process of establishing a partial ordering of
items that are being investigated in a research project and the accepted rules for
achieving this, which, if the rules are appreciated, will assist in understanding the
process of partial ordering. Therefore, I propose calling a sample of abstract artworks
“object set X” where X is a ﬁnite set of these artworks. In the present example,
X consists of three-dimensional artworks A, B, C, and thus X = {A.B.C.}.5
Axiom 1: Reflexivity: A 2 X : A  A
Axiom 2: Anti-symmetry: A  B; B  A implies B ¼ A
Axiom 3: Transitivity: A  B and B  C implies A  C
Reﬂexivity: refers to the fact that a three-dimensional artwork can be compared
with itself and consequently.6,7
Anti-symmetry:
refers
a
situation
in
which
both
comparisons
of
three-dimensional artworks are valid, i.e., three-dimensional artwork B is under-
stood as more preferred than preferred equally to three-dimensional artwork A and
simultaneously, three-dimensional artwork A is understood as preferred more or
equally to three-dimensional artwork B, then three-dimensional artwork A is
identical with three-dimensional artwork B.
Transitivity: when considering three-dimensional artworks, transivity is char-
acterized by properties that are at least ordinally scaled. Examples of transivitive
4For instance, as abstract three-dimensional artwork A is larger than artwork B this may be written
as A > B. In POSA the speciﬁcation of a research project’s content is written: P being a data set of
N elements (e.g., three-dimensional artworks, aspects of three-dimensional artworks) (pi…pn) upon
which a set of k different variables (v1…vk) are observed. On this understanding, each element pi
may be typiﬁed by a proﬁle of attributes or dependent variables (vi
1…vi
k) and where an attribute is a
fully ordered category (as stated above). Each of these elements may be fully ordered in terms of
their own variable’s content. However, rankings of elements are potentially different and thus a
partial ordering may exist between elements. To enlarge upon Guttman’s understanding of POSA,
and applying this to abstract three-dimensional artworks, any two three-dimensional artworks may
be considered identical (pi = pj) if and only if (iff) their respective proﬁles are identical (vi
m…vj
m for
each and all m = 1…k); pi is greater than pj (pi > pj) iff vi
m ≥vj
m for every m = 1…k. What this
means is that for any three-dimensional artwork pi is ranked before pj in terms of some aspect of
abstraction, and pj is ranked before pi in terms of some other aspect of abstraction. On the latter
understanding the three-dimensional artworks would be considered incomparable.
5As I have stated above for a comparison between pairs of three-dimensional artworks to be made
the relationship ≤must exist as a binary relation among the objects.
6It should be noted here that the use of the letters A,B,C, is indicative of the three abstract paintings
by the three speciﬁed artists. These letters are used in axioms 1 to 3 for simplicity. However, in an
actual partial ordering the paintings themselves are not rated; what are rated are characteristics of
each of the paintings.
7I also make the obviously point that in the theoretical deﬁnition of reﬂexivity I am ordering
example artworks A. B. C. However, in my example of the ratings of three abstract
three-dimensional artworks given in Fig. 3.5, the ordering of paintings is B, A, C. The differences
between these orderings is, irrelevant to either examples or analyses.

measures include assessments of size or the monetary values of a three-dimensional
artwork as clear criteria for ordering the artworks exist. A researcher must establish
if the criteria used in an assessment are either nominally or ordinally structured
before using a qualitative variable in a partial order analysis.8 However, unclear
meaning or criteria may be used to characterise the content of a three-dimensional
artwork and the reason for ordering artworks may be uncertain. The reason for this
is that descriptions of the content of a three-dimensional artwork piece are typically
nominal in type, that is to say that ‘a statue of Caesar’ or ‘a light installation on
Viðey Island, Reykjavik’ are simply naming labels of a three-dimensional artwork’s
content and such descriptors cannot be used to rank order three-dimensional art-
works. However, I am able to pair a nominal description of a three-dimensional
artwork with an ordinal scale such as a preference of some form. For example,
I may tend to like installations better than statues and therefore statues ≤installa-
tions may form criteria for ordering my preferences.
POSET is an abbreviation for a partial ordering of a set of items and in POSET
analyses; the emergent partial order relationships ordering of a set of items may be
numerically stated. As well as expressing partially ordered sets numerically a Hasse
diagram may be used to graphically display any partial ordering among items that is
revealed during a partial ordering analyses. A small number of items may be
visually depicted in a Hasse diagram to identify the items (in our case aspects of
three-dimensional abstract artworks) that partially order the content area (later in
this chapter I provide examples of Hasse diagrams as I use these to interpret the
perception of three-dimensional abstract art).9
If we discover that x and y are two “ordered pair” variables with a relation such
that x ≤y, a Hasse diagram may be developed to express the positioning of variable
x in a vertical plane beneath y and subsequently connecting x and y with a straight
line. In a Hasse diagram the pair-wise comparison procedure is undertaken for all
variable pairs that may be typiﬁed using the x ≤y relation.10
It is important to draw Hasse diagrams with care, and when possible, to con-
struct the diagram with straight lines that do not cross each other and with as similar
a slope as is practicable. In the case of abstract three-dimensional artworks, the aim
8Often the assignment of a qualitative variable to being either nominal or ordinal is determined by
the reason for the research investigation and why items are being ranked.
9Furthermore, in circumstances where a small number of items (artworks) are considered, it is
possible to relax the requirements of spatial ordering. In this research, such a relaxation is due to
the three-dimensional artworks all being discretely identiﬁable art works on the one hand whilst
potentially
possessing
similarity
in
their
ranked
assessment.
Consequent
upon
this,
three-dimensional artworks may be treated as different three-dimensional artworks but equivalent
with identical data matrix rows. Moreover, when equivalent three-dimensional artwork proﬁles
exist removing equivalent items and leaving a single three-dimensional artwork to represent this
proﬁle simpliﬁes the data matrix. Later it is possible when writing up the research project to
reintroduce equivalent proﬁles to facilitate understanding of the complete partial ordering analysis
(Patil and Taillie 2004).
10The resulting diagram is a Hasse diagram, also called a partial order set diagram, order diagram
or line diagram.

Over the last few pages (and in the footnotes) I have gone to some lengths to
provide a thorough deﬁnition and a relevant example of the analysis procedure used
in this research. In the next section, I move on from this example and commence
my consideration of Paul Crowther’s ontology of art appreciation characteristics
through a partial ordering of his ontology.
4.2
Partial Ordering of Crowther’s Ontology
Crowther states that abstract art occupies a “massively complex contextual space”
(Crowther 2007 p. 94). His eight dimensions, he says, comprehensively structure
the contextual space of abstract art perception.12 My analysis of Paul Crowther’s
‘eight dimensional’ ontology is a major component in my attempts to develop an
understanding of abstract three-dimensional art, and as a consequence of this
importance, in the next section of this essay I turn my purview to the mapping
sentence for Crowther’s Ontology that I developed in the last chapter. Furthermore,
I consider the inﬂuences of the facets and their respective elements in evaluations of
three-dimensional abstract art. In doing this I attempt to specify the relationships
between the facets representing Crowther’s ontology using a partial ordering
analysis and a Hasse diagram to embody the eight facets, all of which possessed
bipolar ordered elements reﬂecting more or less of the quality contained in the facet.
I believe that potential sub-divisions of ontological dimensions may be of
importance to my research into, and subsequent writing about, using partial-order
procedures to model Crowther’s ontology. I make this claim as I will use
partial-ordered analysis of my proposed mapping sentence for Crowther’s ontology
to investigate the structure, veracity and utility of Crowther’s posited ontological
categories in their attempt to depict viewer understanding of three-dimensional
abstract art. In my earlier research, I have already discovered that the dimensions
that I will use in the Partial order analysis of three-dimensional art were pertinent in
understanding two-dimensional art (Hackett 2016). Therefore, it seems that
11However, ﬂexibility exists in the drawing of Hasse diagrams. Bruggemann and Patil (2011) have
noted that isomorphic Hasse diagrams result where the same partial order relationship is differently
drawn and represented in different Hasse diagrams.
12However, Crowther allows for possible increases in evaluative intricacy through the sub-division
of facet elements. Crowther also notes that dimensional combinations potentially exist and that
such combinations could play such an important a role in structuring the contextual space of
abstract art that the combinations should be considered to exist as separate dimensions in their own
right.

Crowther’s ontology may be appropriate but that it may need adaptation to this new
form of art. Later in this essay, I will concentrate upon a series of twelve speciﬁc
abstract three-dimensional works of art upon which I will perform a partial order
analysis. These works will be by different artists to the three example artists that
used earlier in my elemental example of the partial order process.
4.2.1
Partial Order Nomenclature
When conducting a partial ordering upon a set of items, it is important to ﬁrst
understand the concept of correspondence. Guttman (1991) notes that correspon-
dence is one of the two basic kinds of mathematical relationships that may exist
between a pair of variables.13 To illustrate correspondence we can take the state-
ment: the three-dimensional artwork is abstract. To simplify things we can, using
the nomenclature offered by Guttman (1991) where the => symbol is used to mean
corresponds,
and
write
this
statement
as
follows:
“three-dimensional
art-
work => abstract”.14 Correspondence relationships may exist between different
kinds of things where such relationships are not intrinsic to the entities in
the
relationships.15
In
the
above
correspondence:
three-dimensional
art-
work => abstract, I need to make the notation more realistic and speciﬁc by pre-
cisely deﬁning the terms under which a correspondence exists. Moreover, I will
exchange the term “three-dimensional artwork” for Richard Serra’s 5:30. Richard
Serra’s piece is an example of his early work in which Serra arranges four pieces of
four foot square, inch think, lead plate. The plates are put together so as they stand
on their edges and are propped against each other. No welds or other fastenings
physically connect the lead plates. Serra has included a single lead pole/bar laying it
across the top edges of the plates and keeping this in position by resting it at the
intersection of all slabs. The work is free standing and is kept intact only through
gravity and friction. This gives the work a somewhat precarious feeling.
If I replace the term three-dimensional artwork with the name of a speciﬁc piece
of work from this genre, namely Serra’s 5:30 I then write the correspondence in the
following manner:
5:30 ¼[ abstract
genre
13The other relationship being transivity, which I consider later in this chapter.
14Guttman’s usage of these symbols, and consequently our use of these symbols, is speciﬁc and
slightly different to its more usual meaning as a logic symbol in which instance it is taken to mean
implies.
15On the other hand, transitive relationships exist between entities of the same kind.
4.2
Partial Ordering of Crowther’s Ontology
61

I have more clearly described the relationship of the correspondence by inserting
the word genre as the term of correspondence and I can write this relationship more
precisely as:
C ¼[ A
G
C ¼ 5:30
ð
Þ
A ¼ abstract
ð
Þ
G ¼ genre
ð
Þ
This diagrammatic arrangement of terms brings together the question: “what
genre does this three-dimensional artwork posses”, with the answer “abstract”. It is
possible to answer this question due to the clear speciﬁcation of the terms of
correspondence in a manner that demonstrates the roles played by the three ele-
ments. In this example, the concept to the left of the arrow is the question’s core
object (which may also be thought of as an argument). To the right of the arrow is a
concept that forms the answer to the question (and is called the core’s image). The
speciﬁed concept is the rule by which the answer arises from the question and this
I have written below the concept. The correspondence (the question’s core) is
“this three-dimensional artwork” and the answer is “abstract”. An even stricter
denotation of correspondence is, “abstract corresponds to this three-dimensional
artwork in the sense of being the kind of genre to which the three-dimensional
artwork belongs”. From both example provided and from the example directly
below, I have speciﬁed correspondence as a structural statement involving an arrow
surrounded by three concepts.
Correspondence:
core ¼[ image
Sense
The implied question is:
What is the image that corresponds to the given core in the
given sense?
The answer:
The given image
Completing the above speciﬁcations of correspondence with the speciﬁc entries
as these apply to a particular research project can sometimes greatly assist in clearly
focussing the research question. In this current study the answers to these questions
about Serra’s 5:30 are as follows:
5:30 ¼[ abstract
is 5:30 abstract?
ð
Þ
Recipient of genre
abstract ¼[ 5:30
what genre is 5:30?

ð
Þ

ðwhat relationship exists between 5:30 and inter-item

I will now draw the reader’s attention to the fact that when describing abstract art
using everyday speech, a proliferation of possible relationships exist. In the above
six examples the three terms are shown with Richard Sierra’s 5:30 as an example.
I have also inputted the concepts of abstract and/or genre as the core in some of the
examples so that each of these two terms acts as the image at least once. The six
forms of combination that can be performed with correspondence relationships all
embody different meanings. It should also be noted that the original statement that
three-dimensional artwork is abstract is not included amongst these. When using
language in an everyday context, it is frequently the case, that there is no clear
differentiation between core image and sense. However, within the social sciences it
is important, in order to avoid ambiguity and confusion, that we explicitly and
unambiguously specify core conditions in the questions we ask. When I study
three-dimensional artworks, these objects and experiences are my core where
abstraction is the determining genre within which the three-dimensional artworks
reside.
As I have stated elsewhere (Hackett 2016), understanding the implications that
are present in correspondence are of great importance as they determine the
questions asked in a research project, the observations made and ﬁnally, the con-
clusions that may be drawn from the research.16 In the present research, I am
explicitly identifying my correspondence relationship such that the core of my
research is three-dimensional artwork and that the genre characteristics are of
abstraction. I abbreviate this as:
A 3D artwork ¼[ abstract
genre
Instead of using the terms of correspondence that I have suggested above,
I may replace these with other terms. Examples of these include: replacing genre
with age or context; abstraction replaced with ﬁgurative, portrait, etc. Regardless of
the precise changes made, by clearly understanding the complexity of the research
content area, any modiﬁcation would maintain precision in meaning. Such a

embody and display the interrelationships between complex research designs that have linked
components.

relationship forms a series of correspondences that are written in a mapping sen-
tence. In Fig. 4.1, I offer Crowther’s ontology of abstract art as the core of a series
of correspondence relationships.
In Fig. 4.1, I have followed convention as I have used a single-stemmed arrow17
to indicate that a correspondence has now become a mapping. As a consequence of
the speciﬁed mapping, a series of questions result formed by exhaustively including
single elements from the facet in each question: possible answers are then indicated
as a range of possibilities. A mapping also illustrates possible enquiries that may be
undertaken within this framework whilst specifying that a single answer may arise
for each question: this will be one of the values from within the range facet. This
relationship between question content and the response to a question is typiﬁed by
the relationship of correspondence that is established by choosing an answer (value)
from the range facet that corresponds to a particular question. In the present
research, I list the eight questions in Table 4.3.
The mapping I have proffered in Fig. 4.1, demonstrates the range of possible
answers in my research as being the three, three-dimensional artworks that are of
interest: Spiral Jetty; 5:30; Balzac. Selecting one of the three-dimensional artworks
for each of the questions and asking whether this artwork is typiﬁed by each of
Crowther’s eight speciﬁc ontological characteristics of abstraction, establishes a

correspondence between an answer and a question: a three-dimensional artwork and
a characteristic. Instead of stating whether one of Crowther’s eight characteristics is
or is not present in a three-dimensional artwork, I can achieve greater precision in
evaluations by expanding the mapping to include a range facet of extent. Under this
circumstance, I state that each of the selected three-dimensional artworks is more to
less typiﬁed by the particular characteristic.
Having considered Crowther’s ontological characteristics in terms of their cor-
respondence, I must now ask whether these characteristics possess the quality of
being transitive. In order to illustrate this concept I provide an example of transi-
tivity below. Transivity is a syllogism where the conclusions drawn are justiﬁed:
Example of transitivity:
A statue is a kind of sculpture
A sculpture is a kind of artwork
Thus; we may conclude:
A statue is a kind of artwork
An example of transitivity situated in the context of the perception of abstract art
can be found by turning from the above example to the ﬁrst facet in the mapping
sentence for Crowther’s eight characteristics (Fig. 3.5). In this example I consid-
ering Crowther’s ﬁrst dimension, which embodies notions that a given art work
embodies greater or lesser resemblance to events, states of affairs or images in the
real world. In order to demonstrate transitivity in this context I will use the same
pieces of work by Richard Serra (5:30, 1937) along with three-dimensional art-
works by Robert Smithson (Spiral Jetty, 1970) and August Rodin (Monument to
Balzac, 1892–1897).18
All of these pieces are well known and well received three-dimensional artworks
that can be clearly seen to be both abstract and representational to different extents.
I have already introduced the ﬁrst of these works by Serra. The second work is
Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty, which is a seminal, and almost clichéd or hack-
neyed example of land art. Spiral Jetty is a counter-clockwise coil shaped jetty

reaching out from the bank of the Great Salt Lake near Rozel Point, Utah. Spiral
Jetty is a land work or earthwork sculpture Smithson created in April 1970.19 The
length of the Jetty is 460 m with a width of 4.6 m constructed out of mud, salt
crystals and basalt rocks.
Both of these ﬁrst two examples of three-dimensional art can be thought of as
abstract as they do not clearly depict a thing or an event other than themselves: they
are non-ﬁgurative. The third piece of three-dimensional art that I selected, August
Rodin’s Monument to Balzac, is all together different to the other works. Auguste
Rodin created the work in memorial to the French author Honoré Balzac, and is a
representation of Balzac, a plaster cast of which was ﬁrst shown in 1898. Whilst
appearing ﬁgurative Rodin claimed that he attempted to capture the persona of his
subject rather than just display a physical approximation.
4.2.2
My Evaluations of the 3 Artworks
Having described the three artworks I now evaluate these. On my estimation I see
Spiral Jetty to be more abstract a piece of art than is 5:30. Furthermore, 5:30 is to
me obviously more abstract than Balzac. Under the conditions of transitivity the
inter-relationship between the three three-dimensional artworks in terms of what
Crowther calls resemblances (the opposite of abstractness) may be written:
Resemblances
Spiral Jetty [ 5:30;
and
5:30 [ Balzac
more abstractness
ð
Þ
more abstractness
ð
Þ
and that :
Spiral Jetty [ Balzac
ðmore abstractnessÞ
A comparison of this form, (a comparison that produces exhaustive triadic
comparisons between the three artworks), can be undertaken using all eight of the
psychological constructs speciﬁed in the characteristics of Crowther’s ontology. In
doing this, and if Crowther’s ontology adequately describes the experience of
abstract three-dimensional art, I will have produced an evaluative understanding of
this art genre. Furthermore, should Crowther’s suggestion that his ontology is
indeed comprehensive be correct, in this instance an evaluation of the three art-
works using his eight dimensions will yield a thorough understanding of the extent
of abstractness present in each of these three pieces. Such a model will also yield
knowledge regarding the differences between the three-dimensional artworks in
19As well as constructing the Spiral Jetty earthwork, Smithson also ﬁlmed its construction and the
ﬁlm exists as documentation of the process.

terms of their perceived abstractness. The above claims are largely theoretical,
however below I present the results from my using Crowther’s dimension as an
exhaustive framework to structure a sample of observations, in this example a set
evaluations of abstractness where the sample is of three three-dimensional artworks.
I presented the results of my evaluations in Table 4.4.
A numerical representation of the above relationships between the three artworks
and the eight characteristics may be provided by assigning 3, 2, 1, points to an
artwork (A, B, C) to reﬂect when I assessed the artwork as coming respectively in
ﬁrst, second or third place in terms of the relative extent to which each peace is
typiﬁed by each construct. If I then calculate total scores for each painting, the
result are the following total scores:
A ¼ 12; B ¼ 19; C ¼ 17
Another simple form of numerical analysis may be undertaken by analysing the
frequency of the number of times each artwork was positioned ﬁrst, second or third
in my assessments along the eight characteristics. This resulted in the following
proﬁles of frequencies:
A; 1st ¼ 1; 2nd ¼ 2; 3rd ¼ 5 : B; 1st ¼ 4; 2nd ¼ 3; 3rd ¼ 1 : C ;
1st ¼ 3; 2nd ¼ 3; 3rd ¼ 2:
These proﬁles may be summarised in descending order:
B; 4; 3; 1  C; 3; 3; 2  A; 1; 2; 5:
When assessing all three artworks using all eight characteristics of abstractness,
the above numerical summary proﬁles clearly demonstrate that I felt that Spiral
Jetty (B) was the most abstract of the three three-dimensional artworks, that 5:30
(C) was the second most abstract and that I rated Balzac the least abstract
three-dimensional artwork. Furthermore, a similar ordering is present in both of the
numerical proﬁle representations I listed above. From this result it is apparent that
my ratings say something about the presence of the characteristics in each of the
three three-dimensional artworks. It also seems that my assessments say much

about my personal interpretation of Crowther’s ontology and that both of these
characteristics of assessment are of great importance when attempting to understand
how I perceive and understand abstract three-dimensional art. Finally, I had little
difﬁculty assigning the artworks to Crowther’s characteristics (or vice versa). This
suggests the criteria in his ontology are appropriate for assessing abstraction as they
produce intelligible results and offer a useful account regarding when and how the
conditions are present and to allow a piece of art to be ascribed to the genre of
abstraction.
4.2.3
Three-Dimensional Abstract Art: A Partial Ordering
Thus far I have considered just three selected three-dimensional artworks. However,
from this point forward in this essay I expand my sample through the addition of
nine further three-dimensional works. I do this in order to test the discriminatory
prowess of Crowther’s characteristics and their applicability to a larger number of
works. In Table 4.5 I list the works I will be analysing, their creators and the date of
their creation.
The above twelve abstract three-dimensional artworks will be evaluated using
the characteristics present in Crowther’s eight dimensional ontology. Thus, the
artworks will be evaluated along the following dimensions:
Resemblances (Rb); Gestural Associations (GA); Revelations (Rv); Novel Environments
(NE); Neoteric Conﬁguration (NC); Visual Suggestion (VS); Spatial/Structures (SS);
Fantasy (F) →Range (R) (extant of abstraction).
In essence, I will perform POSA to test the pertinence of the above character-
istics of abstraction when viewing the selected abstract three-dimensional artworks.

The ninth term above →Range (R) is the range facet which speciﬁes the scope
across which assessments will be made. The →demonstrates that the content of
the combined characteristics feed into the Range, and that the Range is of the extent
of abstraction in each of the twelve works of three-dimensional art. If these eight
dimensions do indeed possess veracity then it is to be expected that it will be
possible to partially order evaluations of these artworks along these dimensions.
Furthermore, if these are valid dimensions for structuring the understanding of
abstraction they will appear to operate together when we perceive artworks and I
will present POSA as an account of such an amalgamated effect.20
The complexity of the psychological processes associated with perceiving
abstract three-dimensional art is exempliﬁed by the intricate eight dimensional
model forwarded by Crowther (2007). It is unlikely that all of Crowther’s eight
characteristics are perfectly ordered in relation to assessments of three-dimensional
abstract art:21 This complexity presents a challenge to my attempts to understand the
psychological processes involved the perception of three-dimensional art perception.
Let us take the eight characteristics given by Crowther that I listed above: Rb;
GA; Rv; NE; NC; VS; SS; F, (v1(Rb)…v8(F)). On Crowther’s understanding these
variables will account for how abstract three-dimensional artworks are perceived by
any set P of N observers (p1…pN). Each variable (v(Rb) … v(F)) has an ordered range
Ak = (1, 2, … αk) (k = 1 … n) (αk ≥2). 1, 2…αk are the kth variable’s categories.
Therefore, it is possible to imagine that the order of the categories 1…αk within
each range is determined by an external content variable taken from v(Rb) to v(P). In
this instance the mapping M:P →A where A = A1, A2 … An through empirical
observation assigns to each observer pi in P a proﬁle a1
(i) a2

20The following section draws heavily upon: Shye and Amar (1985).
21I earlier claimed that it seems unlikely that the complex psychological processes involved in
perceiving two-dimensional art were all perfectly ordered (Hackett 2016).
22Within the context of this essay, the scalogram may best be thought of in tandem with the notion
of Guttman scaling (or cumulative scaling). In Guttman scaling the objective is to develop a
uni-dimensional continuous measure for the concept under scrutiny. Under the rubric of a Guttman
scale, items are developed and included such that if a person agrees with a statement or item they
will have agreed with all earlier items or statements in the Guttman scale. If we are able to
construct a reliable Guttman scale then the total score a person receives on the scale will have the
following characteristic: knowledge of the score will enable researchers to tell ﬂawlessly in
advance a subjects item responses (on a perfect Guttman scale, if a person scores 7 out of ten then
it will be the ﬁrst 7 items with which the respondent agrees rather than any other combination of
item responses). In applied settings it is usual for a measure constructed as a Guttman scale to
approximate the perfect notion of this scale. Under these conditions the extent to which a set of test
items approach being a perfect Guttman scale is investigated using scalogram analysis.
A scalogram is deﬁned as “A rectangular matrix in which the columns represent items and the
rows subjects. The matrix indicates, for each subject, the category to which it belongs in each
item.” Zvulun (1978), p. 238.

I have employed Crowther’s eight dimensional ontology for differentiating the
understanding of three-dimensional abstract artworks. Earlier in this chapter I
presented three, three-dimensional works of art to demonstrate how these may be
understood in terms of their basic (ontological) components. The ﬁrst point that
arises from this presentation is that the three works considered constitute a highly
selective and restricted group of sculptures and that if three different pieces were
evaluated the results may be very different. In order to attempt to broaden the
purview of my research to a more heterogeneous collection of three-dimensional
works, for the next phase of this research I enlarged my analyses to include the
twelve selected artworks listed in Table 4.3.
The twelve pieces I have chosen are all to be found in Rosalind Krauss’ paper in
which
she
reported
her investigations
into
the
conceptual
structure
of
three-dimensional art (Krauss 1979).23 The selected pieces come mainly from the
modernist genre and are dominated by land art and installations. However, more
traditional sculpture is represented (e.g., Balzac by August Rodin) and gallery items
rather than installations (e.g., Beginning of the World by Constantin Brancusi).
I utilised the above listed twelve artworks in my research in order to mirror Krauss’
assessment. I did not introduce other pieces from other forms of three-dimensional
work from different genres as this would have introduced another source of vari-
ation in assessments.24
In an attempt to standardise the actual visual events that I was rating, the eval-
uations I performed were of images of a similar size and quality of reproduction.25

23This research is not a direct testing of Krauss’ models or claims but instead I have chosen the
same artworks as she did to permit not only the development of my own conceptual model but also
to allow comparative statements to be made between my results and hers.
24Including other forms of sculpture is beyond the remit of Crowther’s ontology in this current
research but is part of my future research.
25It is an obvious point that rating of images of three-dimensional artwork is very different to rating
the works themselves. I faced the same issue to a lesser degree in the research I conducted using a
similar assessment procedure with two-dimensional works of art (Hackett 2016). However, in this
research I felt the evaluations were meaningful and only slightly impacted upon the dimensions of
Crowther’s ontology. I will further discuss this issue later in this book.

A Partial Ordering Mereology for Non-traditional …

The images of the works were rated from 1 to 4; where a rating of 1 implied little or
none of the ontological characteristic to be present in the artwork and 4 meant that
that artwork was highly typiﬁed buy this characteristic. A rating of 2 or 3 constituted
points between these two extreme poles. I used 1–4 as the scale of assessment so that
I was forced to commit to a characteristic being present or absent to some extent
rather than taking a non-committal stance that an odd number of rating points would
have allowed. Table 4.6 presents my ratings of the twelve 3-dimensional artworks as
a proﬁle of ratings and also presents the sum of these ratings.
In my assessments of the twelve artworks I did not rate any item to be char-
acterised as possessing all of the characteristics either to the theoretical maximum or
minimum (a proﬁle of 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4 or 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 respectively). In terms of
the summated total of scores upon all of Crowther’s characteristics, the piece of
three-dimensional artworks that was least characterised by Crowther’s dimensions
was Joel Shapiro’s untitled whilst the piece most characterised by this ontology was
Perimeters/Pavilions/Decoys by Mary Miss with the respective proﬁles of 2 3 4 4 4
3 4 4 and 4 2 1 1 1 1 1 1. It is interesting to note that whilst the eight dimensions of
Crowther’s ontology were proposed by him to describe abstract artwork, the two
sculptures that were less abstract or gallery works were given ratings that located
them in 4th and 5th positions in terms of their being characterized by the dimen-
sions (4th—August Rodin—Balzac: 4 4 2 3 3 2 4 4 and 5th Constantin Brancusi—
Beginning of the World: 4 2 4 3 4 2 4 3). This ﬁnding implies that the dimensions
that Crowther proposes may equally well describe many forms of three-dimensional
art and not just abstract works and that Crowther’s dimensions should perhaps not
be used in attempting to differentiate abstract from non-abstract three-dimensional
artwork.

In Fig. 4.3 I present an example of a Hasse diagram. As I have previously
mentioned, the Hasse diagram represents both the summated (quantitative) aspects
of a proﬁle of scores along with the proﬁle’s qualitative differences (the arrange-
ment of scores on items) and these two dimensions are clearly present running top
right to bottom left (quantitative) and top left to bottom right (qualitative). As in my
earlier book (Hackett 2016) I present a Hasse diagram that depicts the visual
structure of abstract art as conceptualized using Crowther’s eight ontological
dimensions. In this analysis the Hasse diagram demonstrates the combinatorial
effects of quantitative and the qualitative assessments of abstract art, in this
instance, three-dimensional.

In Fig. 4.426 the three-dimensional artworks are plotted in terms of qualitative
and quantitative differentiations. The quantitative dimension of evaluations posi-
tions art works in terms of the quantiﬁable extent an artwork is typiﬁed by
Fig. 4.4 Hasse diagram of twelve three-dimensional artworks
26The plotting of items in a partial order scalogram analysis is always inaccurate to a certain extent.
This inaccuracy is quantiﬁed in terms of a series of metrics. For the analysis presented in Figs. 4.6
the coefﬁcients were as follows: proportion of proﬁle pairs correctly represented = 0.8352; pro-
portion of comparable pairs correctly represented = 0.8636; proportion of incomparable pairs
correctly represented = 0.8085; score—distance weighted coefﬁcient = 0.9927. When using the
POSAC an assessment of how well the plotted items are located compared to where they exist
experientially for respondents. This measure of goodness-of-ﬁt is termed CORREP; an abbrevi-
ation of ‘correctly represented’. If a POSA perfectly represented items in its plots then the
CORREP would be 1. However, this situation is unlikely in empirical social research. See Raveh
and Landau (1993) for a description of the POSA/POSAC technique and for details of when a
CORREP coefﬁcent would be expected to be 1.0. In the present research the coefﬁcients dis-
covered imply that the plot is broadly accurate with an acceptable degree of inaccuracy.

Crowther’s eight characteristics. Thus, the artwork that is characterised as pos-
sessing very little or none of Crowther’s characteristics towards the bottom left. An
artwork that is thoroughly typiﬁed by Crowther’s characteristics, that is, it pos-
sesses maximum amounts of all characteristics, is positioned at the top right of the
square ‘item plot’. As none of the twelve 3D works was rated as being
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1, (rated least on all eight of Crowther’s variables), or 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,
(rated most on all of Crowther’s dimensions) no items (3d artworks) are positioned
at either of these quantitatively extreme positions.
The second dimension present in Fig. 4.6 (a dimension that exists in all Hasse
diagrams) runs from the top left to bottom right of the plot. This is a dimension that
differentiates 3D artwork in terms of qualitative as opposed to quantitative varia-
tions in the items’ proﬁles (items are plotted ajacently if they have similar scores on
a speciﬁc element in their item proﬁle). After using these two-dimensions to
determine the relative positioning of all of the items in a Hasse analysis plot,
separate plots are then generated for each of the characteristics in the evaluation (in
our example, a plot is created for each of Crowther’s eight characteristics). In each
plot the position of each item in the analysis (in this analysis, each artwork) is
maintained, but instead of printing the identity of the item on the plot, in this
position the score the item received on that speciﬁc characteristic is printed. This
enables areas with similar scores upon a given characteristic to be clearly identiﬁed.
A Hasse diagram is shown in Fig. 4.6 in which the positions of the named twelve
individual artworks is plotted.
By producing a plot of each characteristic in an evaluation and by partitioning
areas to contain similar scores, the shape or structure of each characteristic can be
established. Straight lines are used to determine the partitioning of an item so that as
many items as is possible with a similar score are captured in an area whilst
excluding as many as possible items with a different item score. By using these
criteria, there are several permissible shapes that may be formed. Partitioning may
produce: vertical or horizontal slices; “L” shaped; inverted “L” shaped; top right to
bottom left diagonal slices; top left to bottom right partitions. If it is possible to
partition an item using one of these spatial rubrics this item is included in an overall
Hasse diagram in which all partitioning lines from all legally partitioned items are
plotted. When these linear structures are viewed in combination they provide a
structuring of the space of interest that is meaningful to respondents.
Figure 4.5 reveals how my sample of twelve abstract three-dimensional artworks
were perceived and understood by me through analysing the relative similarities and
differences in my perceptions along Crowther’s (2007) eight characteristics.
Through Partial Order Scalogram Analysis I discovered that ﬁve of Crowther’s eight
dimensions partitioned the analysis plots in a manner described above as being
legitimate or permissible. These characteristics of abstract art were: 1/ resemblances;
4/ novel environments; 6/ visually suggestions; 7/ spatiality/structure; 8/ fantasy. It
should be noted that when I attempted to partition the plot for the characteristic
74
4
A Partial Ordering Mereology for Non-traditional …

number 8/ (fantasy), I found that legitimate partitioning lines could be drawn but that
these lines resulted in several items being placed in incorrect regions.27
I was unable to partition the other 3 characteristics: 2/ gestural associations; 3/
revelations; 5/ neoteric conﬁgurations, in a way that used any of the six forms of
acceptable partitioning so as to exclusively captured single values. As a result of
this POSA I concluded that I consistently employed ﬁve of Crowther’s eight
characteristics (1,4,6,7,8) in my differentiations of the selected 12 abstract
three-dimensional artworks although characteristic 8 operated in a less deﬁnitive
manner. Furthermore, I decided that the other 3 of Crowther’s dimensions (2,3,5)
did not appear to be pertinent or to play a consistent role in how I perceived and
understood the works of art I had selected from this artistic genre for evaluation.
A quantitative axis runs from bottom left to top right of a Hasse diagram and
represents the extent of the overall degree of abstractness of the selected art
works.28 Robert Morris’ ‘Observatory’ and Richard Serra’s ‘5:30’ were located
marginally the nearest to the top right in the diagram (of the twelve assessed works)
and were understood by me to be overall the most abstract of the twelve assessed
three-dimensional artworks. Conversely, Joel Shapiro’s ‘Untitled’ was positioned
nearest to the bottom left of the diagram and I understood this three-dimensional
artwork to be characterised to the least extent by Crowther’s characteristics of
abstractness.
In Fig. 4.5 I have drawn the partitioning lines for the ﬁve characteristics of
Crowther’s ontology (1/ resemblances; 4/ novel environments; 6/ visually sugges-
tions; 7/ spatiality/structure; 8/ fantasy29) as together they legitimately partitioned
my understanding and evaluations of three-dimensional artworks. The combined
partitioning lines demonstrate how the ﬁve characteristics exercise a combined effect
upon my understanding of these pieces of art. Digits in the Hasse diagram (the
numbers 1–12 in Fig. 4.6) show where each artwork was located in terms of the
other artworks along qualitative and quantitative assessments employing the
framework of Crowther’s ontology. Figure 4.6 demonstrates how each of the art-
works is partitioned by the 5 legitimate characteristics. I have written the charac-
teristic numbers and their names around the outside edges of the diagram
demonstrating where the partitioning lines for each characteristic meets the edge of
the diagram. I have drawn a heavy-broken horizontal/diagonal line, which demon-
strates how the plot of artworks partitioned these works in terms of Crowther’s
characteristic numbers 1 (resemblance). This was the only characteristic that parti-
tioned space in this direction, which suggests that this characteristic acted in a way
that was relatively independent from the effects of the other characteristics. The

similar values for the analysis of number 8 (fantasy) this resulted in a signiﬁcant number of values
being located in partitioned regions that were dominated by other values.

diagonal from bottom left to top right is the quantitative dimension, which incor-
porates my assessment of the degree of overall abstractness of the artworks in terms
of all of Crowther’s characteristics. As the partitioning for resemblance closely
follows this quantitative dimension it is reasonable to assume that the degree to
which a three-dimensional abstract artwork resembled actual things in the non-art
world was intimately associated with my understand of the art-piece being abstract.
Three of the characteristics partitioned the Hasse diagram in the opposite
direction: almost vertically. These were the characteristics of 6, 7 and 8 (respec-
tively: visually suggestions; spatiality/structure; fantasy). The partitioning for these
three characteristics was qualitative and did not appear to be strongly associated
with overall assessments of abstractness. Furthermore, the partitioning for the three
characteristics was coincidental which suggest they play a similar role in structuring
my perceptions. There were differences however in the grades of extent that
emerged as signiﬁcant for each characteristic. Thus, I evaluated pieces in term of:

76

the 3 assessment bands of - low; medium low; medium high on visually sugges-
tiveness: the 2 assessment bands of—low; medium low to high on spatial and
structural qualities: the 3 assessment bands of - low; low medium; medium high to
high on fantasy. These three characteristics therefore appeared to play similar
although separately identiﬁable roles in assessments of three-dimensional abstract
artworks. These qualitative features embodied the senses of how:
spatial and structural aspects of a three-dimensional artwork were visually suggestive and
encouraged the use of imagination.
The ﬁnal characteristic that I found to play a consistent and legitimate role in
structuring my evaluations was that of characteristic four: novel environments. It is
perhaps not surprising that this characteristic acted in a mediating role when
compared with both the overall levels of perceived abstractness and when compared
with the qualitative characteristics of visual suggestion, spatiality and structure and
fantasy. This characteristic may be stated to mediate assessment along quantitative

77

and qualitative dimensions as the partition was found to be an “L” shape and
stretched across other forms of assessment.
Before I continue to provide an interpretation of the POSA for this research, I
must stress the following caveat. The evaluations upon which I am making the
above comments, and those that follow, result from analysing my own assessments
of the selected three-dimensional artworks. My assessments are likely to be highly
individualistic and may very well differ signiﬁcantly from any other person’s
understanding of abstract art. This fact casts severe doubts upon the extent to which
the results may be generalised from my own experiences to other individuals. I will
not delve further into this issue at this point as I consider this in detail in the next
chapter when I probe more deeply into the shortcomings of the research. However, I
note that the veracity of the POSA approach and its resulting structure are my
primary concern.
Returning to my analyses, as I have already noted, three of Crowther’s char-
acteristics (2/ gestural associations; 3/ revelations; 5/ neoteric conﬁgurations) did
not seem to play an important or consistent role in my experiential understanding of
the artworks.30 As this is the case, as these characteristics (numbers 2,3 and 5) did
not lawfully partition the diagram they play no further part in my explorations into
the qualitative proﬁles of my understanding of abstract three-dimensional art. The
Hasse diagram in Fig. 4.6 illustrates the manner in which I thought of the twelve
three-dimensional artworks using a sense of overall degree of abstractness and the
ﬁve signiﬁcant qualitative criteria.
Inspection of the three-dimensional artworks and their positions within the plots’
two-dimensions (in Fig. 4.6) demonstrates some interesting relationships. For
example, no single artwork was seen to be the most possible abstract (that is no
three-dimensional work was positioned top-right in the diagram) and most works
were positioned in the mid-range of the quantitative dimension (that runs from
bottom left to top right).
Two artists had two works in the analysis: Robert Morris and Robert Smithson.
The positioning of the two works by Morris were both seen by me to be similar in
terms of their quantitative abstractness and to also be positioned fairly closely
together. The two works by Smithson were also both seen to be of similar degrees
of quantiﬁable abstractness and both were seen as less abstract than the two works
by Morris. However, I understood Smithson’s two pieces to be more dissimilar
from each other than Morris’ two works.
30Whilst my analyses discovered ﬁve characteristics to be pertinent to my understanding of the
twelve selected works of art, it may be that the assessments I made of reproductions of the chosen
artwork lacked three-dimensional and other experiential characteristics and therefore that there is a
clearly identiﬁable dimensional based difference between the experience of looking at abstract art
“in the ﬂesh’ and in reproductions (this is true whenever a person views an artwork in a catalogue,
magazine, on a website, etc.,). This difference could easily be incorporated into a research design
by including the format of presentation as a facet of the analysis of research ﬁndings.
78

A Partial Ordering Mereology for Non-traditional …

Each of the twelve works can be understood in terms of its position on the plot
(Fig. 4.6) where each item is bounded by the lines that form the region into which
the item falls. As previously stated, the names of the regions are listed around the
perimeter of the diagram and reading the names of all regions within which an item
falls enables the item to be typiﬁed by these characteristics. For example, Carl
Andre’s Cuts (item 9 on the plot) is located in the regions that demonstrate that I
considered the work to incorporate: low visual suggestiveness (6); to possess
medium high novel environment features (4); to involve medium low fantasy in its
perception (8); to have medium low to high structural and spatial qualities (7); and
to invoke high resemblance (1). The piece was also medium in terms of its overall
abstractness (quantitative dimension).31 All other artwork may be considered in this
way.
4.3
Conclusions
In conclusion to these analyses, it is important to comment upon the fact that POSA
was able to legitimately partition most of Crowther’s (ﬁve out of eight) charac-
teristics of three-dimensional art: This suggests that these ﬁve characteristics were
pertinent in structuring my understanding of this genre of abstract art.
In reference to issues surrounding scale construction (for example the devel-
opment of a Guttman or cumulative scale), the results I have presented above
tentatively suggest that the ﬁve pertinent characteristics offered by Crowther may
usefully
be
employed to
design
research
into
the
experience
of
abstract
three-dimensional ﬁne art. These ﬁve of his characteristics are: 1/ resemblances; 4/
novel environments; 6/ visually suggestions; 7/ spatiality/structure; 8/ fantasy. This
statement arises from and is supported by the analyses I performed of my evalu-
ations of the twelve selected artworks, which yielded legitimate and consistent
partitioning for these characteristics through Partial Order Scalogram Analysis.
Consequently, these characteristics appear to constitute “viewer meaningful”
features, aspects or characteristics of abstract three-dimensional art that could be
employed in the design of research instruments (such as the development of
Guttman Scale survey questions) that are meaningful to participants. Prior to using
the ﬁve characteristics further research is needed to assess the pertinence of the
characteristics to a representative respondent sample. By using characteristics that
are the ones that respondents actually employ in their perceptions and under-
standing of this kind of art, the results from such a survey are more likely to reﬂect
respondents’
own
understandings
of
the
artwork
rather
than
assessments
31It should be kept in mind that all of these statements are relative to the other eleven
three-dimensional works incorporated in the analysis. If other items were assessed with Andre’s
Cuts then it is likely that the positioning of this item on all of the characteristics would be different
to its present location.

constituting an evaluation of characteristics that the researcher has imposed upon
individuals who are completing the questionnaire.32
In the ﬁfth and ﬁnal chapter of this book I further consider the implications of the
ﬁndings of my research. This evaluation includes addressing the similarities and
differences between my assessments of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
abstract art and the possibility of a generic understanding of abstract art
assessments.33

Conclusions—The Perceptual Structure
of Abstract Artwork
Abstract Up until this point in this book I have reviewed previous research and
thinking in the area of perception as this relates to how we understand and perceive
art. I have singled out the philosophical writing of Paul Crowther as being espe-
cially pertinent to my research. I then presented the ﬁndings of my own research
into the characteristics I used to evaluate and understand twelve pieces of abstract
three-dimensional abstract art. In this concluding chapter I summarise the ﬁndings
from my research, make positive claims regarding theory development and I also
offer caveats. I compare and contrast the ﬁndings from my research into the per-
ception of two- and three-dimensional art and provide suggestions as to the
direction of future research. I conclude that the structural model that I have
developed may be thought of as a meta-ontological and meta-mereological account
of the experience of abstract three-dimensional art.

Introduction
The experiential world in which we reside is a highly complex place and in an attempt
to make it easier to understand such intricacy, we often divide experiences into
smaller sized units. Philosophers from ancient and classical eras were well versed in
sub-dividing the world and they developed ontologies or accounts of the most basic
sub-divided elements of existence [see for example: Aristotle and Ackrill (1975);
Harte (2002)]. Philosophers have continued to propose ontological accounts through
until, and including, the present day [see for examples of more recent ontologies:

Chisholm (2010); Lowe (2007); Poli and Seibt (2010); Sider (2005); Simons (1987);
and for a general contemporary review see: Coffey (2016)].1 In this essay I have
presented a structured ontological/mereological evaluation of a hermeneutically
consistent account that I propose may be achieved through using a mapping sentence
to investigate perceptions of abstract three-dimensional art.2 Furthermore, I claim
both in this essay and elsewhere (Hackett 2016a) that the presence in an ontology of
the seminally important features of theoretical and empirical validity are the probable
outcome when using a mapping sentence approach during research development and
in the interpretation of results that arise from research designed in this way.
These assertions will encounter little opposition from researchers who have used
facet theoretical approaches in their quantitative psychological and behavioural
research with resulting structural consistency. My present research demonstrates
that a hermeneutically consistent structural ontology results from using a mapping
sentence representation of the ontological components and the mereological rela-
tionships between these ontological sub-units in a research project. As in much of
the research I have reported in earlier publications (see for example: Hackett 1995,
2014, 2016b) the current analyses have demonstrated that reliable and valid ﬁnd-
ings may result for philosophical, qualitative and indeed traditional quantitative
research projects that embrace a facet theory perspective. In this book I have put
forward such a facet theory understanding of three-dimensional art experience.

psychological/visual impact is presented in Pelowski et al. (2016).3 In their article
Pelowski and colleagues note that over the last 15 years there has been an increase
in empirical and psychological research into art and the research I report upon in
this book and much of my earlier work is embraced by these claims. Interestingly,
they assert that this growth is particularly apparent in cognitive models of the
experiential process of our engagement with art: my cognitive model speciﬁcally
offers a partial ordering of Crowther’s (2007) process ontology and I now consider
the future possibilities of this model.
1Over the preceding century the practice of forming ontological understandings has also been
taken-up by psychologists. It should also be noted that the in-depth philosophical study of
ontology is not part of my usage of ontology. Rather, I am concerned with the ways in which basic
accounts are formed of a given subject domain and how a particular ontological structure can aid in
our interpretation of an individuals understanding.
2Hermeneutic consistency is a state that may be accorded to the interpretation of a data set when
the behaviour under scrutiny is interpreted in a manner that is considered to yield consistent
meaning (i.e., meaning that is robust across different situations and times).
3The interested reader is guided to the earlier seminal work on categorial models of art by Walton
(1970).

Conclusions—The Perceptual Structure of Abstract Artwork

5.2
A Partial Ordering of Abstract Art
In Hackett (2016b) I selected nine abstract paintings that included works from
different types of modernist painting: To make my assessments more focussed I
restricted the paintings to this one genre. I assessed all of these paintings upon the
same eight characteristics taken from Crowther’s ontology that I used in this essay
to evaluate three-dimensional artwork. I also employed a similar assessment pro-
cedure to the one I used in the present research whereby I rated images of the nine
paintings on a scale. Ratings ran between the extremes of 1 which indicated little of
this ontological characteristic was seen to be present in that painting and where 4
meant a great deal of this characteristic was assessed as being present in the
painting. Analysis of these ratings were also through POSA and took into account
both quantitative (summated rating score) in order to position paintings in plots
whilst also considering qualitative differences (proﬁle differences) in determining
an artwork’s location in a plot.
I clarify the relationships between the characteristics that partitioned evaluations
of two- and three-dimensional art by presenting these in Table 5.1. In this table I
show that there were six characteristics that could be partitioned for my appreci-
ation
of two-dimensional
works and four
or ﬁve
characteristics
for
the
three-dimensional works.
5.3
Evaluative Structure of Two-dimensional Artwork
Table 5.1 demonstrates the rating characteristics that were pertinent in both of my
assessments and I elaborate upon these in the following pages. After I had per-
formed POSA upon my assessments of two-dimensional abstraction I found six of
Crowther’s characteristics partitioned the plots qualitatively and quantitatively in a
legitimate manner.4 The characteristics that legally partitioned my understanding
were of:
1. resemblances: joining, connecting or uniting in an advantageous or rewarding
way, colours, shapes and textures in such a fashion so that these resemble certain
speciﬁed visual conﬁgurations and shapes (e.g., images in cloud patterns)
2. gestural associations: symbolic relationships and connections with visual mani-
festations that summon up states of mind (i.e., violent shapes, depressing colours)
3. revelations: aspects of articles, objects, associations, tiny small surface features,
internal conﬁgurations, ﬂeeting atmospheric effects, unusual perspectives, and
other events that are not usually visible
4See earlier in this text for a description of the legitimate ways in which to partition items in partial
order analyses.

4. novel environments: articles, objects, associations and other events, located in
perceptual and physical environments that they are not usual found in there
6. visually suggestions: previous, future or counterfactual events, items or states of
affairs arising from visual lines, colours, shapes, symbols, etc.
7. spatiality/structure: visual spatial impression and conﬁguration of attributes,
such as colour, shape, volume, mass, texture, density, geometric structure,
alterations in positions, either alone or in combination

Conclusions—The Perceptual Structure of Abstract Artwork

Two of Crowther’s characteristics (ﬁve and eight) did not partition areas that
exclusively captured single identities (single proﬁle scores) under any of the six
forms of acceptable partitioning:
5. neoteric conﬁgurations: the bringing about of a visual array, positioning or
arrangement through destruction, deconstruction, reduction, reconstruction or in
some way altering familiar events
8. fantasy: a state of unreality or hallucinatory circumstances and appearances
I conclude that when I viewed the modernist paintings or drawings I was dis-
cerning or appreciating little of what may be termed dreamlike qualities or novel
re-conﬁgurations of the familiar. All of the other characteristics that Crowther
suggested as pertinent to understanding abstract artwork were relevant to my
assessments. I have attempted to deﬁne and explain what each of the assessment
characteristics means through reference to Crowther’s writing. However, exactly
what I mean by each of the characteristics is very personal and for comments to be
made about the universality, or otherwise, of my appraisals may only be answered
after undertaking an assessment procedure with other viewers of artworks.
5.4
Evaluative Structure of Three-dimensional Artwork
I discovered four/ﬁve pertinent characteristics structured my assessments in relation
to three-dimensional art. These were:
1. resemblances: joining, connecting or uniting in an advantageous or rewarding
way, colours, shapes and textures in such a fashion so that these resemble
certain speciﬁed visual conﬁgurations and shapes (e.g., images in cloud
patterns)
4. novel environments: articles, objects, associations and other events, located in
perceptual and physical environments that they are not usual found in
6. visually suggestions: previous, future or counterfactual events, items or states of
affairs arising from visual lines, colours, shapes, symbols, etc., or suggestions
7. spatiality/structure: visual spatial impression and conﬁguration of attributes,
such as colour, shape, volume, mass, texture, density, geometric structure,
alterations in positions, either alone or in combination
One further characteristic captured items in a slightly less exclusive manner
when boundaries were drawn on plots in a permissible format and may therefore be
seen to have a slightly less clear role in structuring evaluations of artworks. This
semi-legitimate characteristic was:
8. fantasy: a state of unreality or hallucinatory circumstances and appearances
The ﬁrst interesting point that here arises is that characteristic 5 of novel rear-
rangements of the familiar did not appear pertinent to my ratings of either two- or
5.3
Evaluative Structure of Two-dimensional Artwork
85

three-dimensional artwork. Therefore, I may disregard this characteristic in attempts
to understand my assessments. Furthermore, my evaluations of both art forms were
little inﬂuenced by characteristic 8 of dreamlike unreality. However, this charac-
teristic is still to some extent pertinent and worthy of further enquiry. Characteristic
2: gestural associations, and characteristic 3: revelations both legitimately parti-
tioned my understanding of two-dimensional abstraction but did not partition my
evaluations of the three-dimensional form of this art genre. These ﬁrst of these two
characteristics is concerned with emblematic associations with our perceptions
through the evocation of violent shapes, depressing colours, etc. From this
description it is not surprising that this was pertinent to my two-dimensional but not
my three-dimensional evaluations. Characteristic 3 embodied aspects of the artwork
such as small surface features, internal conﬁgurations, ﬂeeting atmospheric effects,
unusual perspectives, and other events that are not usually visible. From this
description of characteristic 3 it is not seem immediately apparent why this char-
acteristic failed to legitimately partition my assessments of two-dimensional art,
although this may relate to my appraisals were of photographs of works of art rather
than the works themselves.
My comparison between the results of two- and three-dimensional art leads me
now to consider the possibility of the existence of a more universal or generic set of
characteristics that may be used to understand abstract art experiences.
5.5
A Possible General Partial Ordering for Abstract Art?
In my earlier book (Hackett 2016b) I presented research that was very similar to the
research I have presented in this book. The similarity is due to the methodological
approach, design and analyses I performed. However, the subject matter of the
earlier research was two-dimensional abstract art as opposed to three-dimensional
works from this art genre in the current essay. In the preceding pages I have
therefore been able to directly compare the results of using a more qualitative and
philosophical research approach that is guided by the employment of mapping
sentences and partial order scalogram analyses.
Table 5.1 demonstrates that there are both differences and similarities between
how I understood different kinds of artistic abstraction. The similarities are of
particular interest as they allow me to consider an experiential model for a more
generally conceived abstract act that is based upon common ontological and
mereological characteristics. I employed four/ﬁve of the eight characteristics in my
evaluations of both two- and three-dimensional art, which were:
1. resemblances: joining, connecting or uniting in an advantageous or rewarding
way, colours, shapes and textures in such a fashion so that these resemble
certain speciﬁed visual conﬁgurations and shapes (e.g., images in cloud
patterns)
86

Conclusions—The Perceptual Structure of Abstract Artwork

2. gestural associations: symbolic relationships and connections with visual man-
ifestations that summon up states of mind (i.e., violent shapes, depressing
colours)
5. neoteric conﬁgurations: the bringing about of a visual array, positioning or
arrangement through destruction, deconstruction, reduction, reconstruction or in
some way altering familiar events
6. visually suggestions: previous, future or counterfactual events, items or states of
affairs arising from visual lines, colours, shapes, symbols, etc.
7. spatiality/structure: visual spatial impression and conﬁguration of attributes,
such as colour, shape, volume, mass, texture, density, geometric structure,
alterations in positions, either alone or in combination
These ﬁve characteristics appear to be more pervasive in their presence as
evaluatory characteristics and constitute features of a more broadly deﬁned
understanding of abstract art.
However, the presence of partitioning for characteristics 2 and 3 in my
two-dimensional assessments but their absence of allowable partitioning for my
three-dimensional assessments would suggest the following: That, some charac-
teristics
are
pertinent
to
my
assessments
of
two-dimensional
but
not
three-dimensional abstract artwork and that the pertinence of a characteristic may
be ﬁrmly related to an individual rater’s understanding of the characteristic and its
relationship to the artworks. These two claims suggest a ﬂexibility to be present in
Crowther’s ontology. This is also the case of characteristic 8, fantasy and dreamlike
features, which was more inﬂuential in my considerations of three- rather than
two-dimensional pieces of art. This may relate to the speciﬁc form of
three-dimensional art that I assessed: land art. This type of work is heavily laden
with evocative relationships with ‘other-worlds’ or with hallucinatory qualities.
When the ﬁve legitimate characteristics are included in a mapping sentence, the
structural ontology formed by these characteristics depicts these characteristics in
such a way that suggests a more sophisticated understanding. Furthermore, the
mapping sentence in Fig. 5.1 facilitates the mereological interaction of the pertinent
characteristics in relation to perceiving and understanding all forms of abstract art.
The mapping sentence above suggests a structure for designing original research
and for re-analysing existing ﬁndings of studies that have viewed art experience. By
using this mapping sentence to guide research it may be possible to develop a
greater understanding of the role of Crowther’s characteristics on their own and in
combination in viewers’ understanding of abstract art.
5.5.1
Caveats and Future Research
Scholars spend a lot of their time engaging in attempts to reveal facts and regu-
larities within the areas of their expertise. It is also often the case that when artists
and art critics write about art, they frequently do so in attempts to disclose, describe

and substantiate features and theories about art and art related phenomena.
However, due perhaps to the free form and unstructured nature of art, and the oft
claimed subjective and idiographic experience of art, propositions of what consti-
tutes the substantive features of artwork are problematic. Moreover, there are dif-
ﬁculties in elucidating how art practice and art appreciation may relate to any
concrete aspects of artworks and how distinct aspects of pieces of art may
be spoken about in terms that allow these accounts to be reliable or accurate
descriptions of art experiences.
Sometimes, we may express denigrating comments towards artists and critics
with whom we do not share agreement over their assessment of a given artwork. In
addition, there is a tendency in our society to hold the beliefs that art is beyond any
formal understanding and that attempts to develop rigorous knowledge about art in

Conclusions—The Perceptual Structure of Abstract Artwork

some way lessens or degrades the artwork and our experiences of art. Along with
these beliefs we (as individuals) may state that we know what art we like and do not
like, that we do not need academic or critical evaluations of art and that formal
understandings of art are at best irrelevant and at worst they are aesthetically
destructive.5
If we understand our own individual theories of art experience to be ostensibly
correct and that knowledge of about art may best be understood individualistically,
the above beliefs are especially calumnious to the prospects of developing anything
more than an impressionistic appreciation of art: On these assumptions, we
over-estimate our cognitive and affective understanding. These beliefs also impel us
to assume that we as individuals possess a non-scientiﬁc, non-formal, art intuition
that enables us to access the necessary information required for us to appreciate art.
The perhaps inevitable consequence of holding such dispositions is the call to reject
attempts to understand art through formal, logical or scientiﬁc means. In this text, I
depart from a substantial proportion of these assumptions and claims. Of greater
importance and relevance than my simple disagreement with these statements are
my suggestions that I offer to uphold my divergence. I maintain that there is no
deﬁnitive reason for supposing our individual beliefs to be more than simply our
personal accounts of our experiences and that these are only useful to others if they
are broadly similar to other people’s beliefs. Consequently I have proposed a model
for understanding the perception of art.
However, it seems reasonable to state that we do indeed have attitudes and belief
types about what constitutes art and that we understand as being art. Thus, it is
possible to consider that we have art intuitions. These enable us to discern, describe
and separate those experiences that we consider art related from our non-art related
encounters and to differentiate art experiences. In this essay I have proffered a
formal and rigorous structure for art intuitive experiences.6
In this essay I claim that a formal perceptual understanding of artworks neces-
sitate a representation of art objects and concepts within the domain of a speciﬁc art
encounter. Furthermore, this understanding must be as experientially accurate as
possible. In addition, the activity of theorising about art is best served by attempting
to structure our logical conceptions regarding art in a manner that enables knowl-
edge development. If I acknowledge a speciﬁc theory about art to be useful this
does not necessarily cause me to alter my understanding of what art is like. Rather,
the incorporation of this theory expands the possible ways in which I may discover
5The belief that a formalisation of art theory, practice or appreciation can be developed runs
counter to the widely held belief that art is in someway mystic, an act of genius that cannot be
logically understood. Jessica Schwarzenbach and I mention this in Schwarzenbach and Hackett
(2015). The thinking and writing of Benacerraf (1973) has informed my work in this area.
6I am using the term art intuition not in any exact sense. I am in no way claiming that the model I
offer is truly intuitive in its nature. Rather, I employ the phrase art intuition simply, and in a highly
restrictive way, to imply a sub-conscious and somewhat encompassing psychological quality.
Holding such an outlook implies and necessitates that formal thinking about artwork should be
understood and analysed using attitudes that imply a belief about artworks.

89

and experience the qualities that constitute art. On my perspective, to decide that a
given artwork is mediocre does not imply taking a position on what art is like or
what it is. Understanding art is not concerned with establishing facts about art
experience. Instead, understanding art is concerned with the ways in which we
encounter art and what we do when we encounter art. A formal understanding of art
experience does not imply the establishment of facts about art but rather this
cognitive and affective structure (understanding) allows us to occupy a space of
theories and hypotheses about art.
In this essay my position causes me to explain how it is possible that we can
relate to some assertions about art and to intimate possible commonalities in art
experience. I contend that this account should not and does not establish art
experience as being rooted in mystery but rather employs the interests and skills
that we may have and use to engage in or with art. Thus, my perspective on art
experience is functionalist in the sense that my theorising about art has a goal of
elucidating unembellished regularities about these experiences. Attempting to
develop a factualist view about art experience may seem counterintuitive as art is,
as I have already implied, is often seen as perhaps the exemplary paradigm of a
non-rationally determined and inﬂuence activity.7
It seems to be necessary that any sensible or useful explanation of how we
engage in and understand art must elucidate how our theorizing about art is
experientially bound. Furthermore, as the experience of art resides in neural pro-
cesses that are similar to our experience of other non-art phenomena, both in terms
of meaning and perception, the constraints to our theories should probably emerge
from a putative domain of broader perceptual understanding.
When reading this book, perhaps the single greatest caveat that must kept in
mind is in regard to any attempts to generalise these research ﬁndings as the study I
have presented is a case study where the evaluations were made by a single person.
Another and important source of bias is due to the fact that I was the sole individual
to rate the artworks and to analyse and interpret these evaluations. Furthermore, the
twelve selected three-dimensional artworks were not chosen in any attempt to be
either random or to portray abstract art of art in any form of representative sense.
The twelve pieces were the works Rosalind Kraus used in her 1979 book and the
artworks were all of a speciﬁc kind: land art. What I have produced is not the end
point in understanding how we experience abstract art. I hope instead that through
the incorporation of Crowther’s characteristics within a mapping sentence and
through the use of POSA I have suggested a model to guide future explorations into
how we engage with art abstraction. Moreover, I believe that this model may be
adapted to address a variety of art types and genres. Not withstanding my caveats,
by using theoretically grounded empirical research, I have succeeded in producing
partial support for Crowther’s characteristics of abstract art and I have proposed that
there is some redundancy amongst his categories.
7It is my contention that art must necessarily be evaluated against an arena of independent facts in
order to explain and facilitate the process of theorizing about art experiences.
