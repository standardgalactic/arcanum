PREFACE
The overall content, approach and layout of this second edition 
of the Indonesian Reference Grammar is essentially unchanged 
from the ﬁ rst edition published by James Sneddon in 1996. The 
only major addition we have made is a short section on orthog-
raphy and pronunciation outlining how these differ from the 
orthography and pronunciation of English. We have also made 
various editorial changes in an attempt to clarify some of the 
original explanations and formulations provided in the ﬁ rst 
edition. While maintaining the general order and organisation 
of the material, in our analysis of speciﬁ c grammatical issues 
we have sometimes used a different approach (for instance, 
in our presentation of ada, pun, kurang, bahwa and personal 
pronouns).
In some instances we have changed sample sentences to ones 
that we feel more accurately or clearly illustrate the point at hand. 
Although the focus is still clearly on standard Indonesian, in 
recognition of on-going changes occurring in Indonesian usage 
our explanations and our choice of alternative sample sentences 
occasionally include contractions that might have been class-
iﬁ ed as informal previously, but which are now becoming more 
prevalent—even when speakers are using the standard language. 
We have also replaced sample sentences containing out-dated 

xviii Preface
references with updated or less time-speciﬁ c sentences. We 
have, however, retained and identiﬁ ed some examples of older 
grammatical usage, as such forms are still encountered from 
time to time.

GLOSSARY OF 
GRAMMATICAL TERMS
The following terms are deﬁ ned as used in this grammar of 
Indonesian. Some terms may be used in other ways in grammars 
of either Indonesian or English. Terms mentioned in this work 
to refer only to English grammar are not included in the 
glossary. 
abilitative verb A verb with preﬁ x ter- which indicates that the 
actor has the ability to perform the action.

trolled action. Depending on the particular verb and the 
context it may refer to action which is unintended, unex-
pected, agentless, involuntary or sudden.
action noun A noun which refers to an action. Such nouns 
frequently have afﬁ xation peN-...-an and can be followed by 
an attributive noun.
active clause See active voice.
active voice The form of transitive clause in which the subject 
refers to the one who performs the action (the actor) and in 
which the verb is marked by preﬁ x meN-.

passive clause, which is optionally marked by oleh ‘by’: Saya 
ditolong (oleh) Ali ‘I am helped by Ali’.
adjective A word which refers to a characteristic of a person or 
thing, such as besar ‘big’, hijau ‘green’.

Adjuncts which refer to manner are called adverbs. See also 
sentence adjunct.
adverb See adverb of manner or modifying verb.
adverb of manner An adjunct which gives information about 
the manner in which an action is performed.
afﬁ x A sound or group of sounds added to a word base to 
produce a derived word. Depending on where they occur

sometimes follows the preposition oleh ‘by’.
apposition The placing of one noun or noun phrase after an-
other to give more information about it, as in Ola, suaminya

base The part of a word which carries the essential meaning and 
to which afﬁ xes are attached, such as jalan in berjalan ‘walk’ 
and perjalanan ‘journey’. A base cannot be broken down 
into smaller units. Words are listed under their base in a 
dictionary.
basic clause An independent clause which is described without

such as satu ‘one’, dua ‘two’, tiga ‘three’.
circumﬁ x An afﬁ x which has two parts, one occurring before 
the base and the other occurring after the base, such as 
per-...-an in perjalanan ‘journey’.
classiﬁ er A word which precedes a noun to place it in a particu-
lar class, such as ekor with names of animals, as in dua ekor 
ular ‘two snakes’.

‘Ratna is able to swim’.
complement verb The verb in a complement, contrasted with 
the main verb, such as berbicara ‘speak’ in Ibu mulai berbi-
cara ‘Mother began to speak’.
complex sentence A sentence which consists of more than a 
single clause.
complex word A word which consists of more than a single base 
standing alone. The word perjalanan ‘journey’ is complex 
because it contains circumﬁ x per-...-an as well as base jalan.

grammatical type which are of equal importance. They are 
usually linked by a coordinator.

or structures of equal importance. Also called coordinating 
conjunction when linking two clauses.
copula A word which occurs optionally between the subject and 
predicate in non-verbal clauses. The copulas are adalah and 
ialah.
correlative structures Two clauses, phrases or words which 
are dependent on each other, such that neither can 
occur alone. Usually each of the units is introduced by a 
conjunction or adverb, such as the two clauses in Dia begitu 
gembira, sehingga dia menangis ‘He was so happy that he 
cried’.
count noun A noun which refers to something which can be 
counted, such as buku ‘book’. See also non-count noun.

Glossary of grammatical terms xxiii

embedding phrase. It is preceded by yang, as in Orang yang 
duduk di situ ‘The person who is sitting there’.
deﬁ nite number A number which is or includes a speciﬁ c 
unit, such as satu ‘one’, sepuluh ‘ten’, occurring either as a 
cardinal number or in some other combination, such as in

as a subordinate clause (which combines with another clause) 
or a relative clause (which occurs within a phrase).
derivational affix An affix which, when attached to a base, 
changes the word to another class, or derives another 
class. Thus, when -an is suffixed to the verb base pakai 
‘wear’ it derives a noun, pakaian ‘clothes’. See also inflec-
tional affix.
derived clause A clause which is best described with reference to 
a basic clause. It can be either independent, such as a topic-

one says, such as Dia berkata, ‘Terima kasih’ ‘He said, 
“Thank you”’.
direct speech See direct quote.

to a word or phrase, usually by placing it earlier in a sentence 
than it normally occurs.

whether simple, such as buku-buku ‘books’, or complex, 
such as perubahan-perubahan ‘changes’.

highlighting See foregrounding.
honoriﬁ c A form used to show respect. The word sang is an 
honoriﬁ c.

placed ﬁ rst for highlighting and whose subject is a nomin-
alised relative clause, such as Wayang kulit lah yang paling 
kami gemari ‘It is the wayang kulit that we most admire’.
imitative reduplication Reduplication in which the two parts of 
the word are similar but not identical, such as sayur-mayur

mood. Imperatives range from strong commands to requests, 
appeals and suggestions.

‘When will he move?’ becomes an indirect question in Saya 
tidak tahu kapan dia akan pindah ‘I don’t know when he 
will move’.
inﬁ x An afﬁ x which occurs immediately after the ﬁ rst consonant 
of a base. Inﬁ xation is not productive in modern Indo nesian, 
although a few fossilised forms remain, such as -em- in 
gemetar ‘tremble’ (cf. getar ‘vibrate’).
inﬂ ectional afﬁ x An afﬁ x which does not change the class of the

preceded by tempat or di mana ‘where’ rather than by yang, 
such as (pabrik) tempat/di mana mereka bekerja ‘(the 
factory) where they work’.

a subordinate clause or complement. It is called the main 
verb to distinguish it from the verb in the complement or 
sub ordinate clause.
measurement noun A noun which refers to size, distance,

rice’.
modal A word in the predicate which refers to concepts like 
possibility, ability and necessity, such as dapat ‘can’ and

sentence. The four moods recognised here are statements, 
questions, orders (imperatives) and exclamations.

xxviii Glossary of grammatical terms
negation Turning a construction into a negative by adding to it 
one of the negative words. See negative.
negative A word, sometimes also called a negative word, which 
negates a construction. The major negatives are tidak ‘not’, 
bukan ‘not’, jangan ‘don’t’, belum ‘not yet’. The term is also 
used to refer to a construction which is negated, that is, 
which contains a negative. Thus a clause containing tidak is 
a negative clause.
nominalisation Turning a word or construction into a noun.
nominalised adjective of measure An adjective of measure 
which is used as a noun, such as berat ‘heavy’ in berat saya 
‘my weight’. See also adjective of measure.
nominalised clause A clause acting as a noun.
nominalised relative clause A relative clause which takes the 
place of a noun when the noun it would usually follow is 
omitted. Thus the relative clause yang biru in the noun 
phrase mobil yang biru itu ‘that blue car’ is nominalised 
when mobil ‘car’ is omitted, as in Yang biru itu mobil saya 
‘That blue one is my car’.
non-count noun A noun which refers to something which 
cannot be counted, such as air ‘water’, gula ‘sugar’. 
noun A word which refers to a person, thing or abstract 
concept.
noun clause A clause whose predicate centre is a noun, such as 
Dia guru ‘He is a teacher’. The negative in a noun clause is 
bukan.
noun complement A complement which is a noun. Thus, 
menjadi ‘become’ has as a complement the noun presiden 
in Dia menjadi presiden ‘He became president’.
noun phrase A sequence of words which functions in the same 
way as a noun (for instance, as the subject or object of a 
clause) and which has a noun as its head word. For example, 
guru baru itu ‘that new teacher’ whose head noun is guru 
‘teacher’.
nuclear component A word or phrase which is obligatory to 
a particular clause type. A predicate is nuclear to all clause 
types. Most clauses also require a subject and some must 
have an object or a complement. Components of a clause 
which are not nuclear are called adjuncts.

Glossary of grammatical terms xxix
number pronoun One of a limited number of deﬁ nite or indef-
inite numbers which can stand alone in place of a noun, such 
as keduaduanya ‘both of them’ and semuanya ‘all of them’.
object The noun or noun phrase which occurs immediately 
after an active transitive verb. It usually indicates the patient 
of the action but with some verbs it identiﬁ es the beneﬁ ciary, 
recipient or location. The object noun phrase corresponds to 
the subject in passive sentences.
object complement A complement which follows the object 
in a transitive clause. The object usually stands as subject 
of the object complement. In the following construction 
the object complement is pergi ‘go’; anaknya ‘his child’ is 
simul taneously object of the main verb and subject of the 
comp lement: Dia menyuruh anaknya pergi ‘He ordered his 
child to go’.
object topic-comment clause A topic-comment clause whose 
topic corresponds to the object in the basic clause from 
which it is derived. In the following object topic-comment 
clause the topic is surat itu ‘that letter’: Surat itu, saya belum 
menerimanya ‘(As for) that letter, I haven’t received it yet’.
object topic-comment relative clause A topic-comment 
relative clause whose topic derives from the object of a basic 
clause, its place in the original clause being marked by -nya, 
as in senjata yang tidak setiap musuh bisa menghadapinya 
‘weapons which not every enemy can face’.
ordinal number A number which indicates where something 
comes in a sequence and has the preﬁ x ke-, such as kedua 
‘second’, kelima ‘ﬁ fth’.
parataxis The coordination of two units without use of a 
co ordinator, such as the two clauses in rumahku hancur, 
sapiku mati ‘my house was destroyed, my cattle were dead’.
partial reduplication This involves placing before the base a 
syllable consisting of the ﬁ rst consonant of the base followed 
by e, such as leluhur ‘ancestor’, based on luhur ‘noble’. 
This type of reduplication occurs only with bases which 
begin with a consonant and is no longer productive in the 
language.

xxx Glossary of grammatical terms
participant One of the semantic relationships involved in an 
event and expressed by a noun phrase standing as subject, 
object and so on. Important participants include the actor, 
which is marked as subject in an active clause and as agent in 
a passive clause, and the patient, which is marked as object 
in an active clause.
partitive A word which precedes a noun to indicate a particu-
lar amount. Partitives, such as bungkus ‘packet’ and piring 
‘plate’, are usually preceded by a number, as in dua bungkus 
rokok ‘two packets of cigarettes’ and sepiring nasi ‘a plate 
of rice’.
passive type one A passive clause in which the verb has preﬁ x 
di and the agent is indicated by a phrase following the verb, 
sometimes marked by the preposition oleh ‘by’, such as Surat 
itu ditulis oleh Ali ‘That letter was written by Ali’. It can 
only occur if the agent is third person, except with ter- and 
ke-...-an verbs, in which a passive construction is always 
passive type one.
passive type two A passive clause in which the verb has no preﬁ x 
and the agent precedes the verb, such as Surat itu saya tulis 
‘That letter was written by me’. The agent phrase must be a 
pronoun.
passive voice The form of transitive clause in which the subject 
refers to the patient. The actor, if mentioned, is expressed by 
an agent phrase. The verb is marked by preﬁ x di- (passive 
type one) or has no preﬁ x (passive type two).
patient The participant which is moved or affected by the 
action (also called the goal). It occurs as object in most active 
clauses, such as Ali in Mereka menolong Ali ‘They help Ali’. 
It occurs as subject in the passive of such constructions: Ali 
ditolong oleh mereka ‘Ali is helped by them’. With ditran-
sitive verbs the patient can occur as the secondary object. 
Thus, the patient uang ‘money’ occurs as secondary object 
in Saya memberi dia uang ‘I give him money’.
person One of three classes of people involved in what is said; ﬁ rst 
person refers to the person speaking, such as saya ‘I’, second 
person refers to the person being spoken to, such as kamu ‘you’, 
and third person refers to the person or thing being spoken 
about, such as mereka ‘they’ and orang itu ‘that person’.

Glossary of grammatical terms xxxi
personal pronoun A pronoun which refers to a person who has 
already been mentioned or is otherwise clear from context, 
such as saya ‘I’, mereka ‘they’.
phrase A group of words which is grammatically equivalent 
to a single word, being able to occur in the same places as 
that word. The phrase is built around a head word, which 
is a member of the class to which the phrase is equivalent. 
For instance, a noun phrase such as anak kecil itu ‘that 
little chile’ is built around a noun, anak ‘child’. Prepositional 
phrases and predicate phrases have a different structure.
phrase head See head word.
possessive noun A noun which follows another noun to indicate 
the possessor. See also possessor.
possessive pronoun A pronoun which follows a noun to 
indicate the possessor. See also possessor.
possessor A term which covers a number of semantic relation-
ships which stand between a noun or pronoun and a 
preceding noun. Depending on the context it may mark the 
owner or possessor (rumah saya ‘my house’), or some other 
connection, such as originator or creator (Iukisan Monet 
‘Monet’s painting’), or a family or social relationship (ayah 
Torno ‘Torno’s father’).
possessor topic-comment clause A topic-comment clause whose 
topic corresponds to the possessor in the basic clause from 
which it derives. In the following possessor topic-comment 
clause the topic is sopir itu, the possessor of nama ‘name’: 
Sopir itu, namanya Ali ‘(As for) that driver, his name is Ali’.
possessor topic-comment relative clause A topic-comment 
relative clause whose topic corresponds to the possessor in the 
basic clause from which it derives and which means ‘whose’, 
as in sopir yang namanya Ali ‘the driver whose name is Ali’.
predicate The part of a clause which says something about the 
subject. The predicate centre contains a word (verb, noun and 
so on) which determines much of the structure of the rest of 
the clause.
predicate centre The obligatory component of a predicate. 
The predicate centre determines the clause type; it is a verb 
in verbal clauses and one of a number of phrase types in non-
verbal clauses, such as a noun phrase in a noun clause.

xxxii Glossary of grammatical terms
predicate phrase A phrase built around an obligatory predicate 
centre, including negative, temporal markers and modals 
such as tidak boleh nadir ‘not allowed to be present’.
preﬁ x An afﬁ x which occurs before a base, such as ber- in the 
word berjalan ‘walk’.
preposition A word which links a following noun phrase to the 
rest of a clause, telling what the relationship of that noun 
phrase is to the clause. For instance, the preposition di ‘in’ 
tells that the following noun kota is the location, in Mereka 
tinggal di kota ‘They live in the city’.
prepositional clause A clause whose predicate is a preposi-
tional phrase, such as di Jakarta ‘in Jakarta’, in Dia di Jakarta 
sekarang ‘She’s in Jakarta now’.
prepositional phrase A construction consisting of a preposi-
tion followed by a noun phrase, such as untuk orang itu ‘for 
those people’ and dengan teman saya ‘with my friend’.
prepositional relative clause A relative clause which begins 
with a preposition. The noun following the preposi-
tion is identical to the head of the embedding phrase and 
so is replaced by -nya. The following example derives 
from the prepositional phrase di belakang rumah 
‘behind the house’: rumah yang di belakangnya ada 
pohon mangga ‘the house behind which there is a mango 
tree’.
primary object The object which immediately follows the verb 
and which becomes the subject when the clause is trans-
formed into a passive. See also secondary object.
primary verb A verb which has primary afﬁ xation, that is, afﬁ x-
ation which is not described as replacing some other afﬁ xation 
to achieve a certain effect. Primary afﬁ xation refers to no afﬁ x, 
ber- or meN- on intransitive verbs, and meN- or di-, alone 
or in combination with -kan, -i or per- on transitive verbs. 
See also secondary verb.
productive A process (especially use of an afﬁ x) which is not 
restricted to a limited set of words but can be applied to new 
words.
pronoun A word which stands for a noun when it is clear who or 
what is being spoken about, such as kita ‘we’, semuanya ‘all 
of them’.

Glossary of grammatical terms xxxiii
pronoun substitute A noun which is used for ﬁ rst or second 
person and thus acts like a pronoun. Pronoun substi-
tutes are personal names or kinship terms, such as bapak 
‘father’, translated ‘you’ if used to refer to the person being 
addressed and translated ‘I’ if referring to the person 
speaking.
proper noun The speciﬁ c name of a person, thing or place, such 
as Ali, Hotel Indonesia, Jakarta.
pseudo-intransitive verb A transitive verb which can occur 
without its object being expressed, thus resembling an 
intransitive verb, such as membaca ‘read’, in Saya sedang 
membaca ‘I’m reading’.
quantiﬁ er A word or phrase which occurs before a noun to 
indicate quantity. It can be a number occurring alone, such 
as dua ‘two’, or in combination with a classiﬁ er or partitive, 
such as setengah gelas (air) ‘half a glass of (water)’.
quantity clause A clause in which the predicate states the 
number or measurement of the subject, such as Anaknya 
lima ‘She has ﬁ ve children’ (literally: ‘Her children are ﬁ ve’).
question See information question and yes–no question.
question word A word occurring in an information question 
which corresponds to one of the ‘wh-’ words in English, such 
as siapa ‘who’, kapan ‘when’. Also called an interrogative.
quote noun The base word of a quote noun phrase. 
quote noun phrase A phrase indicating direct quotation and 
formed by a quote noun plus -nya, for example katanya 
‘he said’ in ‘Selamat pagi’, katanya ‘“Good morning”, he 
said’.
recipient The person at whom an action is directed. It usually 
follows prepositions kepada and pada ‘to’. With some verbs, 
especially -i verbs, it can occur as object, such as dia ‘he’ in 
dia dikirimi uang ‘he is sent money’.
reciprocal verb A verb which indicates that two people do the 
same thing to each other or that two people or things stand 
in the same relation to each other. Corresponding verbs in 
English usually have ‘each other’ as object, as in Mereka 
pukul-memukul ‘They hit each other’.

xxxiv Glossary of grammatical terms
reduplication The doubling of a word (see full reduplication) 
or the addition of a syllable before the word (see partial 
reduplication).
referent phrase The component of an adjective phrase which 
indicates with reference to whom or what the characteristic 
indicated by the adjective applies. It is introduced by a prep-
osition such as untuk ‘for’, as in terlalu besar untuk saya 
‘too big for me’.
reﬂ exive The word sendiri ‘self’ which occurs with nouns and 
pronouns to emphasise or make clear who or what is being 
referred to. See also reﬂ exive phrase.
reﬂ exive phrase A phrase which usually occurs as the object of 
a verb to indicate that the object refers to the same person 
as the subject. The full phrase is diri + pronoun + sendiri, 
as in Dia mencandai dirinya sendiri ‘He jokes at himself. 
See also reﬂ exive pronoun.
reﬂ exive pronoun The word diri ‘self’, which can occur alone, as 
in menjaga diri ‘look after oneself’, or in a reﬂ exive phrase.
relative clause A clause preceded by yang and occurring in a 
noun phrase to give information about the noun. The term 
usually refers to a deﬁ ning relative clause, as in orang yang 
duduk di situ ‘the person who is sitting there’. See also 
locative relative clause and nominalised relative clause.
second person See person.
secondary object A noun which indicates the patient and which 
follows the primary object of a ditransitive verb, such as 
uang ‘money’ in Dia memberi mereka uang ‘He gave them 
money’.
secondary verb A verb which has secondary afﬁ xation, which 
replaces primary afﬁ xation under certain circumstances. 
Thus terbakar ‘burned’ is a secondary verb, whose afﬁ x ter- 
replaces primary afﬁ x di- to indicate accidental action. See 
also primary verb.
semantic role See participant.
sentence A construction which can stand alone as a complete 
utterance. A sentence can be a statement, question, command 
or exclamation.
sentence adjunct An adjunct which is not part of a clause 

Glossary of grammatical terms xxxv
but is used with a clause or series of clauses to convey the 
speaker’s comment on what is being said, such as rupanya 
‘apparently’, sayang ‘unfortunately’. Also called sentence 
adverbial or disjunct.
sentence adverbial See sentence adjunct.
sentence linker A word similar to a conjunction but which 
instead of linking one clause to another within a sentence 
links two sentences, at the same time indicating the kind of 
connection there is between the two sentences, such as oleh 
karena itu ‘therefore’, meskipun demikian ‘despite that, 
nevertheless’.
sentence tag A word attached to the end of a question for such 
purposes as seeking conﬁ rmation, such as bukan in Saudara 
mahasiswa, bukan? ‘You are a student, aren’t you?’
simple intransitive verb An intransitive verb which has no 
afﬁ xation, such as tidur ‘sleep’, duduk ‘sit’.
simple nominal clause An active verbal clause used as a noun, 
meaning ‘the general activity denoted by the verb’. It can have 
an object but no subject and usually occurs as the subject of 
a clause, such as mencari pekerjaan ‘looking for work’ in 
Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah ‘Finding 
work in the city is not very easy’.
simple sentence A sentence which consists of a single indepen-
dent clause.
simple transitive verb A transitive verb which consists only of a 
base and one of the inﬂ ectional afﬁ xes meN- or di-, such as 
menulis ‘write’, ditulis ‘written’.
simple word A word which consists solely of a base, which 
cannot be broken down into smaller units, such as orang 
‘person’, duduk ‘sit’.
statement An utterance used when we give information, express 
an opinion and so on. Statements are sometimes said to be in 
the declarative mood.
stative verb A verb with preﬁ x ter- which refers to a state rather 
than an action and which thus has no actor, such as terletak 
‘located’.
subject The component of a clause which is the thing being 
discussed, the ‘theme’ of the utterance. It is frequently some-
thing which has been mentioned previously, about which 

xxxvi Glossary of grammatical terms
something new (the predicate) is said, as Ali in Ali sudah 
pulang ‘Ali has gone home’.
subordinate clause A clause which cannot stand alone as a 
sentence but which occurs with another clause (the main 
clause) in a complex sentence. It can occur either before or 
after the main clause to add information to it. The subordi-
nate clause is preceded by a subordinating conjunction, such 
as sesudah ‘after’, in Mereka berangkat sesudah makan ‘They 
left after eating’.
subordinate verb See complement verb.
subordinating conjunction A conjunction which occurs before 
a subordinate clause, such as ketika ‘when’, karena ‘because’.
subordination Making one clause subordinate to another. See 
subordinate clause.

‘writing’.
superlative adjective phrase A phrase in which an adjective is 
preceded by paling or ter- ‘most’, as in paling besar ‘biggest’, 
tertinggi ‘highest’.
superordinate verb See main verb.
tag See sentence tag.
temporal marker A word within the predicate which indicates 
that the action has occurred, is occurring, or is yet to occur 
in relation to the moment of utterance or in relation to some 
other event referred to, such as masih ‘still’, akan ‘will’, belum 
‘not yet’.
third person See person.
topic The component of a topic-comment clause which occurs 
ﬁ rst for foregrounding. It is identiﬁ ed with a component 
of the basic clause from which the topic-comment clause 
derives and its place in that clause is marked by -nya. Thus, 
sopir itu ‘that driver’ is the topic in Sopir itu namanya Ali 
‘(As for) that driver, his name is Ali’.
topic-comment clause A clause which contains a topic followed 
by the comment, which consists of the rest of the clause, 
including subject and predicate. See also topic.
topic-comment relative clause A relative clause derived from 
a topic-comment clause. See also object topic-comment 

Glossary of grammatical terms xxxvii
relative clause and possessor topic-comment relative 
clause.
transitive clause A verbal clause which has an object and which 
contains a transitive verb. See also transitive verb.

refers to an action which has two participants, an actor and a 
patient, such as membawa ‘carry’, melempar ‘throw’.
verb A word which refers to an action, such as lari ‘run’, 
membaca ‘read’, or a state, such as tidur ‘sleep’, terletak 
‘located’. It occurs as the predicate of a verbal clause. See also 
intransitive verb and transitive verb.

will identify the actor (active voice) or the patient (passive 
voice). See also active voice and passive voice.
yes–no question A question which can be answered by ‘yes’ 
or ‘no’. It does not contain a question word. See also infor-
mation question.

INTRODUCTION
This is a description of the Indonesian language for English-
speaking teachers and learners and for any others interested in 
the language and its structures.
The work recognises that the majority of such people will not 
be familiar with linguistic concepts and terminology. Conse-
quently it avoids linguistic jargon and theoretical discussion. 
It also differs from linguistic studies in that it does not always 
describe Indonesian grammar ‘in its own right’. The special 
needs of English learners of the language are taken into account, 
with more detailed discussion of structures which differ signiﬁ -
cantly from corresponding structures in English. English and 
Indonesian structures are speciﬁ cally contrasted if the Indo-
nesian structure is one which causes particular difﬁ culty for 
English-speaking learners.
The variety of Indonesian described here can be called 
formal standard Indonesian. This can loosely be identiﬁ ed as the 
language of government, administration and the mass media in 
the Republic of Indonesia. It is the type of Indonesian in which 
education takes place and which is used by educated people 
in formal situations, whether written or spoken. There is only 
oc casional  mention here of forms characteristic mainly of collo-
quial and non-standard varieties of Indonesian. Such varieties 

2 Introduction
of the language vary considerably from region to region, social 
group to social group and according to the degree of informality of 
the situation. Attempting to deal with what are essentially differ-
ent grammatical systems together in a single description would 
result in a confusing hotchpotch and would divert attention 
from the basic aim of this work, which is to provide a descrip-
tion of the formal standard language. In some cases colloquial 
forms are mentioned if they are widely used. However, this is 
rarely done and phenomena such as the dropping of certain 
verbal afﬁ xes in everyday speech are not discussed. For more 
information on colloquial Indonesian, especially the Jakarta 
variety, see Sneddon (2006) and Ewing (2005).
Even within formal standard Indonesian there is a con-
siderable amount of variation compared with that found in 
standard English. Where there are alternative structures only 
one might be acceptable to some educated people. Mention of 
such differences is sometimes made. If published sources give 
conﬂ icting opinions as to the grammaticality of a structure, 
this is sometimes mentioned in an endnote. Much variation, 
however, must go uncommented upon, including the tendency 
of certain structures to be favoured by people of particular 
regional language backgrounds.
Only rarely is comment made on the frequency of occur-
rence of forms or on their level of formality (although forms 
occurring mainly in colloquial styles are speciﬁ cally identiﬁ ed 
as such). Differences in usage between people of different social 
and ethnic groups make this a complex topic in the study of 
the Indonesian language and comments are necessarily very 
general.
Further, Indonesian is a language in a state of rapid change. 
New words suddenly appear, some to acquire permanent 
acceptance, others to quickly disappear. The mass media, 
frequently translating from English, are constantly introducing 
English words and structures. With the enormous inﬂ uence of 
the press on the language, structures regarded as un-Indo nesian 
or ungrammatical quite recently have become acceptable (at 
least to some people) today. The Javanese language too con-
tinues to inﬂ uence Indonesian, both in lexicon and syntax. 
The changes that have been occurring in Indonesian present 

Introduction 3
difﬁ culties for any attempt to describe the language. A grammar 
is basically a synchronic statement and little attempt is made 
here to capture diachronic change, although some important 
current trends are noted. Structures which were common in 
earlier language may not be mentioned here if they were not 
recorded in modern usage.
In order to provide a practical reference for most user needs 
a grammar must aim for a certain degree of completeness. The 
present grammar describes in some detail all the major struc-
tures of Indonesian from words to complex sentences. However, 
it stops far short of attempting to describe the various func-
tions of individual words, this being the task of dictionaries 
and studies of word usage (such as Sarumpaet 1980). While 
contrasts between function words are frequently pointed out, 
this is necessarily brief; Kaswanti Purwo’s attempt to investi-
gate the differences in function between various deictic words 
(Kaswanti Purwo 1984) reveals what an enormous task this 
would be if extended to the entire lexicon.
In the production of this work the original author, Jim 
Sneddon, drew on many sources for information on the 
language, exploiting the study and insights of numerous 
people. All published works from which information on Indo-
nesian grammar have been taken are given in the list of refer-
ences. While major structures are dealt with in some detail, as 
mentioned above, the description is hampered by the fact that 
many areas of Indonesian grammar have not been subjected 
to detailed analysis. Gaps in our knowledge are found in all 
areas of the grammar, with a great deal of analysis still being 
required on the afﬁ xes ter and ke-...-an, on reciprocal construc-
tions and on complementation, to name but a very few areas. This 
grammar then is only as complete as research on any area allows.
An attempt is made to provide a reasonable number of 
varied examples in natural contexts for all structures discussed. 
Examples of constructions are drawn from numerous sources, 
including newspapers, magazines and novels, television, radio, 
the internet and, to a lesser extent, from conversation. Others are 
directly elicited from speakers of Indonesian. Where a number 
of words function in the same way a list of examples is usually 
provided. English glosses to words in such lists are meant as a 

4 Introduction
guide only. A gloss does not attempt to capture the complexities 
of a word’s meaning and refers only to its meaning in the partic-
ular construction being discussed. Where dictionaries disagree 
as to the meaning of a word, a not uncommon occurrence, the 
tendency here is to follow Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991). 
Echols and Shadily’s dictionary (in the 1989 revision edited by 
John Wolff and James Collins) and that of Stevens and Schmid-
gall-Tellings (2004) have also been inﬂ uential.
The work is in four chapters, each based on one of the four 
basic levels of Indonesian grammar discussed: Words, Phrases, 
Clauses, Sentences. No chapter is strictly conﬁ ned to describ-
ing elements at the level referred to in its title. In particular, 
in dealing with the function of certain afﬁ xes, a satisfactory 
description must take into account the syntactic structures 
within which words taking those afﬁ xes occur. This is especially 
true in the coverage of verbal afﬁ xes.
Because many structures must be referred to in several 
sections, cross-referencing is extensive. This attempts to help 
the reader ﬁ nd desired information as quickly as possible, 
something often very difﬁ cult in reference grammars. This is 
also aided by a table of contents at the beginning of the work 
and a more detailed index at the end. Sections are numbered 
consecutively from the beginning to the end of each chapter. As 
far as possible, each section has been designed to be informative 
if read alone, thus providing the reader with useful information 
on a particular small aspect of the language.
A grammar is essentially a set of generalisations about a 
language, each structure described being a general description of 
a large number of utterances of a particular form. In order for 
structures to be conveniently discussed labels must be applied to 
them. These labels are called grammatical terms. Grammatical 
terms used in this work are deﬁ ned in the section dealing with the 
structure they label. A glossary of common terms is also provided. 
Terms used are basically the common terms of traditional 
grammar, although some are used here in a somewhat differ-
ent way from what is usual in grammars of English. Moreover, 
a few terms have been coined here speciﬁ cally to meet the needs 
of Indonesian grammar. However, an effort is made to keep the 
number of grammar terms to a minimum.

Introduction 5
Spelling used in this work is the ofﬁ cial Ejaan yang disem-
purnakan, introduced in 1972 (see, for instance, Kridalaksana 
1978). Punctuation is usually retained as it occurred in written 
examples, although this results in some inconsistency, mainly in 
the use of commas. 
A very short and general description of the spelling rules 
and pronunciation of Indonesian is given at the beginning of 
Chapter 1. More detailed discussion of phonology requires 
a level of technical description not informative to people 
without a linguistics training, and for this reason is excluded. 
Works providing such description include Alieva et al. (1991), 
Macdonald (1976) and Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia 
(1988, 1993).
Levels of grammar above the sentence are not dealt with. 
Indonesian discourse structure still awaits adequate analysis 
and, further, it is felt that a description of higher levels would 
not be perceived by many users as having the practical value of 
lower-level analysis. Nevertheless, a study of Indonesian para-
graph and discourse structure along the lines of the present 
work would be a worthy project for a future date.
Much about the Indonesian language apart from its grammar 
could not be included in the present study. An extensive discus-
sion of the history of the language and its position within present 
day Indonesian society can be found in Sneddon (2003).
In the production of this work a number of grammars of 
English were consulted, including Quirk and Greenbaum 
(1973) and Leech and Svartvik (1975). Collins Cobuild English 
Grammar (1990) was especially valuable and has had an impor-
tant inﬂ uence on the nature of this work.

1 WORDS
Words can be simple or complex. A simple word consists solely 
of a base, which cannot be broken down into smaller units. 
A base carries the essential meaning of a word and is the part 
of the word listed alphabetically in a dictionary. Examples of 
simple words are buku ‘book’, lebar ‘wide’, duduk ‘sit’.
This chapter describes how complex words are formed. It 
begins with a short outline of Indonesian spelling and pronun-
ciation in section 1.2. A word can be complex in a number of 
ways. It can consist of reduplicated bases, such as buku-buku 
‘books’. Reduplication is discussed in sections 1.10–29. It can be 
a compound of two bases, such as asal-usul ‘origin’. Compounds 
are discussed in sections 1.30–5. A word can also consist of a 
base with one or more afﬁ xes, such as membukukan ‘enter in 
a book’, diperlebar ‘widened’, kedudukan ‘situation’.
The description of afﬁ xes and their functions forms the 
major part of this chapter, beginning at section 1.38.
There are three types of afﬁ x in Indonesian: preﬁ xes, sufﬁ xes 
and circumﬁ xes. A preﬁ x is attached before the base. When a 
preﬁ x is discussed separately it is indicated by a hyphen after it, 
such as ber-. A sufﬁ x comes after a base, indicated by a hyphen 
before it: -an. A circumﬁ x contains two parts, one occurring 
before the base and one after. When a circumﬁ x is mentioned 
1.1

8 Words
separately the two parts are separated by three dots, this indi-
cating the position of the base: ke-…-an. When only the ﬁ rst 
part of a circumﬁ x is referred to, the term ‘preﬁ x’ is used. A 
fourth type of afﬁ x, the inﬁ x, is not part of the system of modern 
Indonesian, although its earlier occurrence is seen from a few 
fossilised forms, discussed in sections 1.36–7. An inﬁ x is placed 
after the ﬁ rst consonant sound of a base; when referred to sepa-
rately, an inﬁ x has hyphens placed before and after it: -el-.
NOTES ON SPELLING AND PRONUNCIATION
The spelling and pronunciation of Indonesian are generally 
very easy and straightforward. Most sounds belonging to Indo-
nesian also occur in English, although they may be written in 
a different way. Furthermore, every letter or combination of 
letters stands for one sound, except for e, which is ambiguous 
(see below).
Consonants
Indonesian has the following consonants: p, t, k, c, ’, b, d, g, j, 
z, m, n, ng, ny, r, l, f, v, s, sy, h, kh, w and y, which are treated 
individually below.
p, t, k like English ‘p’, ‘t’, ‘k’, but without aspiration (compare 
English p, t, k, as pronounced by many non-native speakers).
At the end of a word, these consonants remain ‘unreleased’; 
that is, the consonant is formed and then held momentarily 
without releasing the airﬂ ow.
c like English ‘ch’, as in ‘choke’, ‘check’, ‘itchy’, but less emphatic; 
in fact, with many speakers it tends to become pronounced 
more like ‘ts’, as in ‘Betsy’, ‘ﬂ otsam’. Examples are cantik ‘beauti-
ful, pretty’, cacing ‘worm’.
’ indicates a glottal stop, which is the sound heard in the 
English expression ‘uh-oh!’ It is also heard in the Cockney English 
pronunciation of words like ‘matter’ [ma’er]1 , ‘sick’[si’]. This ’ 
is mainly found in words of Arabic provenance such as ma’af 
‘sorry’, do’a (also written and pronounced as doa) ‘prayer’ and, 
occasionally, in ya’itu ‘that is, i.e.’ (although this word is usually 
spelled yaitu, and the glottal stop is not always pronounced).
Note that a glottal stop is also heard—but not written—
1.2

 Notes on spelling and pronunciation 9
when two like vowels become adjacent, as in kebudayaan 
‘culture’, which is pronounced [kebudaya’an], or when a schwa 
(e, see below) becomes adjacent to another vowel, as in keingi-
nan ‘desire’, which is pronounced [ke’inginan].
b, d, g like the English voiced stops ‘b’, ‘d’,2  (hard)3  ‘g’.
b, d, g can also appear at the end of a word (this only 
happens in loanwords). When they do, they are pronounced 
as unreleased p, t, k, respectively, as in tertib ‘order’, which is 
pronounced [tertip], or in wujud ‘the form something takes’, 
which is pronounced [wujut]. However, if these voiced stops 
immediately occur before the sufﬁ xes -an or -i, they are still 
pronounced as b, d and g, as can be seen in ketertiban ‘orderli-
ness’, which is pronounced [ketertiban], and perwujudan ‘shape, 
form; materialisation’, which is pronounced [perwujudan].
j somewhere between English ‘j’ or ‘dg’ in ‘John’, ‘fridge’, ‘badge’, 
and ‘dz’ in ‘adze’. Examples are jalan ‘road’, janji ‘promise’.
z like English ‘z’. However, this sound only occurs in foreign 
words, and some speakers have a tendency to pronounce it as j, 
as in zaman ‘era, period’, which is pronounced [zaman] as well 
as [jaman] and is also often spelled jaman.
m, n like English ‘m’, ‘n’.
ng like English ‘ng’ in ‘thing’, ‘bangers’, ‘hanging’. However, 
unlike in English, Indonesian ng also occurs at the beginning of 
a word, as in ngeri ‘horrifying, ghastly’, nganga ‘agape’.
ny as the ‘ny’ sound in English ‘onion’, ‘tenure’, or in the 
Italian city name ‘Bologna’. But again, unlike in English, ny also 
occurs at the beginning of words, as in nyanyian ‘song’, nyata 
‘obvious, real’.
r like an Italian or Spanish ‘r’: it is pronounced with the tip of 
the tongue against the alveolar ridge (the hard part immediately 
behind the upper teeth). Examples are rumah ‘house’, dilarang 
‘forbidden’, layar ‘sail’.
Note: for those who have a hard time pronouncing this sound, 
try to say ‘prawn’, ‘crown’ or ‘track’ while substituting d for r in 
these words (hence, ‘pdawn’, ‘cdown’, ‘tdack’) and then speed up 
their pronunciation: the d will soon come out like a ‘tongue-tip r’.
l like English ‘l’, but less heavy (as in ‘like’ or ‘alone’, not as in 
‘almost’); examples are lalat ‘ﬂ y’, gatal ‘to itch’.
f, v both are pronounced like English ‘f’, and sometimes 

10 Words
as ‘p’. These are recent acquisitions in Indonesian which only 
occur in loanwords, which explains why there is a tendency to 
pronounce them as a ‘p’. However, they are usually not confused 
in writing; for example, ﬁ lsafat ‘philosophy’, fonologi ‘phonol-
ogy’, fasih [fasih, pasih] ‘ﬂ uent’, famili [famili, pamili] ‘relative; 
family’, kaﬁ r ‘unbeliever’, alif (ﬁ rst letter of Arabic alphabet), 
vonis [fonis, ponis] ‘verdict’, divisi [diﬁ si] ‘(military) division’.
s like English ‘s’.
sy often pronounced as spelled [sy], but some speakers will 
also pronounce it like English ‘sh’ in ‘shopping’, ‘ﬁ sherman’, 
‘rush’. It occurs mainly in foreign words; for example, syarat 
‘condition’, asyik ‘passionate, absorbed’, syampo ‘shampoo’. 
These words are also sometimes pronounced with [s] instead; 
for example, [sarat], [asik], [sampu] or [sampo].
h This sound is similar to English ‘h’, although it has a lighter 
pronunciation—or is not pronounced at all—at the beginning 
of a word, as in hidung [hidung, idung] ‘nose’, or in the middle 
of a word between unlike vowels, as in menyahut ‘to answer’ 
[m
e
nyahut, m
e
nyaut]. At the end of a word, its pronunciation 
varies from one speaker to the other. Some speakers pronounce 
it with a heavy h, which tends towards the sound ‘ch’ in Loch 
Ness, others pronounce it more slightly (as an ordinary h), and 
some do not pronounce it at all (hence rumah [rumach, rumah, 
ruma] ‘house’).
kh like the ‘ch’ in Loch Ness. kh is sometimes also pronounced 
as an ordinary k; it occurs mainly in Arabic and Dutch loan-
words such as khabar (also kabar) ‘news’, khusus (also kusus) 
‘special’, ikhlas ‘sincere’, khlor ‘chlorine’.
w, y like English ‘w’, ‘y’.
Vowels
Indonesian has the following vowels: a, e, é, i, o, u. They are 
pronounced as follows:
a sounds more or less like ‘a’ in Omaha or in British ‘bar’, but 
with the mouth slightly more open.
e a schwa, sounds like the vowel in ‘uh’ or in the last syllable 
of ‘panel’.
é like ‘e’ in ‘equity’ or ‘pet’. Note that Indonesian spelling does 
not distinguish between this sound and schwa e, which are both 

 Notes on spelling and pronunciation 11
written as e. This is a problem for learners of Indonesian, who 
will have to learn which pronunciation applies in each instance 
where a word is written with ‘e’. In some cases the occurrence 
of schwa e and é is predictable, and most learners will develop 
an intuition for which sound applies in individual cases. (For 
instance, e in the ﬁ rst syllable of words of three syllables is 
almost always a schwa, as in meréka ‘they’). However, there is no 
total predictability. The learner will have to ﬁ nd out whether the 
pronunciation is schwa or é on a case-by-case basis by checking 
a dictionary or asking a speaker. For reference, following is a list 
of frequently occurring words that have é as indicated: berbéda, 
énak, és, Indonésia, keréta, méja, melémpar, mengékspor, 
menyéwa, meréka, oléh, pél, péna, suksés, trén.
i like ‘i’ in ‘litre’, ‘ee’ in ‘teens’, or ‘ea’ in ‘leaf’.
o like the ‘o’ in English ‘open’, or the ‘au’ in ‘taught’.
u like ‘oo’ in ‘book’, or the ‘ou’ in ‘soup’.
Diphthongs
Indonesian has three ‘diphthongs’ (combinations of vowels 
within one syllable), ai, au and oi, which occur at the end of 
certain bases.
ai is ofﬁ cially pronounced like the diphthong in English 
‘rye’ or ‘pie’. However, many Indonesians have a tendency 
to pronounce it as é. For instance, pantai ‘beach’ is ofﬁ cially 
pronounced [pantay] but has a more informal variant [panté].
au is ofﬁ cially pronounced like the English diphthong in 
‘cow’ or ‘allow’, but many Indonesians tend to pronounce it as o. 
For instance, danau ‘lake’ has a formal pronunciation [danaw] 
but has a more informal variant [dano].
oi is pronounced like the vowels in ‘ploy’ or ‘coy’; for example, 
sepoi-sepoi ‘gentle (of wind)’.
Stress
Stress does not play a prominent role in Indonesian. While it is 
there, it is not as clear as in English or other European languages. 
In most cases it falls on the second to last syllable of a word, as 
indicated by the underlining in dalang ‘puppeteer’, hulu ‘head 
of river; inland’, or pesisir ‘coast’. However, this does not happen 
if a word has a schwa in this syllable, or has only one syllable to 

12 Words
begin with; in such cases, stress falls on the last (or only) syllable; 
for example, empat ‘four’, belum ‘not yet’, dan ‘and’.
If a word obtains one of the sufﬁ xes -i, -an or -kan, stress 
moves to the next syllable; for example, hidup ‘live; be alive’, 
kehidupan ‘life’.
SOUND CHANGES IN COMPLEX WORDS
A number of sound changes occur when afﬁ xes and bases 
combine. The major changes are discussed in sections 1.4–8. 
Other sound changes affecting afﬁ xes are minor and are dealt 
with in discussion of the individual afﬁ xes.
The following symbols are used in the discussion of such 
sound changes. A plus sign (+) indicates a sequence of afﬁ x and 
base. An arrow (−>) indicates the form which results from their 
combination. Thus ber- + renang −> berenang means that 
when preﬁ x ber- and base renang are combined the result is the 
complex word berenang.
Preﬁ xes ber-, per-, ter-
Preﬁ xes ber-, per-, ter- and circumﬁ xes which have ber- 
or per- as their preﬁ x component undergo the changes listed 
below:
The r of the preﬁ x is lost under the following circum-
stances:
When the base begins with r:
ber- 
+ 
renang 
−>
berenang
per-
+
rusak
−>
perusak
ter
+
rasa
−>
terasa
When the base begins with the sound combination CerC, where 
C represents any consonant:
ber-
+
serta
−>
beserta
ber-
+
terbang 
+
-an
−>
beterbangan
per-
+
kerja 
+
-an
−>
pekerjaan
ter-
+
pergok
−>
tepergok
1.3
1.4

 Sound changes in complex words 13
Loss of r before a base beginning with CerC is not entirely 
regular; in a few words it does not occur or is optional. Thus:
ter-
+
percaya
−>
tepercaya, terpercaya
Preﬁ x ter- usually becomes te- with the bases lanjur and lantar. 
The ter- forms are regarded by some as substandard and are not 
listed in all dictionaries. In some dictionaries, te- is regarded as 
part of the base rather than as a preﬁ x:
ter-
+
lanjur
−>
telanjur, terlanjur
ter-
+
lantar
−>
telantar, terlantar
With base ajar the r in ber- and per- is replaced by l:
ber-
+
ajar
−>
belajar
per-
+
ajar
+
-an
−>
pelajaran
Preﬁ xes meN- and peN-
The capital N represents a sound which changes depending on 
the ﬁ rst sound of the base. N can appear as one of the nasals 
m, n, ny, ng, or as zero. Sometimes the nasal comes before the 
ﬁ rst sound of the base and sometimes it replaces the ﬁ rst sound. 
(Initial p, t, s and k are ﬁ rst sounds that, as a rule, are replaced.) 
The rules are illustrated by meN- but apply equally to peN- and 
peN-…-an. Exceptions to the rules are given in section 1.6 
and the afﬁ xation with single-syllable bases in section 1.7.
N becomes ng before a vowel
If the word begins with a vowel, preﬁ x meng- is attached:
meN-
+
ajar
−>

meN-
+
ekspor
−>
mengekspor
meN-
+
erang
−>
mengerang
meN-
+
olah
−>
mengolah
meN-
+
urus
−>

N becomes m with initial b, p, f
If the word begins with b, p or f, preﬁ x mem- occurs. Initial p 
is lost:
meN-
+
beli
−>
membeli
meN-
+
pakai
−>

N becomes ny with initial s
If the word begins with s, preﬁ x meny- occurs. Initial s is lost:
meny-
+
sewa
−>
menyewa
N becomes ng with initial g, k, h, kh
If the word begins with g, k, h or kh, preﬁ x meng- occurs. Initial 
k is lost:
meN-

ganggu
−>
mengganggu
meN-
+
kirim
−>
mengirim
meN-
+
hilang
−>

meN-
+
khawatir + -kan
−>
mengkhawatirkan
N is lost before other initial sounds
If the word begins with l, r, m, n, ny, ng, w or y, preﬁ x me- 
occurs:
meN-
+
lihat
−>
melihat
meN-
+
rasa
−>

meN-
+
wakil 
+
-i
−>

meN-
+
yakin 
+
-i
−>
meyakini
Sometimes the same sequence of sounds can result from differ-
ent combinations of N and initial base sound, so the initial 
sound of the base cannot be predicted from the form of the 

 Sound changes in complex words 15
derived verb. Thus, ny results both from meny + s (which is 
lost) and from me + ny:
menyewa
from
meny-
+
sewa
menyanyi
from
me-
+
nyanyi
The sequence of ng and a vowel can result from three com-
binations:
mengarang
from
meng-
+
karang
mengarang
from
meng-
+
arang
menganga
from
me-
+
nganga
N undergoes the same changes with afﬁ xes peN- and peN-…-an 
as it does with meN-. For example:
peN-
+
tulis
−>
penulis
peN-
+
tulis
+
-an
−>
penulisan
Exceptions to the rules for N
If preﬁ x meN- is followed by preﬁ x per-, the initial p of per- is 
not lost:
meN-
+
per-
+ 
lebar
−>
memperlebar
meN
+
per-
+
oleh
−>
memperoleh
If the base begins with the sequence perC (that is, per followed 
by a consonant), the initial p is lost irregularly:
meN-
+
percaya
+
-i
−>
mempercayai
meN-
+
pergok
+
-i
−>
mempergoki, 
memergoki
meN-
+
percik
+
-i
−>
memerciki
The p of preﬁ x per- and of base-initial perC is lost following 
preﬁ x peN-:
peN-
+
per-
+ satu
−>
pemersatu
peN-
+
per-
+ oleh + -an
−>
pemerolehan
peN-
+
perkosa
−>
pemerkosa
With some bases initial p, t, s and k are not lost. If s is not lost, 
N becomes n. With the exception of verbs beginning with perC, 
this is almost entirely conﬁ ned to words borrowed from other 
1.6

16 Words
languages. The initial sound is most likely to be retained if the 
word is still felt to be foreign. Thus retention of the sound is 
common in words beginning with consonant clusters, which do 
not occur in indigenous words: 
meN-
+ proklamasi
+ -kan −> memproklamasikan
meN-
+ traktir
−> mentraktir
meN-
+ swadaya 
+ -kan −> menswadayakan
meN-
+ klasiﬁ kasi 
+ -kan −> mengklasiﬁ kasikan
Initial p, t, s and k are sometimes retained in borrowings, even 
where there is no initial consonant cluster. As a borrowing 
becomes more accepted as an Indonesian word, the tendency 
increases for people to use the more regular form without the 
initial consonant of the base. During a transition period, both 
forms occur:
meN-
+
protes
−> memprotes, 
memrotes
meN-
+
taat 
+
-i
−> mentaati, menaati
meN-
+
sukses +
-kan
−> mensukseskan, 
menyukseskan
meN-
+
kritik
−> mengkritik, 
mengritik
The time at which the ‘changeover’ occurs and the length of 
the transition period differs from word to word (and to some 
extent from speaker to speaker). Thus, mentaati and menaati 
‘obey’ continue to exist side by side, while after many years of 
use menterjemahkan ‘translate’ was completely replaced by 
menerjemahkan in a very short period during the mid-1980s.
In a few non-borrowed words, base-initial p remains. The 
word mempengaruhi ‘inﬂ uence’, from base pengaruh, may 
result from interpretation of the word as having preﬁ x peN-. 
However, mempunyai ‘possess’, from base punya, must be 
regarded as an exception in the modern language.
With kaji both possibilities occur, but with different 
meanings: mengaji ‘recite the Quran’, pengajian ‘Quran reading’, 
and mengkaji ‘to research, carry out study’, pengkajian ‘study, 
research’.

 Sound changes in complex words 17
Preﬁ x peng- occurs with the bases lihat, rajin and lepas: 
penglihatan ‘sight’, pengrajin ‘craftsman’, penglepasan ‘release’ 
(as well as pelepasan). During the early 1990s there was an 
increasing tendency for pengrajin to be regularised as perajin.
The base tahu ‘know’ takes the preﬁ xes menge- and penge-: 
mengetahui ‘get to know’, pengetahuan ‘knowledge’.
N becomes ny and initial sy is lost from the base syair: 
menyair ‘write poetry’, penyair ‘poet’.
MeN- and peN- with single-syllable bases
With single-syllable bases, which are all borrowings from other 
languages, meN- and peN- optionally become menge- and 
penge-. The regular form of the preﬁ x can occur instead, in which 
case initial p, t, s, k are not lost. Some people recognise only the 
menge- variant as being standard.4 The frequency of either form 
depends both on the individual base and personal preference:
meN-
+
pel
−>
mengepel, mempel
meN-
+
cek
−>
mengecek, mencek
meN-
+
bom
−>
mengebom, membom
meN-
+
tik
−>
mengetik, mentik
meN-
+
sah 
+
-kan
−>
mengesahkan, 
mensahkan
meN-
+
rem
−>
mengerem, merem
Derivatives with peN- and peN-…-an act similarly:
peN-
+
bom +
-an
−>
pengeboman, 
pemboman
peN-
+
sah
+
-an
−>
pengesahan, 
pensahan
With passive preﬁ x di- (see 3.27) the base occurs in the normal 
way: dibom, dipel and so on. With the borrowed word tik ‘type’ 
ke- optionally occurs in the passive: ditik, diketik. Because of 
this, both ketik and tik are recognised as bases. Some people 
regard menge- as containing a preﬁ x ke-, which functions to 
form a two-syllable base, such forms being the most common 
base in indigenous words. The retention of nge in reduplicated 
bases (see 1.8) strengthens this view.
1.7

18 Words
Reduplicated bases with meN- and peN-
When a base preﬁ xed with meN- is reduplicated, N is retained 
on the reduplicated base where the initial consonant has been 
lost. The symbol R represents full base reduplication (see 
1.10):
meN-
+
bagi-R
−>
membagi-bagi
meN-
+
amat-R 
+
-i −>
mengamat-amati
meN-
+
minta-R
−>
meminta-minta
meN-
+
pijit-R
−>
memijit-mijit
meN-
+
tulis-R
−>
menulis-nulis
meN-
+
kayuh-R
−>
mengayuh-ngayuh
When meN- is realised as menge- before a single-syllable base 
(see 1.7), the sequence nge occurs on the reduplicated base:
meN-
+
cek-R
−> mengecek-ngecek
WORD-FORMING PROCESSES
The word-forming processes in Indonesian are discussed in 
the remainder of this chapter. The individual afﬁ xes, their 
functions and the combinations in which they occur are 
discussed from section 1.44 to the end of the chapter. Some 
general word-forming processes are not restricted to particu-
lar classes of words; these are the various types of reduplica-
tion and compounding.
Some word-forming processes, including some forms of 
afﬁ xation, are productive. That is, the process is not restricted 
to particular words but can be applied to new words as they 
appear in the language or to already existing words to which it 
has not been applied before. Some processes, such as inﬁ xing, 
are not productive; the process occurs only with particular 
words. Where a process is not productive, this is pointed out in 
the relevant section.
Full reduplication
Simple words (or free bases), complex words (consisting of an 
afﬁ x or more than one afﬁ x plus base) and the bases of complex 
words can be fully reduplicated. Full reduplication involves 
repeating the entire word.
1.8
1.9
1.10

 Word-forming processes 19
The resulting two bases or words are separated by a hyphen 
in writing. The second base or word is treated as the redupli-
cated part.
Examples of reduplicated free bases are buku-buku, tinggi-
tinggi, duduk-duduk.
Examples of reduplicated complex words are perubahan-
perubahan (from base ubah), tulisan-tulisan (from base tulis).
Examples of reduplicated bases within a complex word are 
kemerah-merahan (from base merah), berkali-kali (from base 
kali), sebesar-besarnya (from base besar), melihat-lihat (from 
base lihat).
Full reduplication has many functions. Sometimes redupli-
cation of bases cannot be discussed separately from a consider-
ation of the afﬁ xes with which it occurs. For instance, the function 
of the reduplication of the bases in kuda-kudaan ‘toy horse’ and 
sebesar-besarnya ‘as big as possible’ is dependent on the particu-
lar combination of base and afﬁ x and cannot be described free 
from the overall forms in which it occurs. Such reduplication is 
discussed under the individual afﬁ xes. On the other hand, most 
full reduplication of words, whether simple or complex, and 
of some bases in complex words can be described free from a 
consideration of the particular afﬁ xes accompanying it. Such 
redupli cation is discussed in the following sections.
Reduplication without corresponding single bases
Sometimes reduplicated forms have no unreduplicated counter-
parts to which they can be related. Such forms are often treated 
as single bases in dictionaries, although usually written with 
a hyphen. Such forms include labah-labah ‘spider’, tiba-tiba 
‘suddenly’, sia-sia ‘futile’, pura-pura ‘pretend’, megap-megap 
‘pant’, masing-masing ‘each’. Although single bases with the 
same form sometimes occur, these are chance similarities. Thus 
the word tiba ‘arrive’ has no relationship (at least in modern 
Indonesian) to tiba-tiba ‘suddenly’.
Reduplication of nouns
Where a noun can occur singly or repeated the redupli -
cation has a number of functions, as discussed in sections 
1.13–14.
1.11
1.12

20 Words
Some nouns consisting of repeated forms are of the type 
mentioned in section 1.11 and are thus single bases. Many of 
these words are names of plants and animals, types of food and 
instruments, although such formations are not conﬁ ned to these 
categories: cumi-cumi ‘squid’, kupu-kupu ‘butterﬂ y’, alang-
alang ‘tall grass species’, koma-koma ‘saffron’, gado-gado ‘mixed 
vegetable dish’, ani-ani ‘small harvest knife’, oleh-oleh ‘gift’. 
Sometimes a reduplicated form refers to something having two 
or more similar parts; a single base rarely or never occurs: paru-
paru ‘lungs’, baling-baling ‘propeller’, anting-anting ‘earring’.
Reduplication may produce a meaning which is different but 
nevertheless related to the meaning of the single base. Diction-
aries inconsistently list such reduplicated forms under the single 
base or as separate entries. Such forms include:
gula sugar 
gula-gula sweets
laki husband 
laki-laki man
mata eye 
mata-mata spy
kuda horse 
kuda-kuda easel; trestle
langit sky 
langit-langit ceiling
In a few cases, such words can also indicate plurality (see 1.14). 
Thus kuda-kuda ‘horses’, mata-mata rantai ‘links of a chain’.
The major function of noun reduplication is to indicate 
plurality. Both simple and complex nouns can be reduplicated 
to indicate plurality: piring-piring ‘plates’, rumah-rumah 
‘houses’, singkatan-singkatan ‘abbreviations’, perubahan-
perubahan ‘changes’.
A noun is not usually reduplicated unless it is unclear from 
context whether one or more than one is referred to and then 
only if this is important to what the speaker wishes to convey. 
In the ﬁ rst example below the number makes plurality speciﬁ c, 
while in the second sentence plurality is clear from the general 
context; one does not usually buy a single shoe:
Menteri mengunjungi tiga negeri asing.
The minister visited three foreign countries.
Saya harus membeli sepatu baru.
I must buy new shoes.
1.13
1.14

 Word-forming processes 21
Sometimes, however, a speaker does use reduplication even 
though plurality is clear from context:
 Pulau-pulau Bali, Lombok dan Sumbawa terletak di 
sebelah timur pulau Jawa.
 The islands of Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa are located east 
of Java.
Reduplication does not occur if a whole class of things is referred 
to. Neither noun in the following sentence can be reduplicated:
Anjing suka tulang.
Dogs like bones.
It is sometimes stated that reduplication of nouns indicates 
variety rather than plurality (although plurality is implied by 
variety). Indonesian writers disagree on this question, but clearly 
reduplication can be used where variety is of no importance. 
In the following sentences there is no focus at all on variation 
among the mango trees, links of the chain or water containers; 
what is stressed is that there is more than one:
Rumahnya dekat pohon-pohon mangga itu.
His house is near those mango trees.
Mata-mata rantai berbentuk bulat.
The links of the chain are round.
Pada pinggangnya terikat bumbung-bumbung kosong.
At his waist are tied empty bamboo water containers.
Reduplication is not normally used in reference to things 
which come in pairs, such as certain body parts. Where it is felt 
necessary to indicate plurality in such cases, belah ‘half; one of 
something which comes in a pair’ is usually used (see 2.26).
When a noun is followed by a modifying noun (see 2.37), 
usually only the head noun is reduplicated:
buku-buku sejarah history books
toko-toko buku bookshops
There is sometimes disagreement among Indonesians as to 
whether or not a noun and modifying noun should both be 
repeated; in some common combinations either the head noun 
alone is repeated or both are, speakers differing as to what is 

22 Words
acceptable; thus: surat-surat kabar or surat kabar-surat kabar 
‘newspapers’.
When a noun and a following possessive noun both refer to 
more than one, it is often possible to repeat either noun:
 Sebutkanlah nama-nama universitas yang termasuk 
SKALU.
 Sebutkanlah nama universitas-universitas yang termasuk 
SKALU.
Give the names of the universities in SKALU.5
Reduplication of pronouns
The following personal pronouns (see 2.66) can be redupli-
cated: saya ‘I’, kami ‘we (exclusive)’, kita ‘we (inclusive)’, kamu 
‘you’, beliau ‘he, she (respectful)’ and mereka ‘they’.
For all these except mereka, reduplication usually has a 
be littling or disparaging connotation:
 Mengapa hanya saya-saya yang selalu diberi tugas yang 
berat ini?
Why is it always poor old me who gets these hard jobs?
Jangan berbuat gaduh di sini, beliau-beliau sedang rapat!
Don’t be noisy, the big shots are having a meeting!
For mereka, reduplication conveys emphasis; the pronoun is 
usually followed by a relative clause introduced by yang:
 Mereka-mereka yang belum terdaftar harap lekas 
mendaftarkan diri.
 Those who aren’t enrolled yet should enrol as soon as 
possible.6
Reduplication of adjectives
Reduplication of an adjective usually occurs when the noun it 
describes is plural; reduplication indicates that the characteris-
tic indicated by the adjective applies to all the objects:
sekitar 230 pulau yang kecil-kecil ukurannya
about 230 small islands
hutan-rimba yang pohonnya tinggi-tinggi sekali
a forest whose trees are very tall
Gambarmu bagus-bagus.
Your drawings are beautiful.
1.15
1.16

 Word-forming processes 23
A reduplicated adjective can occur alone, functioning like a 
concessive clause introduced by meskipun (see 4.76):
Kecil-kecil, si Ali sudah pacaran.
Although young, Ali already has a girlfriend.
Sakit-sakit, dia pergi juga ke sekolah.
Although sick, he still went to school.
Reduplicated adjectives can function as adverbs (see 2.170):
Anak itu berteriak keras-keras.
The child screamed loudly.
Reduplication of verbs
Unlike complex nouns, complex verbs only undergo full redu-
plication of the base; that is, bases are repeated and afﬁ xes then 
attached to them. There are several functions.
With some verbs reduplication gives a connotation of action 
done in a casual or leisurely way:
duduk sit 
duduk-duduk sit about
berjalan walk 
berjalan-jalan walk about, go for 
a stroll
melihat see 
 melihat-lihat browse, have a look 
around
membuka open 
 membuka-buka (buku) leaf 
through (a book)
With many verbs reduplication indicates continued action, 
either an action done over a period of time or an action 
performed repeatedly:
Bu Yem mengurut-urut rambut anaknya.
Mrs Yem stroked her child’s hair (a number of times).
Potongan kayu itu terapung-apung di atas air.
The piece of wood ﬂ oated on the water.
Dia berteriak-teriak minta tolong.
He shouted and shouted for help.
Menteri menunda-nunda keberangkatannya.
The minister kept delaying his departure.

1.18

With some verbs reduplication gives a meaning somewhat 
different from that of the single form, usually conveying a sense 
of intensity:
menjadi become 
menjadi-jadi get worse
meminta request 
meminta-minta beg
membesarkan enlarge 
membesar-besarkan exaggerate
berganti replace 
 berganti-ganti alternate, keep 
changing places
Accompanied by tidak ‘not’ reduplication of the verb can 
indicate that the action has not occurred, usually implying that 
this is contrary to expectation:
Sudah dua hari Pak Tanto tidak muncul-muncul.
Mr Tanto hasn’t turned up for two days now.
 Mereka tidak menyinggung-nyinggung masalah itu di 
rapat kemarin.
They just didn’t mention the matter in the meeting yesterday.
A few verbs, including datang ‘come’, bangun ‘wake up’, pulang 
‘arrive home’, can be reduplicated to function like cor relative 
clauses introduced by begitu ‘no sooner’ (see 4.89):
Bangun-bangun mereka sudah bertengkar.
No sooner were they awake than they began to argue.
Reduplication of numbers
Reduplication of numbers forms adverbs meaning ‘in a group 
of so many’:
Bicaralah satu-satu.
Speak one at a time.
Mereka masuk dua-dua.
They came in two at a time.
The numbers can also be separated by demi or per (see 2.177). 
Numbers for ‘two’ to ‘four’ can also occur with preﬁ x ber- 
(see 1.160).
Partial reduplication
Partial reduplication occurs only with bases which begin with a 
consonant. It involves placing before the base a syllable consist-
1.22
1.23
1.24
1.25
1.26

 Word-forming processes 25
ing of the ﬁ rst consonant of the base followed by e. This type of 
reduplication is no longer productive in the language; it occurs 
with a few bases, mainly nouns, and cannot be applied to others. 
The reduplicated word has a meaning which is the same as that 
of the single form or is related to it. Sometimes, as in the ﬁ rst 
example below, the historical relationship is not obvious:
tangga ladder 
tetangga neighbour
jaka bachelor 
jejaka bachelor
laki husband 
lelaki man
luhur noble 
leluhur ancestor
tamu guest 
tetamu guest
tapi but 
tetapi but
Imitative reduplication
In imitative reduplication the two parts of the word are not 
identical, though they are similar. Nouns, adjectives and 
verbs can all undergo imitative reduplication. The variation 
between the two parts of the word can involve either conso-
nants or vowels. Imitative reduplication is not productive; 
new forms cannot be created, nor can the two parts of the 
word change places. Frequently only the ﬁ rst component of 
the word occurs as a simple word. In some cases, neither part 
can occur alone. The reduplication usually indicates variety 
or emphasises the meaning of the ﬁ rst component. Imi -
t ative reduplication is not greatly different from some types 
of compounding (see 1.31) and could alternatively be placed 
in that category.
The difference may be only the ﬁ rst consonant: sayur-mayur 
‘vegetables’ (sayur ‘vegetable’), lauk-pauk ‘side dishes’ (lauk 
‘side dish’), ramah-tamah ‘hospitable and friendly’ (ramah 
‘friendly’). Some combinations may be considered as instances 
of imitative reduplication, although they actually consist of 
two existing independent parts, such as cerai-berai ‘scattered, 
dispersed’ (cerai ‘separated’, berai ‘dispersed’) and kaya-raya 
‘very wealthy’ (kaya ‘rich’, raya ‘great’).
The difference may be in the vowels. There may be only one 
vowel difference: desas-desus ‘rumour’, warna-warni ‘all kinds

of colours’ (warna ‘colour’), gerak-gerik ‘movements, gestures’ 
(gerak ‘movement’).
Usually there are two vowel differences. It is most common 
for the ﬁ rst component to contain the vowels o…a and the 
second component to contain the vowels a…i, although these 
are not the only combinations. Often, with this type of imitative 
reduplication, neither part of the word can occur alone: bolak-
balik ‘to and fro’ (balik ‘return’), pontang-panting ‘run helter 
skelter’, obrak-abrik ‘destroy, smash to pieces’, mundar-mandir 
‘back and forth’, tindak-tanduk ‘behaviour’ (tindak ‘action’), 
asal-usul ‘origin, descent’ (asal ‘origin’), teka-teki ‘riddle’.
Compounds
A compound is a combination of two simple words which come 
together to form a complex word. Thus tanda ‘sign’ and tangan 
‘hand’ combine in the compound tandatangan ‘signature’. Not 
all compounds are written as a single word; some are usually 
hyphenated, such as pemuda-pemudi ‘young people’, while others 
are often written as two words, such as salah paham ‘misunder-
stand’. There is considerable inconsistency in the usage of differ-
ent people. It is usual for such forms to be written without a space 
or with a hyphen when they form the base for a derived word: 
kesalahpahaman, kesalah-pahaman ‘misunderstanding’.
A sequence of words may not be a compound when standing 
alone but may become such when acting as the base for an afﬁ xed 
form. Thus peti es ‘ice box’ is a phrase rather than a compound, 
but it is a compound base in the verbal form mempeti-eskan 
‘leave for later consideration’.
Some compounds resemble imitative reduplication (see 1.27–9). 
In these compounds, however, there are differences of both vowel 
and consonant; the two parts can also have different numbers 
of syllables. The parts occur as separate words, usually with 
very similar meanings. These forms are almost entirely adjec-
tives; they are similar in meaning to one or both parts alone, but 
the meaning is more intensive: gelap gulita ‘pitch dark’ (gelap 
‘dark’, gulita ‘dark’), kelam kabut ‘foggy, murky’ (kelam ‘dull, 
overcast’, kabut ‘fog’), lemah lembut ‘gentle, graceful’ (lemah 
‘weak’, lembut ‘soft’), sunyi senyap ‘deathly still’ (sunyi ‘lonely,

quiet’, senyap ‘quiet, deserted’), terang benderang ‘very bright’ 
(terang ‘bright’, benderang ‘bright’).
In one case, two consonants are different but the vowels are 
the same: pecah-belah ‘broken into pieces’ (pecah ‘broken’, 
belah ‘crack’).
A compound may consist of two words occurring as noun and 
adjective or as noun and modifying noun which are treated as a 
single unit for the purpose of afﬁ xation; that is, they combine as 
the base of a complex word. Many of these, such as kambing hitam 
‘scapegoat’, have an idiomatic meaning (kambing ‘goat’, hitam 
‘black’). As idioms they act like single words, not only combining 
for the purposes of afﬁ xation, but not being sep arable when occur-
ring without afﬁ xation. Thus, in the above example, the idiom is 
lost if the words are separated by yang; kambing yang hitam can 
only mean ‘a goat which is black’ (see also 2.45). As mentioned in 
section 1.30, some combinations, such as peti es ‘ice box’, only have 
idiomatic meaning when forming the base of a complex word.
Some compound nouns form the base for verbs, such as the 
following:
kambing hitam scapegoat 
 mengkambing-hitamkan 
put the blame on, make a 
scapegoat
tandatangan signature 
menandatangani sign
titik berat centre of gravity,  menitik-beratkan stress, 
  most important aspect  
 emphasise (titik ‘dot, point’; 
berat ‘heavy’)
A few compound nouns consist of two verb bases. These then 
form the base for complex verbs:
serah terima transfer 
menyerah-terimakan 
  (serah ‘surrender’,  
  handover, transfer 
  terima ‘receive’) 
  (authority)
Some compounds function both as intransitive and trans itive 
verbs:
ikut serta participate 
mengikutsertakan include, let 
(someone) participate

In a number of cases, two nouns can be juxtaposed to form a 
compound where the words are separated by ‘and’ in English. In 
other cases, two words of similar meaning are compounded:

Inﬁ xes
Inﬁ xation is not productive and only a limited number of 
inﬁ xed forms occur. Because of this, inﬁ xed forms are no 
longer felt by most people to contain an afﬁ x and they are listed 
separately from their bases in dictionaries. The inﬁ xes are -em-, 
-el-, -er-. The meaning of the inﬁ x is unpredictable. Inﬁ xed 
forms have the same meaning as the simple form or a meaning 
related to it:
gigi tooth 
gerigi serration
suling ﬂ ute 
seruling ﬂ ute
tapak palm, sole 
telapak sole, palm
tunjuk point 
telunjuk index ﬁ nger
getar vibrate 
gemetar tremble
A few forms inﬁ xed with -em- occur only as a redupli cation of 
the base form of the word. Such words convey a meaning which 
is similar to that of the base alone or which is an intensity of the 
meaning of the base:
kilau shine 
kilau-kemilau shine brightly
tali rope 
tali-temali all sorts of rope
turun descend 
turun-temurun hereditary

In at least one case, the base does not occur alone: gilang-gemi-

AFFIXES
In the following sections of this chapter the preﬁ xes, sufﬁ xes and 
circumﬁ xes of the language are described. When the function 
of an afﬁ x can be adequately described without reference to 
context, single words are given as examples. When it is neces-
sary to include a discussion of context in the description of an 
afﬁ x, examples are given in context.
There are two types of afﬁ x, according to function: derivational 
and inﬂ ectional. When a derivational afﬁ x is attached to a base, it 
changes the word to another class; that is, it derives another class. 
An inﬂ ectional afﬁ x does not change the category of the word. 
Most afﬁ xes in Indonesian are derivational. The important inﬂ ec-
tional afﬁ xes are the voice afﬁ xes meN- and di-, which are attached 
to transitive verbs to signal whether they are active or passive.
Afﬁ xes can occur in combination. Thus the word memper -
besar ‘enlarge’ contains base besar ‘large’ with preﬁ xes meN- 
and per-.
A circumﬁ x must be distinguished from a combination of 
preﬁ x and sufﬁ x. Thus berpakaian ‘clothed, wearing clothes’ 
consists of preﬁ x ber- ‘have, wear’ and base pakaian ‘clothes’. This 
in turn consists of base pakai ‘wear’ and sufﬁ x -an. On the other 
hand, berdatangan ‘come in random fashion’ consists of circum-
ﬁ x ber-…-an ‘do in random manner’ and base datang ‘come’.
Most of the afﬁ xes described in the remainder of this chapter are 
indigenous, while a few are borrowings from other languages. A 
number of other afﬁ xes now occurring in the language are not 
discussed here, such as -isme, as in kolonialisme ‘colonialism’, 
and -itas, as in stabilitas ‘stability’. These are generally recent 
acquisitions from European languages, attached to bases which 
are also borrowed from European languages. While some 
are common in the speech of educated people, they are not 
regarded as sufﬁ ciently assimilated for inclusion here. However, 
1.38

commonly occurring afﬁ xes borrowed from Sanskrit and Arabic 
are included.
In a number of words borrowed from Sanskrit, male and female 
forms, are distinguished, the former ending in a and the latter in 
i. The distinction has been extended to a few native words. The 
form with a is sometimes general, applying both to males and 
females, while the form with i is always feminine. This ending is 
not a sufﬁ x, as the word cannot occur without it:
dewa god, deity 
dewi goddess
pemuda youth 
pemudi young female
pramugara air steward 
pramugari air stewardess
putra son; prince 
putri daughter; princess
saudara relative of same 
saudari you (to female)
  generation; you
The only afﬁ xes which make a gender distinction are -wan and 
-wati (see 1.105).
In the following discussion, afﬁ xes are grouped according to the 
class of word they derive. The ‘parts of speech’ referred to, noun, 
verb and so on, are described in Chapter 2. When discussing the 
meaning of afﬁ xes, it is sometimes convenient to use the symbol 
[base] to indicate that the meaning of any relevant base can 
occur in that position. Thus, in section 1.59 the meaning of -an is 
described as apa yang di-[base] ‘what is [base]ed’. With the base 
makan this becomes apa yang dimakan ‘what is eaten’.
Derivation of nouns
A considerable number of afﬁ xes can be attached to bases to 
derive nouns. Nouns are further discussed in section 2.3.
Preﬁ x peN-
This preﬁ x is attached to verbs and some other words to derive 
nouns with several closely related meanings. With some bases 
peN- alternates with pe-, as discussed in section 1.53.
peN- is attached to verbal bases to derive nouns indicating a person 
who carries out the action expressed by the base. Corresponding 
verbs are given for comparison in the following examples:

 Afﬁ xes 31
menganut follow 
penganut follower, adherent
menonton view 
penonton spectator
menulis write 
penulis writer
menumpang ride in 
penumpang passenger
menduduki occupy 
penduduk inhabitant
peN- also derives nouns referring to inanimate objects, usually 
the instrument with which the action is performed. Such 
forms frequently modify another noun (see 2.37) or are them-
selves modiﬁ ed by another noun, as shown in the following 
examples:
membangkitkan generate 
pembangkit (listrik) 
(electricity) generator
mempersatukan unify 
pemersatu uniﬁ er
mencetak print 
(mesin) pencetak printer
menenangkan calm 
(obat) penenang sedative
mengendalikan control 
(menara) pengendali control 
(tower)
menggaris draw a line 
penggaris ruler
menutup shut 
penutup (botol) (bottle) top
merangsang stimulate 
perangsang stimulant
A peN- noun can sometimes mean either a person who performs 
the action or an instrument with which the action is performed, 
depending on context:
mencetak print 
pencetak printer (person or 
instrument)
mendengarkan listen 
pendengar listener; (alat) 
pendengar hearing aid
menjebak trap, snare 
penjebak trapper; trap
A few peN- nouns are based not on verbs but on other parts of 
speech, usually adjectives. These refer to someone or something 
associated with the base:
besar big 
pembesar important person
jahat bad 
penjahat criminal
mabuk intoxicated 
pemabuk drunk (person)
muda young 
pemuda youth
sakit sick 
penyakit illness
sebab cause 
penyebab cause

A number of other forms based on adjectives, such as pemalu 
‘shy person’, are often interpreted as nouns but bear more resem-
blance to adjectives. These are described in sections 1.119–22.
Preﬁ x pe-
This preﬁ x derives nouns indicating a person who carries out 
the action expressed by the base. It occurs with a limited number 
of bases.
pe- derives nouns indicating a person who carries out the action 
indicated by the corresponding ber- verb. It only occurs with 
bases which begin with a consonant:
bekerja work 
pekerja worker
berdagang trade 
pedagang trader, merchant
berjalan walk 
pejalan (kaki) pedestrian
berziarah go on pilgrimage peziarah pilgrim
pe- nouns sometimes refer to sporting activities. Some of these 
have no corresponding ber- verbs:
berenang swim 
perenang swimmer
bergulat wrestle 
pegulat wrestler
bertinju box 
petinju boxer
bulu tangkis badminton 
pebulu tangkis badminton 
player
tenis tennis 
petenis tennis player
In a few cases, both peN- and pe- nouns occur with the same 
base, having the same or very similar meanings:
bersaing, menyaingi 
pesaing, penyaing 
  compete  
  competitor
bersulap, menyulap 
pesulap, penyulap
  conjure 
  conjurer
cinta, mencintai love 
pecinta, pencinta lover
peN- and pe- may both occur but with different meaning. Some-
times peN- indicates one who performs the action (the actor), 
being related to a verb with preﬁ x meN-, while pe- indicates one 
who undergoes the action (the patient—see 3.17), being related 
to a verb with preﬁ x di-:

penyuruh one who gives 
pesuruh messenger, one who 
  orders (menyuruh order)    takes orders (disuruh

In a few cases, both forms occur with different meanings which 
are not related to actor and patient:
penjabat (menteri)  
pejabat ofﬁ cial (menjabat 
  acting (minister)  
  hold ofﬁ ce)
penyerta companion 
peserta participant (ikut serta
  (menyertai accompany)    participate)
With some bases N is lost from peN- (see 1.5). With such bases 
the preﬁ x can only be determined by the corresponding verb. 
Thus pelukis ‘painter’ has preﬁ x peN-, corresponding to melukis 
‘paint’, while pelari ‘runner’ has preﬁ x pe-, relating to berlari ‘run’. 
The preﬁ x in pelatih ‘trainer, coach’ is peN- as the word relates to 
melatih ‘train (someone)’, not to berlatih ‘train, practise’.
Preﬁ x per-
This preﬁ x occurs with a very few nouns. It often occurs before 
bases with an initial vowel and in these instances could be 
regarded as a variant of preﬁ x pe-:
pelajar student (belajar study)
perantara intermediary, go-between (berantara be spaced)
pe(r)tanda sign, indication
pertapa hermit, ascetic (bertapa live as an ascetic)
In several cases there is contrast with peN-; thus pelajar ‘student’ 
and pengajar ‘instructor, teacher’ (mengajar teach).
Sufﬁ x -an
Sufﬁ x -an derives nouns from verbs and, to a lesser extent, 
from nouns, adjectives and other classes. It also co-occurs with 
full and partial reduplication. It has a number of different 
functions.
1.55
1.56
1.57

34 Words
Sufﬁ x -an most commonly attaches to verb bases, several differ-
ent meanings being distinguishable.
With many verb bases it produces a noun which stands as object 
(see 3.19) of the action indicated by the verb. There is there-
fore always an associated transitive verb. The meaning is often 
expressed in Indonesian as apa yang di-[base] ‘what is [base]-
ed’, where [base] is the meaning of the verb base. Thus makanan 
‘food’ is apa yang dimakan ‘what is eaten’, pakaian ‘clothes’ is 
apa yang dipakai ‘what is worn’.
This is a large, productive set of nouns, including:
lukisan picture 
minuman drink
tulisan writing 
kenalan acquaintance
ukiran carving 
pinjaman loan
sumbangan contribution 
pilihan choice
tanaman plant 
tujuan destination
While these nouns all relate to the object of the corresponding 
verb, further subgrouping on semantic grounds is possible. Thus 
some nouns refer to something which results from the action, 
such as tulisan ‘writing’ and ukiran ‘carving’, while others refer 
to something already existing which is subjected to the action, 
such as makanan ‘food’ and minuman ‘drink’.
One subset of -an nouns with verb bases typically act as modi-
ﬁ ers to another noun (see 2.37), although some can occur alone 
with the same meaning. They tend to be translated by adjectives 
in English:
(barang) curian stolen (goods)
(binatang) buruan game (animal)
(budak) belian bought (slave)
(rumah) sewaan rented (house)
(sapi) perahan milch (cow)
Another important subset with verb bases are action nouns 
(see 2.53). These describe the action of the verb and can occur 
as head of a phrase containing prepositions such as terhadap. 
Thus serangan ‘attack’, as in the noun phrase serangan terhadap 
musuh ‘an attack on the enemy’, expresses the same action as the 
1.58
1.59
1.60
1.61
1.62

 Afﬁ xes 35
verb menyerang ‘attack’, as in the construction Mereka meny-
erang musuh ‘They attacked the enemy’. This is also a large, 
productive set of nouns and includes:
ancaman threat 
tentangan challenge
balasan response 
kecaman criticism
bantuan help 
tuntutan demand
keluhan complaint 
tekanan pressure
larangan prohibition 
tembakan shooting
With some verb bases -an derives nouns indicating the instru-
ment with which the action is performed or the place where the 
action occurs. With some nouns the instrumental or locative 
meaning is clear, while for others either interpretation is 
possible. Thus timbangan ‘scales’ can be interpreted as either 
the instrument with which one weighs (menimbang ‘weigh’) or 
the place where weighing takes place:
ayunan cradle 
gilingan mill
kendaraan vehicle 
bendungan dam
saluran channel 
parkiran parking place
angkutan transport 
pikulan carrying pole
boncengan pillion, bicycle 
gantungan hanger (for 
  rack  
  clothes)
-an can also occur with noun bases. Sometimes it has the same 
meaning as the base, or a meaning which varies only slightly 
from that of the base, such as peran, peranan ‘role’, while with 
other words there is a clear difference in meaning. It may indicate 
a magniﬁ cation of the base, thus laut ‘sea’, lautan ‘ocean’. It 
may have the same meaning as the base but with an additional 
extension of that meaning; thus pinggir ‘edge’, pinggiran ‘edge, 
outskirts’. In some cases the difference in meaning is unpredict-
able, such as akhir ‘end’, akhiran ‘sufﬁ x’:
darat (dry) land 
daratan mainland
gambar picture 
gambaran description
keluh sigh, groan 
keluhan groan, complaint
pasar market 
pasaran (international) 
market
ruang space, room 
ruangan space, (large) room
kawan friend, companion 
kawanan herd, ﬂ ock

kubang, kubangan mudhole
landas, landasan base, substratum
gugus, gugusan group, cluster
One group of -an nouns based on nouns derive words which do 
not differ in meaning from the base but have a different distri-
bution. The base alone typically occurs as a partitive (see 2.29) 
indicating a natural or artiﬁ cial grouping or piece of something, 
and is always preceded by a number, most commonly se- ‘one’. 
The -an form occurs as the head of a noun phrase and can have 
a noun modiﬁ er (see 2.37). Typically, both constructions have 
the same translation in English:
sederet rumah, deretan rumah
a row of houses
Dia membawa seikat jerami/Dia membawa ikatan jerami.
He was carrying a bundle of hay.
While the base usually occurs in a partitive construction with a 
preceding number, and is thus always indeﬁ nite, the -an form 
can be speciﬁ c, occurring without a number, either alone or 
with a determiner:
deretan itu that row
ikatan ini this bundle
Other examples of -an nouns include the following (they have 
the same translation as their corresponding base):
gugusan group, cluster 
lembaran sheet, page
jajaran row, line 
pasangan pair
timbunan heap, pile  
rangkaian series
kepingan chip, fragment 
Sufﬁ x -an can occur with a reduplicated noun base. There are 
two major functions.
The word can indicate a variety of what is indicated by the base. 
This formation is especially common with words for plants:
obat-obatan medicines
pohon-pohonan (all kinds of) trees

daun-daunan foliage
rumput-rumputan grasses, weeds
sayur-sayuran vegetables
umbi-umbian (various) edible tubers
buah-buahan fruits
tari-tarian (various kinds of) dances
The word can indicate a diminutive or something which resem-
bles or imitates what the base speciﬁ es. With this function the 
construction is quite productive and people often create new 
forms to refer to toys:
mobil-mobilan toy car
rumah-rumahan doll’s house
bulan-bulanan target
kuda-kudaan toy horse, hobbyhorse
kapal-kapalan toy boat
perang-perangan manoeuvres
burung-burungan toy bird
orang-orangan puppet; scarecrow
A few of the forms that are described in section 1.67 with full 
reduplication of the base can alternatively occur with partial 
reduplication:
pepohonan trees
rerumputan weeds
dedaunan foliage, greenery
A few forms, with either full or partial reduplication, have verbal 
bases:
reruntuhan ruins (runtuh collapse)
 tumbuh-tumbuhan, tetumbuhan (all sorts of) plants 
  (tumbuh grow)
goreng-gorengan fried foods (goreng fry)
sesajian (temple) offerings (saji offer)

kecantikan beauty
sehat healthy

In general, the meaning of the noun can be predicted from the 
meaning of the adjective base. In a few cases this is not so:
berat heavy 
keberatan objection
malu shy 
kemaluan genitals
terang clear 
keterangan explanation
The negative tidak ‘not’ can combine with some adjectives to

A few nouns are formed from a negated verb or have a compound 
verb base:

keikut-sertaan participation
A few ke-…-an nouns are based on modals (see 2.153) or 
adverbs:

keharusan necessity, a must
kerap frequently 
kekerapan frequency

kelebihan excess

ke-…-an nouns can be based on nouns; this use is very produc-

forms in general mean ‘having to do with [base]’. Some forms 
have a different translation from the base:

Many ke-…-an nouns with noun bases typically modify 
another noun. Thus keagamaan ‘having to do with religion’ 
occurs in such phrases as upacara keagamaan ‘religious 
ceremony’. Sometimes the translation depends on context; thus 
kebangsaan is translated differently in the phrases kebang-
saan kapal itu ‘nationality of the ship’ and lagu kebangsaan 
‘national song’. When modifying another noun it is frequently 
translated by an adjective, as in the case of keagamaan above. 
In other cases, the ke-…-an noun has the same translation as 
the base. Thus penduduk ‘population’ and (teori) kependudu-
kan ‘population (theory)’. In either case, such nouns are best 
glossed ‘having to do with [base]’, except where context makes 
their meaning clear, as in the following examples:
kedokteran medical,  
fakultas kedokteran faculty 
  having to do with doctors    of medicine
kehutanan forestry, having petugas kehutanan forestry 
  to do with forests  
  ofﬁ cial

In a few cases, ke-…-an nouns are formed from nouns 
already having prefix peN-, such as kependudukan ‘having 
to do with population’ (penduduk population, menduduki 
occupy) and kepemimpinan leadership (pemimpin leader, 
pimpin lead).

kesebelasan eleven (soccer 
team)

Circumﬁ x peN-…-an
Most nouns with peN-…-an have verbal bases. They refer to 
the action expressed by the corresponding transitive verb and 
are often translatable as ‘the act of doing what the verb refers 
to’. They can occur with an indication of length of time or with 
such verbs as dilakukan ‘carried out’. In the ﬁ rst example below, 
penulisan ‘the act of writing, the writing’ relates to menulis 
‘write’; in the second, pengumpulan ‘the act of collecting’ 
relates to mengumpulkan ‘collect’, and so on:
Penulisan buku itu memerlukan dua tahun.
The writing of that book took two years.
Pengumpulan cerita-cerita itu dilakukan di New York.
The collecting of these stories was done in New York.
 Amerika Serikat telah menghentikan pengiriman bahan 
makanan.
The USA has stopped the sending of foodstuffs.

 Kedua kepala negara menyaksikan penandatanganan 
perjanjian kerja sama.
 The two heads of state witnessed the signing of the 
cooper ation agreement.
In the above examples, the peN-…-an nouns are all translated 
by ‘-ing’ verbs. Some peN-…-an nouns, however, usually corre-
spond to English nouns which also translate corresponding -an 
nouns (see 1.59). Thus, while penerjemahan can be translated 
‘the translating’, it is more common for ‘translation’ to occur in 
English, which also translates terjemahan. On the other hand, 
some -an nouns are translated with ‘-ing’ verbs; thus tulisan 
and penulisan both translate ‘writing’. However, the meanings 
of the two are always distinct, the peN-…-an noun referring 
to the action, the -an noun referring to the result of the action. 
This is further discussed in section 1.116.
This is a productive afﬁ xation and applies very freely to tran-
sitive verbs:
pelaksanaan implementation, implementing
pembacaan reading
pencetakan printing
penembakan shooting
pengecekan checking (of facts)
pengiriman dispatch(ing), sending
pengusiran expulsion, expelling
penjualan selling
Where meN- co-occurs with preﬁ xes per- (see 1.234ff) and 
ber- (see 1.199), so too can peN-…-an. If meN- also occurs 
without those afﬁ xes, contrasting peN-…-an nouns some-
times also occur. Preceded by peN-, the initial p of per- is lost 
(see 1.6):
memberlakukan apply 
pemberlakuan application 
  (rules)  
  (of rules)
memperoleh get, acquire 
pemerolehan process of 
acquiring
memberhentikan dismiss 
pemberhentian dismissal, cf.
menghentikan stop 
penghentian stopping, 
cessation

Nouns derived with peN-…-an can also correspond to intransi-
tive verbs with preﬁ x meN- (see 1.179). If there is an intransitive 
meN- verb and a transitive verb having the same base, there 
may be peN-…-an nouns corresponding to each of them. Thus 
penyerahan ‘(act of) surrendering, the surrender’ corresponds 
both to intransitive menyerah ‘surrender, give in’ and transitive 
menyerahkan ‘surrender, hand over, transfer’:
Penyerahan tentara Jepang terjadi bulan Agustus.
The surrender of the Japanese army occurred in August.
Penyerahan surat-surat itu dituntut oleh jaksa.
 The handing over of the documents was demanded by the 
prosecutor.
Other examples of peN-…-an nouns relating to both transitive 
and intransitive verbs are:
pendaratan landing 
mendarat land (intr.), 
mendaratkan land (trans.)
pendaftaran registration 
mendaftar register (intr.), 
mendaftarkan register 
(trans.)
If two different transitive verbs have the same base, there may be 
a peN-…-an noun corresponding to each of the verbs:
menerangi light, illuminate penerangan lighting, 
 
  illumination
menerangkan explain 
penerangan explanation
menembak shoot (someone) penembakan shooting (of 
 
  someone)
menembakkan ﬁ re (a bullet) penembakan ﬁ ring (of a 
 
  bullet)
However, in some cases a peN-…-an noun may correspond to 
only one of them:
penemuan discovery 
menemukan discover, cf. 
menemui meet
1.89
1.90

44 Words
pembangunan development membangun develop, cf. 
membangunkan wake up
In some cases, a peN-…-an noun corresponds to the object 
of an action as well as, or instead of, corresponding to the act. 
Thus penemuan means ‘discovery’ in the sense of ‘something 
discovered’ as well as ‘the act of discovering’. Some nouns, like 
pengetahuan ‘knowledge (what is known)’ and peninggalan 
‘remains; inheritance (what is left behind)’, relate only to the 
object of the verb. Other nouns which relate to the object of the 
corresponding verb include:
memandang view, observe pemandangan view, scenery
mengumumkan announce pengumuman announcement
A number of peN-…-an nouns refer to the place where the 
action of the corresponding verb typically occurs. They usually 
also relate to the action:
menggiling mill 
penggilingan mill (place); act 
of milling
mencuci wash 
pencucian laundry; act of 
washing
membuang exile 
pembuangan place of exile; 
act of exiling
membakar burn 
pembakaran place for 
burning; act of burning
menginap spend the night penginapan lodging, inn
Circumﬁ x per-…-an
Many nouns with this afﬁ xation relate to verbs with preﬁ x ber-. 
They indicate the process or result of the action referred to by 
the corresponding verb:

mencoba try 
percobaan experiment;

memohon request

corresponding verb occurs:
berhenti stop 
perhentian stopping place
berjudi gamble 
perjudian place for gambling
mencetak print 
percetakan printery
menenun weave 
pertenunan textile mill
Verbs with preﬁ x per- (see 1.234ff) always have associated 
nouns with per-…-an, never with -an (see 1.57ff). While such 
nouns are listed here as having circumﬁ x per-… -an, one could 
also say that they retain verbal preﬁ x per- and then have sufﬁ x 
-an attached:
memperbaiki repair,  
perbaikan repairs, 
  improve

memperhatikan pay 
perhatian attention
  attention to
memperhitungkan calculate 
perhitungan calculation
mempertimbangkan consider pertimbangan consideration
per-…-an nouns with noun bases may indicate ‘having to do 
with [base], affairs dealing with [base]’:

As is the case with abstract ke-…-an nouns (1.81–2), many of 
these forms based on nouns occur attributive to other nouns. 
While they literally mean ‘having to do with [base]’, they are 
usually translated by the same word as the base. The following 
examples occur as modiﬁ ers to other nouns:
buruh worker

Some per-…-an nouns with noun bases indicate ‘a collection of 
[base]’ or ‘the place where a large number of [base] are found’:
air water 
perairan waters
alat instrument 
peralatan equipment
bukit hill 
perbukitan hilly region
gelang bracelet 
pergelangan ankle/wrist
istilah term 
peristilahan terminology
pustaka book (archaic)

Some per-…-an nouns mean both ‘affairs to do with [base]’ 
(see 1.98) and ‘place where a large number of [base] are found/
collection of [base]’ (see 1.99):

The different meanings are made clear in context:

Dia ingin mendapat pekerjaan di bidang peternakan.
She wants to get a job in animal husbandry.
Ayahnya mengurus perkebunan teh.
Her father manages a tea plantation.
Ayahnya pejabat di jawatan perkebunan.
Her father is an ofﬁ cial in the horticulture ofﬁ ce.
Some per-…-an nouns with noun bases have a meaning the

Circumﬁ x pe-…-an
The number of nouns with this afﬁ x is limited. It occurs 
unpredictably with some bases instead of per-…-an. (In 
contexts where the r of per- is regularly lost, as in peternakan 
‘animal farm’ (see 1.4), per-…-an is recognised as occurring.) 
Most pe-…-an nouns are based on nouns and indicate ‘the 
place where a large number of [base] occur’. A few also mean 
‘affairs to do with [base]’ or are used as attributes meaning 
‘having to do with [base]’. Several have bases which are 
not nouns:
dalam inside 
pedalaman interior, inland
desa village 
pedesaan rural; rural area
gunung mountain 
pegunungan mountain range
jagal butcher 
pejagalan abattoir
bertualang undertake 
petualangan adventure
  adventure 
menggadaikan pawn 
pegadaian pawn shop
With some bases both per-…-an and pe-…-an occur, with the 
same meaning. Some speakers use only one or the other:
bermukim reside 
permukiman, pemukiman 
 
  settlement
dupa incense 
perdupaan, pedupaan censer, 
 
  incense burner
kubur grave 
perkuburan, pekuburan 
 
  cemetery
sawah rice ﬁ eld 
persawahan, pesawahan rice 
 
  cultivation; cluster of rice ﬁ elds
Sufﬁ xes -wan, -wati, -man
The sufﬁ x -wan occurs with bases, most of which are nouns 
ending in a vowel or h. It forms nouns indicating a person who 
is regularly associated with [base].
harta wealth, property 
hartawan wealthy person

ilmuwan scientist
olahraga sport 
olahragawan sportsman/

Sufﬁ xes -wan and -wati, both borrowed from Sanskrit, are 
the only afﬁ xes in the language which make a gender distinc-
tion (see also 1.42). The form -wan refers to both male and 
female unless it is contrasted with -wati, which is speciﬁ cally 
feminine:
karya work 
karyawati female worker
seni art 
seniwati female artist
sukarela voluntary 
sukarelawati (also relawati) 
female volunteer
wisuda graduation 
wisudawati graduating female
The sufﬁ x -man derives one noun:
seni art 
seniman artist
Sufﬁ xes -anda, -nda
These are added to a number of pronouns and kin terms to form 
honoriﬁ cs; that is, forms of address which show respect. Sufﬁ x 
-anda is added to bases ending in a consonant and -nda to bases 
ending in a vowel. In most cases a base loses ﬁ nal k, resulting in 
a ﬁ nal vowel, which is then followed by -nda:
anak 
anakanda (less common) 
ananda child
kakak 
kakanda older sibling
ayah 
ayahanda father
nenek 
nenenda grandmother
ibu 
ibunda mother
adik 
adinda younger sibling

Preﬁ x ter-
This is essentially a verbal preﬁ x (see 1.265), but it also occurs 
with a small group of nouns used in legal proceedings, such as 
terdakwa ‘accused person’:
Satu demi satu para terdakwa dijatuhi hukuman penjara.
One by one the accused were sentenced to jail.
Compare also:
tergugat the accused
terhukum person who has been sentenced
terpidana convicted person
tersangka the suspect
tertuduh the accused
Preﬁ x pra-
Preﬁ x pra- ‘pre-’ is a borrowing from Sanskrit:
sejarah history  
prasejarah prehistory
sangka supposition  
prasangka prejudice
kata word  
prakata foreword, preface
syarat condition  
prasyarat precondition
Comparison of noun-forming afﬁ xes
While generalisations can be made about the functions of all 
noun-forming afﬁ xes there are always exceptions, words which 
can only be placed in a category with difﬁ culty or not at all. 
Many irregularities and minor functions of afﬁ xes are not 
considered in the above sections.
Further, there is not always a clear-cut distinction between the 
functions of two afﬁ xes. The result is that a particular base 
might take two afﬁ xes with little or no difference in meaning. 
Thus, while peN- usually occurs with verb bases (see 1.45) and 
-wan with noun bases (see 1.105), there are a few bases which 
allow both afﬁ xes to occur, with the same meaning:
pirsa 
pemirsa, pirsawan television 
viewer
usaha 
pengusaha, usahawan business 
person
1.110
1.111
1.112
1.113

 Afﬁ xes 51
In some cases a word is derived with one of two afﬁ xes, the 
choice being unpredictable for a particular base, as seen from 
the following pairs:
menolong help 
pertolongan help, assistance
membantu help 
bantuan help, assistance
Sometimes the difference in meaning between two derived forms 
depends on whether the form relates directly to the meaning of 
the base or to the meaning of another derived form. This is the 
case with the pair ke-…-an and peN-…-an.
The meaning of the former relates immediately to the 
meaning of the adjective base (see 1.73), while the meaning of 
the latter relates to the meaning of the corresponding transitive 
verb (see 1.87). Thus:
bersih clean 
kebersihan cleanliness
membersihkan make 
pembersihan (act of) cleansing
  clean
bebas free 
kebebasan freedom
membebaskan release,  
pembebasan (act of) liberating
  liberate
Afﬁ xes -an and peN-…-an frequently have the same verbal base. 
In such cases, the meaning of -an usually relates to the object 
of the action (apa yang di-[base]—see 1.59), while peN-…-an 
relates to the action itself (see 1.187):
menerjemahkan 
terjemahan translation, 
  translate  
  translated text or speech;
  penerjemahan act of translating
menabung save 
tabungan savings, saved money;
  penabungan act of saving 
  (the saving of money)
menulis write

last year.
Where per-…-an and peN-…-an nouns have the same base, the 
former usually relates to a ber- intransitive verb while the latter 
relates to a meN- transitive verb. Thus perkembangan ‘devel-
opment’ relates to intransitive berkembang ‘develop, expand’: 
perkembangan bahasa Indonesia ‘the development of Indo-
nesian’ relates to Bahasa Indonesia berkembang ‘Indonesian 
develops’, while pengembangan ‘development, the developing 
(of something)’ relates to mengembangkan ‘develop, build’: 
pengembangan bahasa Indonesia ‘the development of Indo-
nesian’ relates to (Mereka) mengembangkan bahasa Indonesia 
‘(They) develop Indonesian’. Other examples are:
perbuatan action, act  
berbuat do
pembuatan (the act of)   
membuat make
  making
perkumpulan association  berkumpul gather
pengumpulan collecting 
mengumpulkan collect
Derivation of adjectives
The majority of adjectives consist of free bases, as discussed 
in section 2.98. A limited number of adjectives are derived 
forms.
Preﬁ x peN-
Preﬁ x peN- usually occurs with verb bases to derive nouns indi-
cating one who carries out the action described by the base (see 
1.46). It also occurs with adjective bases indicating human char-
acteristics. These words are usually translated by nouns indicat-
ing one who is regularly identiﬁ ed with the characteristic:
diam quiet 
pendiam quiet person
malas lazy 
pemalas lazy person
malu shy 
pemalu shy person
marah angry 
pemarah hothead
riang cheerful 
periang cheerful person

 Afﬁ xes 53
While these words are translated by nouns, they actually behave 
more like adjectives. Thus they can be coordinated with adjec-
tives:
Kakak saya seorang yang tenang dan pendiam.
My older sister is a calm and quiet person.
They are negated by tidak, not bukan:
Dia tidak pemarah.
He’s not hot-tempered.
They can follow yang, which is common with adjectives but 
rare with nouns (see 3.101):
Dia bukan orang yang pemalu.
She’s not a bashful person.
They can be preceded by such modifying adverbs as terlalu ‘too’, 
paling ‘most’, begitu ‘so’, agak ‘rather’, and followed by such 
adverbs as sekali ‘very’ (see 2.100):
Pangeran Edward terlalu pendiam.
Prince Edward is too quiet/a too quiet person.
A few peN- forms based on adjectives do not behave as described 
in section 1.120 but act like nouns (see 1.49).
A few peN- adjectives are based on verbs:
tidur sleep 
penidur sleepyhead
menangis cry 
penangis cry-baby
lupa forget 
pelupa forgetful person
memilih choose 
pemilih particular, choosy
These also behave like adjectives, as described in section 1.120:
Anda pelupa sekali.
You are a really forgetful person.
Pasar musik Hong Kong sangat pemilih.
The Hong Kong music market is very choosy.
Circumﬁ x ke-…-an
This occurs with a small number of common adjectives and 
with banyak and lebih to indicate excess, being synonymous 
with terlalu ‘too’:
1.120
1.121
1.122

kekecilan too small
mahal expensive 
kemahalan too expensive
manis sweet 
kemanisan too sweet
tua old 
ketuaan too old
banyak much 
kebanyakan too much
lebih more 
kelebihan excessive, too much
This function of ke-…-an is borrowed from Javanese and is not 
considered standard by all educated speakers:
Baju ini kebesaran bagi saya.
This shirt is too big for me.
Kamu kebanyakan uang.
You have too much money.
Occurring with a limited number of reduplicated noun and 
adjective bases, ke-…-an forms adjectives meaning ‘possessing 
to some degree the characteristic indicated by [base]’. It most 
commonly occurs with colour terms, such as kemerah-mera-
han ‘reddish’:
Warna kemejanya kuning kemerah-merahan.
His shirt is a reddish yellow.
Compare furthermore:
kebiru-biruan bluish
kegelap-gelapan rather dark
kegila-gilaan slightly crazy
kekuning-kuningan yellowish
With noun bases it usually has a negative connotation:
kebarat-baratan westernised (acting like a European)
keilmu-ilmuan quasi-scientiﬁ c
Some speakers allow an unreduplicated base with colour terms 
and some other adjectives:
kehijauan greenish
keperakan silvery
kepucatan rather pale
In the case of keemasan ‘golden’, reduplication of the base does 
not occur.
1.124

Reduplication does not occur if the base is already redupli-
cated:

kekanak-kanakan childish

kelaki-lakian mannish (of a 
woman)
malu-malu shy 
kemalu-maluan rather shy
Sufﬁ xes -i, -wi, -iah
The sufﬁ x -i/-wi derives adjectives from nouns. It is very limited 
in application, occurring only with some words borrowed from 
Sanskrit and Arabic. The variant -i follows a ﬁ nal consonant 
and -wi follows a ﬁ nal vowel:
alam the world, nature 
alami natural
dunia world 
duniawi worldly (hal-hal 
duniawi worldly matters)
hewan animal 
hewani bestial, relating to 
animals
Islam Islam 
Islami Islamic
manusia human 
manusiawi humane
surga heaven 
surgawi heavenly
With some words an alternative sufﬁ x -iah occurs:
alami, alamiah natural
badani, badaniah physical, bodily
Special forms occur with base bumi ‘world’: bumiawi ‘earthly, 
terrestrial’, and with roh ‘spirit’: rohani, rohaniah ‘spiritual’.
Preﬁ x se-
One function of se- with nouns is to form adjectives meaning 
‘sharing [base], having the same [base]’, where the base is a 
noun. There are two distributions for these forms. They may 
occur in a noun phrase, following the noun and preceding a 
possessor:
Dia teman sekelas saya.
He is a classmate of mine.
rekan sekamarnya
his room-mate
1.126
1.127

56 Words
The possessor may be absent if it is clear from context:
Dia pergi dengan dua puluh delapan orang senasib.
 He went with twenty-eight people who had suffered the 
same fate.
Alternatively, the se-[base] form may occur as a predicate and be 
followed by an accompaniment phrase beginning with dengan 
‘with’ (see 2.210):
Dia sekelas dengan saya.
He’s in the same class as me.
Anaknya sepantaran dengan anak saya.
Her child is about the same age as my child.
Other words in this group include:
searah (dengan) having the same direction/purpose (as)
seimbang (dengan) in balance (with)
sekantor (dengan) sharing an ofﬁ ce (with)
selaras (dengan) in harmony (with)
sependapat (dengan) of the same opinion (as)
seranjang (dengan) sharing a bed (with)
setara (dengan) equal (to), matching, on the same level (as)
With adjectives, preﬁ x se- forms equative adjective phrases. 
These are discussed in section 2.103.
The combination of se- and a noun sometimes forms an adjec-
tive meaning ‘all, the whole [base]’, being equivalent to seluruh 
‘whole’. Thus se-Asia ‘all-Asia’, as in konperensi pangan se-Asia 
‘all-Asia food conference’:
se-Indonesia all-Indonesia
sedunia (whole) world
(orang) sekampung the whole village
Sufﬁ x -an
With measures of time, weight and distance, -an forms 
adjectives meaning ‘done, happening, appearing once in the 
measure indicated by the base’. Thus, tahun ‘year’ is the base 
for tahunan ‘annual, yearly’, as in ujian tahunan ‘annual 
exam’:
1.128
1.129

 Afﬁ xes 57

Nouns such as koran ‘newspaper’ and majalah ‘magazine’ 
are frequently omitted when followed by harian ‘daily’ and 
mingguan ‘weekly’, these words then acting as nouns:
(koran) harian daily (paper)
(majalah) mingguan weekly (magazine)
With some noun bases denoting something unpleasant or 
inconvenient, -an derives adjectives meaning ‘having many 
[base], containing many [base]’ or ‘suffering from [base]’:
cacing worm 
cacingan infested with worms
jamur fungus, mould 
jamuran mouldy
kudis scabies 
kudisan suffering from scabies
semut ant 
semutan suffer pins and 
needles
uban grey hair 
ubanan grey-haired
Preﬁ x tuna-
The preﬁ x tuna- ‘without’ is a borrowing from Sanskrit. It is 
often written as a separate word and it usually occurs with bases 
which are themselves from Sanskrit, to produce euphem isms 
for more common terms:
karya work  
tunakarya, tuna karya 
unemployed
susila decent, moral  
tunasusila, tuna susila immoral
wisma building, house  
tunawisma, tuna wisma 
homeless
diri self  
tuna diri without personality
Preﬁ x antar-
This is a borrowing from Sanskrit, meaning ‘inter-’:
bangsa people, nation  
antarbangsa international
budaya culture  
antarbudaya cross-cultural
pulau island  
antarpulau inter-island

Derivation of adverbs and adjuncts
Adjuncts are components of a clause which give infor mation 
about such matters as place, time, frequency and manner (see 
2.165ff). The term ‘adverb’ is used here to refer to adjuncts of 
manner (see 2.166) and modifying adverbs within adjective 
phrases (see 2.100). Adverbs of manner based on numbers are 
described in sections 1.159–60 and 1.163.
Afﬁ xation se-…-nya with reduplicated bases
With reduplicated adjective bases this afﬁ xation derives adverbs 
meaning ‘as [base] as possible’:
baik good 
sebaik-baiknya as well as 
possible
cepat fast 
secepat-cepatnya as fast as 
possible
keras hard 
sekeras-kerasnya as hard as 
possible
lekas soon, quickly 
selekas-lekasnya as soon/
quickly as possible
tinggi high 
setinggi-tingginya as high as 
possible
Dia lari secepat-cepatnya.
She ran as fast as possible.
Dia harus dihukum seberat-beratnya.
He must be punished as severely as possible.
These adverbs are further discussed in sections 2.173–4.
A few words of this structure mean ‘at the most [base]’; bases 
are adjectives or modifying adverbs (see 2.100–1):
dikit, sedikit a little 
sedikit-dikitnya at least
kurang less 
sekurang-kurangnya at least, at 
 
  the least
lambat late 
selambat-lambatnya at the 
 
  latest

I must leave for Indonesia by the 25th of July at the latest.
 Anda harus menunggu sekurang-kurangnya sepuluh menit.
You must wait at least ten minutes.
These forms can occasionally occur without reduplication:
Sedikitnya dua puluh orang tewas.
At least twenty people died.
Dia sadar sepenuhnya bahwa saya benar.
He’s fully aware that I am correct.
A few forms are based on words of other classes:
setidak-tidaknya at least
 sedapat-dapatnya as well as possible, as much as one is
  capable of
 Kalau tidak bisa datang sendiri, setidak-tidaknya 
menelpon.
If you can’t come yourself, at least phone.
Saya akan berusaha sedapat-dapatnya.
I will try as well as I can/to the best of my ability.
A few forms, based on adjectives or other classes, have meanings 
such as ‘as one likes’. Most of these occur without reduplication 
of the base:
seenak-enaknya, seenaknya as one likes
semau-maunya, semaunya as one likes
seadanya as it is, as one ﬁ nds it
sekenanya at random, in disorganised fashion
Mereka parkir seenaknya.
They park just as they please.
A number of forms, such as sebenarnya ‘actually’ and sehar-
usnya ‘should’, are sentence adjuncts. These are discussed in 
sections 4.106–7. Several forms, including setibanya ‘on his 
arrival’ and sepulangnya ‘on his return home’, function as 
subordinate clauses of time, discussed in section 4.71.

Sufﬁ x -an with reduplicated bases
A few adverbs of manner are formed by adding -an to redupli-
cated adjective, verb and noun bases:
angin-anginan capriciously, in ﬁ ts and starts
besar-besaran on a large scale
habis-habisan exhaustively, vehemently
kecil-kecilan on a small scale
mati-matian with great effort
terang-terangan frankly, openly
terus-terusan constantly, on and on
untung-untungan relying on luck
Ibu memarahi saya habis-habisan.
Mother scolded me vehemently.
Circumﬁ x se-…-an with reduplicated bases
This occurs with two reduplicated bases to form adjuncts of 
duration (see 2.204):
sehari-harian all day long
semalam-malaman all night long
Preﬁ x ber- with reduplicated bases
Nouns indicating periods of time and distance can be redupli-
cated and preﬁ xed with ber- to form adjuncts of duration and 
length (see also 1.162 and 2.203):
berjam-jam for hours
berminggu-minggu for weeks
bertahun-tahun for years
bermeter-meter (for) metres (and metres)
berkilo-kilo (for) kilometres
Derivation of numbers
As well as occurring in noun phrases (see 2.13ff), some numbers 
can occur as adverbs of manner (see 2.177). All derived forms 
based on numbers are described in the following sections.

It occurs with group numbers (see 2.107) to form cardinals:
sepuluh ten  
sebelas eleven
seratus one hundred  
seribu one thousand
sejuta a million
se- also forms fractions, often in combination with per- (see 
1.149):
seperempat one-quarter
seperlima one-ﬁ fth
setengah one half
separuh one half
While seperdua ‘half’ is possible, setengah and separuh are 
commonly used.
Preﬁ x per-
This forms fractions, being preﬁ xed to the denominator and 
preceded by the numerator:
sepertiga one-third
tiga perlima three-ﬁ fths
tujuh persepuluh seven-tenths
sembilan perseratus nine-hundredths
In the sporting term perempat ﬁ nal ‘quarter ﬁ nal’, per- is not 
preceded by a number:
Dia maju ke perempat ﬁ nal.
He advanced to the quarter-ﬁ nal.
Preﬁ x ke-
This is added to cardinal numbers to form ordinals (see 
2.16):
kedua second  
ketiga third
kesepuluh tenth  
kedua puluh tiga twenty-third
For ‘ﬁ rst’, the form kesatu occurs but pertama is much more 
common.

Ordinals are sometimes written with Roman numerals, in 
which case ke- is not shown:
HUT XIX (= hari ulang tahun kesembilan belas)
nineteenth anniversary
Preﬁ x ke- also forms the interrogative ordinal keberapa ‘how 
many’ (see 4.20) and the indeﬁ nite ordinal kesekian ‘umpteenth’ 
(see 2.198).
Forms derived with ke- are also used for collective numbers 
(see 2.17):
keempat all four 
kelima all ﬁ ve
Ketiga anak itu sangat nakal.
Those three kids are very naughty.
Sufﬁ x -an
This sufﬁ x occurs with group numbers (see 2.107) with several 
meanings.
With group numbers, but not with their multiples, -an indicates 
an indeﬁ nite multiple of the group number:
puluhan tens
ribuan thousands
puluhan ribu mobil tens of thousands of cars
Belasan indicates an indeﬁ nite number between ten and twenty:
belasan hari between ten and twenty days, about two weeks
 belasan tahun many years (more than ten but less than 
twenty years)
With multiples of group numbers it indicates an estimate, ‘about 
so many, that number or so’:
delapan puluhan about eighty, eighty odd
dua ratusan about two hundred
 Rumah mereka ditembaki oleh lima puluhan pasukan tak 
dikenal.
 Their houses were ﬁ red on by about ﬁ fty unidentiﬁ ed soldiers.

With dates which are multiples of puluh the form refers to a 
particular decade:

Ia anggota politbiro PKI pada awal 1920-an.
He was a member of the PKI politbureau in the early 1920s.
Preﬁ x ber-
Attached to cardinal numbers from ‘two’ to ‘four’ this derives 
numbers referring to a group:
berdua both, two together
bertiga all three, three together
berempat all four, four together
These forms occur with pronouns (see 2.79 for examples) but 
not with nouns.
These forms also function as adverbs of manner meaning 
‘together in a group of [base]’:
Mereka selalu bersepeda berdua.
They always cycle together (in a group of two).
Mereka makan sepiring nasi berempat.
They ate a plate of rice together in a group of four.
With reduplicated numbers from ‘two’ to ‘four’ ber- forms 
adverbs indicating ‘(acting) in a number of groups of [base] at 
a time’:
berdua-dua two at a time, two by two
bertiga-tiga three at a time, three by three
berempat-empat four at a time, four by four
Mereka masuk berdua-dua.
They entered two by two.
Preﬁ x ber- can be omitted from these forms (see 1.25).
Attached to reduplicated group numbers, ber- forms indeﬁ nite 
multiples of the base:
berpuluh-puluh tens

With reduplicated nouns referring to containers, weights and 
measures, ber- forms quantiﬁ ers meaning ‘in numbers of [base]’ 
(see 2.33), similar in function to forms based on numbers (see 1.161) 
and on periods of time or length measurements (see 1.144):
berbotol-botol bottles and bottlesful
berkarung-karung sacksful
berkeranjang-keranjang basketsful
berkilo-kilo kilos and kilos
bermeter-meter metres and metres
bertimbun-timbun piles and piles
berton-ton tons and tons
Bangunan ini menghabiskan berton-ton batu bata.
This building used up tons and tons of bricks.
Polisi menyita berbotol-botol minuman keras.
Police conﬁ scated bottles and bottles of alcohol.
Circumﬁ x ber-…-an
This occurs with the numeral dua ‘two’, with optional reduplica-
tion, to form an adverb meaning ‘together’, of action performed 
by two people:
Dia duduk berdua(-dua)an dengan pacarnya.
He sat together with his girlfriend.
Derivation of verbs
For ease and clarity of description, two groups of verbs are 
recognised here: primary and secondary verbs. Primary verbs 
are those which occur with primary afﬁ xation, as described in 
sections 1.165–1.245. Secondary verbs are those which have 
secondary afﬁ xation, which replaces primary afﬁ xation under 
certain circumstances. Secondary verbs are described in sections 
1.246–85.

 Afﬁ xes 65
Every verb is either transitive or intransitive. Transitive verbs 
can have an object and a passive form; intransitive verbs have 
neither. Transitivity is discussed in sections 3.18–25.
Verbs are based on nouns, adjectives and other classes. A base 
which cannot occur alone as a word is a verbal base. Thus atur 
cannot occur alone but is the base for verbs such as mengatur 
‘organise’; it is therefore a verbal base.
Primary verbs
Primary verbs are either intransitive or transitive. Intransitive 
primary verbs are simple; that is, they have no afﬁ x, or have 
preﬁ x ber- or meN-. All transitive primary verbs occur with one 
of the inﬂ ectional voice afﬁ xes, meN- or di-. Transitive verbs are 
either simple, having no afﬁ x other than meN- or di-, or they 
occur with one of the following afﬁ xes or afﬁ x combi nations: 
-kan, -i, per-, per-…-kan, per-…-i.
Simple intransitive verbs
A simple intransitive verb occurs alone without an afﬁ x. There 
are a great many of these, of which the following are a small 
sample:
bangun wake up 
benci hate
cinta love 
datang come
duduk sit 
gagal fail
hidup live 
ikut follow
ingat remember 
jatuh fall
kembali return 
lenyap disappear
lulus pass 
lupa forget
mandi bathe 
masuk enter
mati die 
menang win
mulai begin 
percaya believe
pergi go 
pindah move
selesai ﬁ nish 
tahu know
tenggelam sink, drown 
terbang ﬂ y
tiba arrive 
tidur sleep
Intransitive verbs with ber-
Some ber- verbs have verbal bases. It is difﬁ cult to assign a 
meaning to ber- with such bases other than that its presence is 
1.165
1.166
1.167

necessary to produce a well-formed verb. Some of these verbs 
take a complement (see 3.63–4):
berangkat leave 
berenang swim
berbaring lie 
belajar study
berbuat do 
berhenti stop
bekerja work 
berdiri stand
bertemu meet 
berubah change
berpikir think 
bertiup blow
bercukur shave 
berputar turn
A few ber- verbs which refer to reﬂ exive action optionally take 
diri ‘self’ in a compound form:
berdiam (diri) be silent
berjemur (diri) sunbake, go out in the sun
berhias (diri) dress, groom oneself
In this construction diri cannot be expanded as it can when it 
is a separate phrase (see 2.162ff).
The largest group of ber- verbs have noun bases. With these it is 
possible to assign a function to ber-. There is considerable vari-
ation in the categories recognised by different writers, and the 
function of the preﬁ x with some noun bases is open to differ-
ent interpretations. However, there is little purpose in striving to 
identify a large number of categories, each with a small number 
of members and a very narrow semantic range. The groupings 
suggested here could all be subdivided into smaller groups.
The largest group has a general meaning: ‘have, own [base]’. 
Some of these verbs do not translate well as ‘have [base]’, such as 
berdebu ‘dusty’ (literally: ‘have dust’), or berguna ‘useful’ (‘have 
use’); in such cases, the appropriate gloss is provided. Some of 
these verbs take a complement (see 3.64). This group includes:
berguna useful 
beristeri have a wife
berisi contain 
berbau smell
berduri thorny 
berdebu dusty
berumur be aged 
beranak have children
bermaksud mean 
berhasil succeed
bernama be named 
berpendapat have the opinion
1.168
1.169
1.170

 Afﬁ xes 67
Some verbs mean ‘to use, wear, travel by [base]’. To this group 
can be added forms based on pronouns meaning ‘use [base] 
when speaking to someone’:
bertopi wear a hat 
berbedak wear powder
berdasi wear a tie 
berkuda ride a horse
berjas wear a suit jacket 
berperahu go by boat
bersepatu wear shoes 
bersepeda ride a bicycle
berbapak use bapak ‘father’ when addressing someone
beraku use aku ‘I’ when speaking to someone
Another subgroup of ber- verbs mean ‘produce [base]’. Many 
of these refer to production of the sound indicated by the 
base:
berkeringat sweat 
berbohong lie
bertelur lay an egg 
berdesing whizz, buzz
beranak give birth 
berkokok crow
berbuah bear fruit 
berderit squeak
berteriak scream 
berbunyi make a sound
berkata say 
bercerita relate, tell a story
With noun bases denoting a reciprocal relationship, ber- verbs 
indicate that two people stand in such relationship to each 
other. Thus bertetangga ‘be neighbours’, as in Ali dan Tomo 
bertetangga ‘Ali and Tomo are neighbours (with each other)’:
berteman be friends
bermusuh be enemies
bersahabat be friends
berkenalan be acquaintances
berkerabat be related
bertunangan be engaged to each other
bersaudara be relatives of the same generation
bersaingan be competitors, compete (with each other)
The verbs berkenalan, bertunangan, bersaingan and similar 
forms having sufﬁ x -an are regarded here as being built on bases 
kenalan ‘acquaintance’, tunangan ‘ﬁ ancé’, saingan ‘competitor’ 
and so on. They could alternatively be treated as ber-…-an 
reciprocal verbs (see 1.255ff) built on verbal bases such as kenal, 
tunang and saing.

Some ber- verbs refer to work which is regularly performed or 
done for a living. In this group are included some verbs with 
verbal bases:
berdagang engage in trade
berkebun own or work gardens
berkuli work as a labourer
berladang own or work unirrigated ﬁ elds
bersawah own or work rice ﬁ elds
bertani farm
bertukang work as an artisan
beternak engage in animal farming
Some verbs in this group optionally have a complement (see 
3.64). These differ from transitive verbs with an object in that 
they specify habitual action rather than an action performed on 
a particular object:
berburu (rusa) engage in (deer) hunting
bertanam (jagung) plant (corn) (as an occupation)
Similar to verbs listed in section 1.174 are those which mean 
‘engage in the activity speciﬁ ed by the base’; many of these are 
based on nouns referring to types of sport:
berolah raga play sport
bertinju box
bergulat wrestle
berpiknik go on a picnic
berperang wage war
berbelanja go shopping
bertamasya go sightseeing
berdarmawisata go on an excursion
Many ber- verbs have noun bases which are phrases. Although 
these are written as separate words, they act as a single unit to 
which ber- is attached. As free forms the bases are noun phrases 
consisting usually of a noun and noun (see 2.37) or noun and 
adjective (see 2.45). Thus the phrase celana pendek ‘short 
pants’ becomes the base of the verb bercelana pendek ‘wear 
short pants’. Other compounds consist of a noun plus number. 
In a free phrase the number precedes the noun (see 2.14); it is 
1.174
1.175
1.176

 Afﬁ xes 69
placed after the noun when the phrase becomes a verbal base. 
Thus dua anak ‘two children’ forms the base of beranak dua 
‘have two children’:
berbaju kulit wear a leather coat
berkaki panjang have long legs
berkebun kelapa have a coconut plantation
berkepala gundul have a shaved head
berpendidikan rendah be poorly educated
bertubuh kurus be thin (have a thin body)
bertingkat tiga have three storeys, three-storey
Such phrasal verb bases should not be confused with verbs 
followed by a complement. In the sentence Dia bernama Ali 
‘He is named Ali’, the verb bernama ‘have the name’ is followed 
by a complement, Ali. The words nama ‘name’ and Ali do not 
form a phrase but rather a clause, Nama(nya) Ali ‘His name is 
Ali’. Such complements are described in section 3.64.
A few ber- verbs have adjective bases:
bergembira be glad 
berbahagia be happy
berterus-terang be frank 
bersedih be sad
berkeras persist 
bersabar be patient
Preﬁ x ber- combined with preﬁ x si-
The combination bersi- occurs with a few verbs. In all cases, 
si- is optional:
bersikeras, berkeras persist
bersitegang, bertegang persevere
bersikukuh, berkukuh be stubborn, persist
bersijingkat, berjingkat walk on tiptoes
Intransitive verbs with meN-
Some intransitive verbs with preﬁ x meN- have verbal bases. 
MeN- cannot be assigned a function with these verbs, other 
than that its presence is required to produce a well-formed verb. 
Verbs in this group include:
menangis cry 
mendidih boil
menyerah surrender 
mengungsi ﬂ ee
melapor report 
meledak explode

menyanyi sing 
menyuruk hide, duck
mengeluh complain 
menelentang lie on the back
meluncur slide 
menginap spend the night
menikah marry 
melompat jump
Many meN- intransitive verbs have noun bases. As with ber- 
verbs based on nouns, a number of different meanings can be 
identiﬁ ed.
Some verbs mean ‘go to [base]’, where the base refers to a 
location:
mendarat land 
menepi move to the side
melaut go to sea 
mengutara go north
menyeberang cross to the 
  other side
Others mean ‘produce [base]’, where the base is a sound:
mengeong meouw 
meraung roar
menjerit scream 
mendengkur snore
menggonggong bark 
mengeluh groan
mengerang groan 
memekik scream
Some meN- verbs with noun bases mean ‘become like, resemble 
[base]’:
memuncak reach a crest, culminate
menggunung pile up, mount up
membatu petrify, harden
membukit form a heap, resemble a hill
membabi buta rage blindly
With adjective bases meN- usually forms verbs meaning ‘become 
[base], take on the characteristic of [base]’:
menghebat intensify 
membengkak swell
menghangat warm up 
menguning grow yellow
mereda calm down, abate 
membusuk rot, decay
mengering dry 
memutih become white
menyempit tighten,

 Afﬁ xes 71
Preﬁ x meN- cannot be added to all adjectives with this meaning. 
The number of such forms is limited and unpredictable, 
although there is some degree of productivity.7
The verb memanjang (panjang ‘long’) means ‘stretch’, as in 
Pantai itu memanjang dari barat ke timur ‘The beach stretches 
from west to east’.
Comparison of simple, ber- and meN- intransitive verbs
Verb bases occur with ber-, and meN- or without afﬁ xation 
unpredictably. For instance, there is no explanation for the 
following forms other than usage: mandi ‘bathe’, berbaring ‘lie 
down’, menginap ‘stay’. With such forms ber- and meN- can 
be ascribed no function other than that they are required with 
particular bases.
If the base is other than a verb, either ber- or meN- must 
occur to derive a verb. Here also there is sometimes no predict-
ability about which afﬁ x will occur. Thus: berteriak ‘yell, shout’, 
memekik ‘scream’.
With a number of bases ber- and meN- can substitute for 
each other, although usually one form is more common than 
the other. A number of these forms mean ‘produce the sound 
indicated by the base’. Others have verb bases:
bernyanyi, menyanyi sing
berderit, menderit scream
berteduh, meneduh take shelter
berdengkur, mendengkur snore
berbekas, membekas leave a trace or mark
berdoa, mendoa pray
bersebar, menyebar spread out
berludah, meludah spit
In a few other cases, two forms occur but with a clear difference 
in meaning:
tinggal live 
meninggal die
pulang go home 
berpulang die
lari run, ﬂ ee, escape 
berlari run

Transitive verb afﬁ xation
Transitive verbs are inﬂ ected for voice; meN- marks active voice, 
di- marks passive voice. Voice is discussed in 3.26–40. Under 
some circumstances these afﬁ xes are omitted; for instance, meN- 
in certain imperative constructions, di- with ﬁ rst and second 
person agent. These processes are described in the appropriate 
places.
In addition, meN- is usually omitted with a few common 
verbs: makan ‘eat’, minum ‘drink’, minta ‘request’, mohon 
‘request’, although afﬁ xed forms of these, memakan etc., do 
occur. Without the preﬁ x, these behave differently from other 
transitive verbs in some ways; for instance, they cannot take 
bound objects, such as -nya (see 2.71).
The verb mengerti ‘understand’ is unusual in that the 
preﬁ x does not drop in the passive (see 3.27); thus dimengerti 
‘understood’. Some grammarians account for this by treating 
mengerti as not having a preﬁ x, meng- being part of the base. 
However, the verb was originally based on arti ‘meaning’ and 
meng- is not retained in the presence of circumﬁ x peN-…-an; 
thus pengertian ‘understanding’. It must therefore be regarded 
as a preﬁ x.
In colloquial usage meN- may frequently be dropped, 
although consideration of this lies outside the scope of this 
work. It is just noted here that the tendency for meN- to be 
dropped increases as the degree of informality of the speech 
situation increases.8
Apart from the above contexts, meN- is predictably present 
on active transitive verbs and is consequently omitted from illus-
trative examples in some grammar works. However, because its 
occurrence is required in most natural contexts it is retained in 
examples here. That is, the examples are given in the active voice 
form of the verb.
Simple transitive verbs
Most simple transitive verbs have verb bases. They have no 
afﬁ xes other than one of the voice afﬁ xes meN- if active and di- 
if passive. There are a great many such verbs and the following 
list is far from exhaustive:

mengangkat lift
menolong help 
merasa feel

Some simple transitive verbs are based on nouns and mean ‘use 
[base] on the object, apply [base] to the object’. Some of these 
can occur without the object being expressed, as described in 
section 3.21.
menyapu sweep
memotret photograph
memborgol handcuff

menggergaji saw
mencat, mengecat paint

menggunting cut (with scissors)
mengebor bore, drill
Transitive verbs with sufﬁ x -kan
All verbs with sufﬁ x -kan are transitive with the exception of 
merupakan (see 3.25). A number of different functions of -kan 
can be identiﬁ ed, although it is also possible to regard it as having 
two basic functions, that of marking the object as patient and 
that of marking the object as beneﬁ ciary. The different roles of 
participants in the action, such as patient and beneﬁ ciary, are 
discussed in section 3.17.
With non-benefactive verbs -kan usually marks the object as 
the patient of the action; that is, the thing which is manipulated, 
acted on or moved by the action. However, with some verbs this 
participant can also be regarded as the instrument (see 1.205).

With many verb bases -kan has no other function than identify-
ing the object as the patient of the action. Like ber- and meN-, 
with intransitive verb bases it is simply required to produce a 
well-formed verb. Verbs in this group include:
melemparkan throw 
meninggalkan leave
mengerjakan do, work 
menguraikan analyse
merundingkan discuss 
memikirkan think about
menyebutkan mention 
melakukan do, carry out
membutuhkan need 
melaksanakan carry out
menerangkan explain 
menghamburkan scatter
menerapkan apply 
mengharapkan hope
membicarakan discuss 
mengenakan put on
menyiarkan broadcast 
menerjemahkan translate
menghiraukan pay 
menyumbangkan contribute
  attention to
mengadakan do, carry out membandingkan compare
menganjurkan urge, suggest
With some bases, including some listed above, -kan is optional, 
as discussed in section 1.210. With some verbs -kan can be 
replaced by sufﬁ x -i; in this case, the object is the recipient or 
location rather than the patient (see 1.212).
Causative -kan
With many verbs -kan has a causative function. The base may 
be an adjective, noun or verb.
If the base is an adjective, the object is caused to have the quality 
or characteristic speciﬁ ed by the base. Thus member sihkan 
means ‘cause object to be clean (bersih)’:
Kamar ini sudah bersih.
This room is clean.
Siti sudah membersihkan kamar ini.
Siti has cleaned this room.
This form is very productive and can be based on most adjectives:
mengamankan pacify, render safe (aman peaceful, safe)
membersihkan clean (bersih clean)
melebarkan widen (lebar wide)

 Afﬁ xes 75
mengeringkan dry (kering dry)
membebaskan set free, release (bebas free)
mematikan extinguish (mati dead)
melembutkan soften (lembut soft)
With a few verbs the meaning is not predictable from the 
meaning of the adjective base:
 membenarkan correct; conﬁ rm; approve (benar right, correct)
memberatkan make things difﬁ cult for (berat heavy)
mengindahkan pay attention to (indah beautiful; precious)
menyulitkan cause difﬁ culty for (sulit difﬁ cult)
menggelapkan embezzle (gelap dark)
 meremehkan belittle; underestimate (remeh of no importance)
memuliakan honour deeply (mulia noble)
One subtype of causatives are based on adjectives indicat-
ing emotions and attitudes. These verbs indicate that the 
subject causes the object to experience the emotion or 
attitude expressed by the base. Such verbs can function as 
ordinary transitives when the action applies to a particular 
object:
Film-ﬁ lm seperti itu membosankan saya.
Movies like that bore me.
Pidatonya mengecewakan para pemilih.
His speech disappointed the voters.
Laporan itu mengejutkan banyak orang.
The report startled many people.
However, when the object is understood as applying to everyone 
in general, it is typically omitted:
Film itu membosankan.
That movie is boring.
Pidatonya mengecewakan.
His speech was disappointing.
Laporan itu mengejutkan.
The report is startling.
When there is no object these verbs function like adjectives and 
are usually translated by adjectives, as in the above examples.

Like adjectives they can take modifying adverbs, such as kian 
‘increasingly’ and sangat ‘very’ (see 2.100):
Kondisinya kian memprihatinkan.
His condition is causing increasing concern.
Kabar itu sangat menyedihkan.
The news was very saddening.
Other verbs in this group include the following. Typical trans-
lations with and without an object are given:
memuaskan satisfy/satisfying
memalukan embarrass/embarrassing
mengejutkan startle/startling
menyenangkan please/pleasing
meyakinkan convince/convincing
menakutkan frighten/frightening

With these verbs a phrase beginning with untuk or bagi (see 
2.105) may occur instead of an object. In this case, the verb 
behaves like an adjective and is translated as such:
Kelakuannya memalukan ibunya.
His behaviour embarrassed his mother.
Kelakuannya memalukan bagi ibunya.
His behaviour was embarrassing for his mother.
The verb mengherankan ‘amazing’ frequently occurs with 
tidak, meaning ‘no wonder, it’s not surprising’:
 Tidak mengherankan perusahaan itu terus berkembang 
dengan pesatnya.
It’s not surprising that company continues to grow quickly.
A number of other verbs, including some with noun bases, 
function in the same way as the emotive verbs and can be 
grouped with them, such as:
 merugikan inﬂ ict a loss on, damage/damaging, harmful 
(rugi suffer a loss)
 menghebohkan cause a sensation, cause an uproar/
sen sational (heboh commotion, uproar)
1.195

mengesankan impress/impressive (kesan impression)
 merepotkan cause difﬁ culty for/causing difﬁ culty, being a 
nuisance (repot busy, going to trouble)
Keputusan itu sangat merepotkan.
The decision caused a great deal of difﬁ culty.
Some of the verbs in this group can also indicate that the 
subject experiences the emotion expressed by the base. Thus, as 
well as meaning ‘cause apprehension’, mencemaskan can 
mean ‘feel apprehension’. As well as meaning ‘cause to be 
proud’, membanggakan can mean ‘be proud of’, and meng-
khawatirkan can mean ‘worry about’ as well as meaning ‘cause 
worry’:
Banyak pengamat mencemaskan bahwa Kim akan gagal.
Many observers are apprehensive that Kim will fail.
Pak Hasrun membanggakan anaknya.
Mr Hasrun is proud of his son.
 Terus terang, kami mengkhawatirkan munculnya mono-
poli baru.
 Frankly, we are worried about the appearance of new 
monopolies.
This function is not frequent with active verbs, although it is 
increasing in journalistic style. However, it occurs regularly if 
the verb is passive (see 3.26); that is, the agent experiences the 
emotion indicated by the base rather than causing someone else 
to experience it:
Mereka tak perlu kausedihkan. (cf. menyedihkan sadden)
There’s no need for you to feel sorry for them.
Itu yang saya takutkan. (cf. menakutkan frighten)
That’s what I’m afraid of.
 Anaknya selalu dirisaukannya. (cf. merisaukan cause 
(object) to worry; worry about)
She’s always worried about her child.
When the base of a -kan verb is an intransitive verb, the meaning is 
usually ‘cause the object to perform [base]’. Thus membangunkan 
‘wake (someone) up’ and mendaratkan ‘land (something)’ 
1.197

are based on the intransitive verbs bangun ‘wake up’ and mendarat 
‘land’ respectively:
Siti bangun.
Siti woke up.
Ibu membangunkan Siti.
Mother woke Siti up.
Pesawat sudah mendarat.
The plane has landed.
Pilot sudah mendaratkan pesawat.
The pilot has landed the plane.
Other verbs in this group include the following (the cor res-
ponding intransitive verb is indicated in parentheses):
menjatuhkan drop (jatuh fall)
 mengembalikan return, take/bring back (kembali return, 
go back)
menaikkan raise (naik go up)
melahirkan give birth to (lahir be born)
mendirikan establish, set up (berdiri stand)
mengumpulkan collect (berkumpul collect, 
  gather)
menghentikan stop (berhenti stop)
menyatukan unite (bersatu united)
 menyingkirkan remove, eliminate (menyingkir 
  step aside)
mendekatkan bring nearer (mendekat approach)
menyurukkan hide, duck (menyuruk hide, duck)
In three words the preﬁ x ber- of the corresponding intransi-
tive verb is retained when meN- is added. In two cases, the base 
without ber- also occurs, the verbs having different meanings 
with and without ber-. All the transitive verbs except melaku-
kan have causative meaning:
 memberhentikan dismiss, sack (berhenti stop); 
  menghentikan stop
memberangkatkan dispatch (berangkat depart)
 memberlakukan apply, put into effect (rules) (berlaku 
apply, be in effect); melakukan do, perform
1.199

 Afﬁ xes 79
In one word the preﬁ x meN- of the corresponding intransitive 
verb is retained, there also being a form derived directly from 
the adjective base:
 memeratakan distribute evenly (merata become even); 
meratakan make level, smooth (rata level, smooth, even)
Causative verbs can be based on simple transitive verbs. These 
indicate that the subject causes another person to carry out 
the action on the object. The one who carries out the action is 
expressed by a prepositional phrase beginning with ke(pada) 
or pada.
Causative verbs in this group usually have no direct trans-
lation into English. Their translation requires a circumlocu-
tion of the type ‘have something done by someone’, with a 
passive verb. Thus memeriksakan is translated ‘have the object 
inspected/checked by someone’ and mencucikan is translated 
‘have the object washed by someone’:
Dokter memeriksa mata saya.
The doctor checked my eyes.
Saya memeriksakan mata ke dokter.
I had my eyes checked by the doctor.
Wanita itu mencuci pakaian saya.
That woman washes my clothes.
Saya mencucikan pakaian pada wanita itu.
I have my clothes washed by that woman.
Occasionally, such verbs do have a direct translation in English, 
as with meminjamkan ‘lend’ (i.e. cause someone to borrow), 
which is based on meminjam to borrow:
Ali meminjam buku saya.
Ali borrowed my book.
Saya meminjamkan buku saya kepada Ali.
I lent my book to Ali.
With a number of verbs in this group a location is more likely 
to be expressed than an actor; in either case, the preposition can 
be pada:
Di mana kau mencucikan pakaianmu?
Where do you have your clothes washed?

baru itu.
 I want to get my calling cards printed at that new printery. 
(mencetak print)
With some verbs an acceptable English translation is possible 
without a passive, even if there is no special equivalent to the 
-kan verb. In the following examples, membebankan ‘cause 
(object) to be borne’ and menontonkan ‘cause (object) to be 
viewed’ can be translated ‘impose a burden’ and ‘display, exhibit’ 
respectively:
Polisi memikul beban ganti rugi.
The police bore the burden of compensation.
Hakim memikulkan beban ganti rugi pada polisi.
 The judge imposed the burden of compensation on the 
police.
Pengunjung menonton hasil kemajuan yang terakhir.
The visitors viewed the results of the latest progress.
Mereka menontonkan hasil kemajuan yang terakhir.
They display the results of the latest progress.
Other verbs in this group include the following (a gloss with a 
passive verb is provided where this is the most natural trans-
lation):
 meminumkan cause (object) to be drunk, give (object) to 
be drunk
menyewakan rent out, lease out
menjahitkan have (object) sewn
menggilingkan have (object) milled
mengoperasikan have (object) operated on
menimbangkan have (object) weighed
menambalkan have (object) patched
memuatkan load, cause (truck) to hold (memuat) a load
menyunatkan have (son) circumcised

Many -kan verbs are based on nouns. There are several func-
tions, of which only the commonest are listed in the following 
sections.
Some verbs mean ‘put the object in [base], or take the object to 
[base]’, where the base is a location. Thus memakamkan ‘bury’ 
means ‘cause the object to be put in a makam (grave)’. Other 
examples:
memasarkan (take to) market (pasar market)
 mengandangkan put in a stable/pen (kandang animal 
enclosure)
mementaskan stage (a play) (pentas stage)
meliburkan send on holiday (libur leave, holiday)
meminggirkan put to the edge (pinggir edge)
menggudangkan store, put in a store (gudang warehouse)
memenjarakan put in jail (penjara jail)
menyekolahkan send to school (sekolah school)
A number of verbs in this group have as their base directional 
ke ‘to’ and usually a locative noun, the most frequent being 
mengemukakan ‘state, present, put forward’, based on ke muka 
‘to the front’:
 Dia sudah mengemukakan pendapatnya mengenai 
pembredelan majalah itu.
 He has presented his opinion on the banning of the 
magazine.
Others verbs in this group are:
 mengetengahkan produce (evidence); set forth (ke tengah 
to the centre)
 mengesampingkan put aside, ignore (ke samping to the 
side)
mengebumikan bury (ke bumi into the earth)
mengeluarkan put/take outside (ke luar to the outside)
The passive form of these verbs maintains ke:
Telah dikeluarkan terlalu banyak uang untuk proyek itu.
Too much money has been spent on that project.
1.201
1.202

82 Words
Many -kan verbs with noun bases mean ‘cause the object to be 
[base], treat the object as [base], give the object as [base]’. Thus 
mengorbankan means ‘cause (object) to be a korban (sacriﬁ ce)’, 
mencalonkan means ‘cause (object) to be a calon (candidate)’, 
menghadiahkan means ‘give (object) as a hadiah (present)’:
Orang Toraja mengorbankan banyak kerbau.
The Torajans sacriﬁ ced many buffaloes.
Dia mencalonkan adiknya.
He nominated his younger brother.
 Gubernur menghadiahkan sebidang tanah kepada guru 
teladan.
 The governor gave a plot of land (as a gift) to the model 
teacher.
Other verbs in this group include:
menceritakan tell, narrate (cerita story)
menasihatkan advise (nasihat advice)
menargetkan target, aim at (target target)
merencanakan plan (rencana plan)
mengabarkan report (kabar news)
 mengambinghitamkan make (object) a scapegoat (kambing 
hitam scapegoat)
menjanjikan promise (janji promise)
 mendewakan idolise, treat (object) as a god (dewa god, 
deity)
menyukseskan make (object) a success (sukses success)
mengeramatkan consider (object) sacred (keramat sacred)
merahasiakan keep (object) a secret (rahasia secret)
 mewakilkan appoint (object) as representative, delegate 
(wakil representative)
A number of other categories with small numbers of members 
can be identiﬁ ed but many -kan verbs with noun bases have 
unpredictable meanings or can only be categorised unconvinc-
ingly. Only the following loose grouping is noted in addition to 
the groups listed above.
A few verbs indicate that the subject acts as/is [base] with 
respect to the object, gives [base] to the object, or directs [base] 
at the object. Thus membahayakan ‘be a danger (bahaya) to’:
1.203
1.204

 Afﬁ xes 83
Letusan gunung itu membahayakan daerah sekitarnya.
 The eruption of the volcano endangered (was a danger to) 
the surrounding region.
Some other members of this group are:
mencerminkan reﬂ ect (cermin mirror)
melambangkan symbolise (lambang symbol)
menyaksikan witness (saksi witness)
membuktikan prove (bukti proof)
mengecohkan deceive (kecoh fraud, deceit)
‘Instrumental’ -kan
With one group of verbs -kan is usually interpreted as 
marking the object as instrument. These verbs are based on 
simple transitive verbs with a change in structure such that 
the object of the simple verb becomes the location with the 
-kan verb and the instrument of the simple verb becomes 
the object with the -kan verb. This is shown by the following 
examples:
Dia memukul anjing dengan tongkat.
He hit the dog with a stick.
Dia memukulkan tongkat pada anjing.
He used the stick to beat the dog with.
Dia menikam perut harimau dengan belati.
He stabbed the tiger’s belly with a knife.
Dia menikamkan belati ke perut harimau.
He thrust the knife into the tiger’s belly.
As the above examples show, there is frequently no direct 
trans lation into English of -kan instrumental forms. Thus 
menikamkan belati is translated ‘thrust the knife’, whereas 
it literally means ‘stab with a knife’. Sometimes, however, a 
more literal translation is natural in English. Thus ‘wrap’ can 
translate both the non-instrumental and the instrumental 
verbs in the following:
Perawat membalut lukanya dengan kain.
The nurse wrapped his wound with a bandage.
Perawat membalutkan kain ke lukanya.
The nurse wrapped the cloth around his wound.
1.205

Other examples:
 Dia menyentuhkan gelas pada bibir temannya. (cf. meny-
entuh bibirnya touch his lips)
He touched the glass to his friend’s lips.
 Aku memelukkan tangan pada pinggangnya. (cf. memeluk 
pinggangnya embrace her waist)
I wrapped my arms around her waist.
Other verbs in this class, with typical instrumental objects 
shown in parentheses, include:
memotongkan (parang) chop with (a machete)
mencukurkan (pisau) shave with (a knife)
mengetokkan (palu) knock with (a hammer)
menembakkan (pistol) shoot with (a pistol)
mencambukkan (tali) whip with (a rope)
menutupkan (kain) cover with (a cloth)
menggoreskan (pena) scratch with (pens)
mencengkamkan (kuku) grasp with (talons)
Although these verbs are usually regarded as marking the object 
as being the instrument with which the action is performed, 
the object cannot always be so regarded, as shown by the 
following:
Dia memukulkan kepala ke dinding.
He beat his head against the wall.
Dia menggoreskan kukunya ke meja.
She scratched her nail on the table.
These examples show that what is basically important in these 
constructions is that the object is something which is handled, 
manipulated or moved (the patient—see 3.17); with the corre-
sponding simple verbs the object is something at which the 
action is directed.9
Benefactive -kan
With a number of verbs -kan functions to indicate that the 
object is the beneﬁ ciary, the person for whose beneﬁ t the action 
is performed. This is sometimes called ‘benefactive -kan’.
1.206

 Afﬁ xes 85
All verbs which can take benefactive -kan also occur as 
simple transitive verbs with an object which indicates the 
patient. In the benefactive construction there are two objects. 
The one immediately following the verb is the primary object, 
which identiﬁ es the beneﬁ ciary; the second is the second-
ary object, which indicates the patient (see 3.20 for further 
discussion of primary and secondary objects). The examples 
below illustrate simple transitive verbs and their benefactive 
counterparts:
Pelayan mengambil segelas air.
The waiter fetched a glass of water.
Pelayan mengambilkan tamu segelas air.
The waiter fetched the guest a glass of water.
Dia menjahit rok.
She sewed a skirt.
Dia menjahitkan anaknya rok.
She sewed her child a skirt.
A number of benefactive verbs, such as those in the above 
examples, have English equivalents which also allow the 
ben eﬁ ciary to be expressed as the object. Some others are:
membuatkan make (for)
membelikan buy (for)
memilihkan choose (for)
memasakkan cook (for)
memesankan order (for)
For a number of other benefactive verbs the corresponding 
English verb does not allow a benefactive object, as with 
mem bawakan ‘carry’, whose English translation requires the 
beneﬁ ciary to be expressed by a phrase beginning with ‘for’:
Sopir membawakan saya koper yang berat.
The driver carried the heavy cases for me.
Some other verbs whose English translation does not allow a 
benefactive object are:
mencucikan wash (for)
membukakan open (for)
mengangkatkan lift (for)

86 Words
mencarikan seek (for), look (for)
menutupkan close/cover (for)
The verb menuliskan has a benefactive object:
Dia menuliskan ayahnya surat.
He wrote a letter for his father.
The English verb ‘to write’ does not allow a benefactive object, 
although it does allow an object indicating the person to whom 
the letter is sent, the recipient, in a sentence like ‘He wrote his 
father a letter’. In Indonesian this recipient must be expressed by 
a phrase with kepada:
Dia menulis surat kepada ayahnya.
He wrote his father a letter/He wrote a letter to his father.
All verbs which can take benefactive -kan can also occur without 
the sufﬁ x. However, if it does not occur, the object must be the 
patient and the beneﬁ ciary must be expressed by a phrase begin-
ning with untuk, buat or bagi ‘for’:
Pelayan mengambil segelas air untuk tamu.
The waiter fetched a glass of water for the guest.
When benefactive -kan does occur, it signals that the action is 
done for someone’s beneﬁ t even if that person is not mentioned. 
Thus:
Pelayan mengambilkan segelas air.
The waiter fetched (someone) a glass of water.
Such constructions are common in contexts where it is clear for 
whose beneﬁ t the action is performed. Perhaps because of such 
constructions forms with benefactive -kan and a beneﬁ ciary 
expressed in a prepositional phrase beginning with untuk, buat 
or bagi have developed in modern Indonesian:10
Pelayan mengambilkan segelas air untuk tamu.
The waiter fetched a glass of water for the guest.
 Aku membelikan bermacam-macam perhiasan untuk 
isteriku.
I bought lots of jewellery for my wife.

 Afﬁ xes 87
Many verbs cannot take benefactive -kan. These include all verbs 
with which -kan is required to produce a well-formed transi-
tive verb, such as discussed in section 1.190, and to form caus-
ative verbs, discussed in sections 1.191ff. Verbs which describe 
actions which are not normally done for someone else, such as 
makan ‘eat’, also cannot take benefactive -kan.
With these verbs the beneﬁ ciary must be expressed in a 
beneﬁ ciary phrase (see 2.211). In the following example, tamu 
‘guest’ cannot occur as object because base beres ‘in order’ must 
take -kan to form a causative verb (see 1.192); therefore -kan 
cannot occur with this verb to indicate that the object is the 
beneﬁ ciary:
Ibu membereskan kamar untuk tamu.
Mother arranged the room for the guest.
Sufﬁ x -kan with two functions
If a transitive verb can occur without a sufﬁ x, the possibility 
exists for it to add -kan to indicate that someone else is caused 
to do the action (see 1.191ff) or to mark the object as instru-
ment (see 1.205) or beneﬁ ciary (see 1.206). Thus menjahit 
‘sew’ allows the addition of -kan to show that the subject gets 
someone else to perform the action or that the subject performs 
the action for someone else’s beneﬁ t:
Saya menjahitkan kemeja ke tukang jahit.
I had my shirt sewn by that tailor.
Tukang jahit itu menjahitkan saya kemeja baru.
That tailor sewed me a new shirt.
Other verbs which allow the addition of -kan with these two 
functions include:
mencuci wash
menimbang weigh
memeriksa inspect, check
memikul bear, carry on the shoulder
The verb menulis ‘write’ allows -kan with both instrumental 
and benefactive meanings:
Dia menuliskan spidolnya ke baju saya.
He wrote with a marker on my shirt.
1.207
1.208

Dia menuliskan ayahnya surat.

Other verbs which allow -kan with these two functions 
include:
membelikan buy with (money); buy for (someone)
memotongkan chop with (something); chop for (someone)
membalutkan wrap with (something); wrap for (someone)
Other functions of -kan
Sometimes meanings occur in addition to those noted above. 
Thus, in addition to meaning ‘read for someone’, mem bacakan 
can mean ‘read aloud, recite’: membacakan puisi ‘recite poetry’. 
As well as meaning ‘carry for someone’, membawakan can 
mean ‘convey, present, perform’: membawakan lagu ‘present a 
song’. As well as the two meanings given above, menuliskan can 
mean ‘write down’: menuliskan pikiran ‘write down (one’s) 
thoughts’. Some other simple transitive verbs which can add 
-kan to form a verb whose meaning cannot be put into any of 
the above categories include:
melukis paint 
melukiskan describe
mendapat get 
mendapatkan discover, obtain
mendengar hear 
mendengarkan listen to
menunjuk point to 
menunjukkan indicate
Optional -kan
With a number of words -kan can be omitted without change 
of meaning. Most, though not all, such verbs are in the group in 
section 1.190 above. Thus, both mengantar and mengantarkan 
mean ‘accompany’:
Utomo mengantar/mengantarkan ibunya ke pasar.
Utomo accompanied his mother to the market.
In the following examples, optional -kan is indicated in paren-
theses:
melempar(kan) throw 
mengirim(kan) send
menanam(kan) plant 
merusak(kan) damage
menuang(kan) pour 
menyebut(kan) mention
memberi(kan) give 
menitip(kan) entrust

 Afﬁ xes 89
menyumbang(kan)  
mengantar(kan) accompany

In a few cases, the optionality of -kan is different in active and 
passive voice. This is discussed in section 3.35.
Transitive verbs with sufﬁ x -i
Sufﬁ x -i has two major functions: to indicate that the object 
is the location of the action and to indicate repeated action. 
Bases ending in -i (such as beri ‘to give’) do not occur with this 
sufﬁ x.
Locative -i
The most common function of -i is to indicate that the object is 
the place where the action occurs or the person or place to which 
the action is directed. When the action is directed at a person, that 
participant is called the recipient; when it is located or directed at 
a place, that participant is the location. Both these participants 
are referred to as location if there is no need to distinguish them. 
These participant roles are further discussed in section 3.17.
Many -i locative verbs have noun bases. The largest group of 
these mean ‘apply or give [base] to the object’. Thus, in the 
examples below menandatangani ‘sign’ means that the base 
tandatangan ‘signature’ is applied to the object surat ‘letter’ and 
menghormati ‘honour’ means that the base hormat ‘honour’ is 
applied to the object orang tua ‘parents’:
Dia menandatangani surat.
She signed the letter.
Kita harus menghormati orang tua kita.
We must honour/respect our parents.
Other verbs with noun bases and sufﬁ x -i with this function 
include:
mengilhami inspire 
mewawancarai interview
melukai wound 
menangani tackle, handle
meracuni poison 
mengampuni forgive
meminyaki oil 
mempengaruhi inﬂ uence
mengakhiri end 
mengipasi fan

merestui bless 
membohongi lie to
mengisi ﬁ ll 
menilai evaluate
menghargai appreciate, respect
mengobati apply medicine to, treat
In a few cases, the verb means that what is expressed by the base 
is removed from the object rather than applied to it. This is also 
generally the case with English equivalents of such verbs:
menyisiki scale (ﬁ sh)
menguliti skin, peel
mengutui delouse, remove lice
menulangi remove bones
membului pluck, remove feathers
merumputi weed, remove weeds
In both English and Indonesian removal, rather than addition, 
is meant when removal is the action typically applied to the 
object. However, in speciﬁ c contexts addition may be indicated 
by the same verbs. Thus, in the expression menguliti buku ‘cover 
a book’, the verb menguliti indicates the addition of something 
rather than the removal of something, as does membului in 
membului anak panah ‘feather an arrow’.
Another major group of -i verbs with noun bases mean ‘act 
as/be [base] with reference to object’. Thus in the examples 
below Pak Irwan acts as sutradara ‘director’ of the movie 
and petenis Amerika itu is juara ‘champion’ of the tennis 
tournament:
Pak Irwan menyutradarai ﬁ lm itu.
Mr Irwan directed that movie.
Petenis Amerika itu menjuarai turnamen tenis itu.
 The American tennis player won the tennis tournament.
Other verbs with noun bases and sufﬁ x -i with this function 
include:

mengepalai head, lead
mewakili represent
merajai rule (over)
membuntuti trail after
melandasi underly, be the base for
mengawali precede
memusuhi treat with hostility
mendalangi mastermind, manipulate
Sufﬁ x -i occurs with a limited number of adjective bases. Most 
of these bases also occur with causative -kan (see 1.192). The -i 
form usually indicates that something is applied to the object; it 
thus has a locative rather than causative meaning. So memanasi 
(air) ‘heat (water) by applying heat to it’, memanaskan (air) ‘heat 
(water), for instance, by moving it into the heat’; mengasini (ikan) 
‘salt (ﬁ sh) by adding salt to it’, mengasinkan (ikan) ‘salt ﬁ sh, for 
instance, by placing it in salt water’; memerahi (bibir) ‘redden 
(lips) by applying something red to them’, memerahkan ‘redden 
by any means’; mengeringi (sawah) ‘dry (rice ﬁ eld) by draining 
water from it’, mengeringkan ‘dry, for instance, by putting out in 
sun’. Other verbs in this group include:
membasahi wet, dampen
memberati weigh down
memenuhi ﬁ ll, fulﬁ l
mencemari pollute, contaminate
menelanjangi uncover (secret); strip
menerangi light, illuminate
menghitami blacken
mengotori dirty, befoul
mengurangi reduce
A few -i verbs based on adjectives have somewhat different 
meanings, where the function of -i is not easily distinguished 
from that of -kan, including:
melengkapi complete
mendalami deepen
1.215
1.216

92 Words
menghabisi ﬁ nish off
mengurangi reduce
With bases indicating approximation or relative position, the 
-i verb means ‘become the distance or location indicated by 
the base vis-à-vis the object’. Thus menjauhi ‘avoid’ literally 
means ‘become jauh (far) from’. Bases are from a number of 
word classes, including some locative nouns (see 2.120); thus 
membawahi ‘be underneath’, from bawah ‘underneath’:
melalui pass (lalu past)
melampaui pass by, exceed (lampau past)
mendampingi ﬂ ank, stand beside (damping close)
mendekati approach (dekat near)
menengahi intervene; mediate (tengah little)
menghampiri approach (hampir near)
menjauhi avoid (jauh far)
A large number of -i verbs have verbal bases and objects which 
indicate location. These verbs have intransitive counterparts, as 
in the following examples:
berbohong lie 
membohongi lie to
berkerumun swarm 
mengerumuni swarm over
datang come 
mendatangi visit, come to
duduk sit 
menduduki sit on, occupy
hadir be present 
menghadiri attend
jatuh fall 
menjatuhi fall on
melangkah step 
melangkahi step over
melompat jump 
melompati jump over
tidur sleep 
meniduri sleep on
In the following cases, the meaning of ‘location’ should be inter-
preted in a ﬁ gurative sense:
menangis weep 
menangisi weep over
menikah get married 
menikahi marry (someone)
percaya believe 
mempercayai ‘trust, believe’
Intransitive verbs such as those in the list in section 1.218 may 
take a prepositional phrase to indicate place, means and so on 
(see 2.130), in which case the intransitive verb plus pre position 
1.217

usually means the same as, or something very similar to, the 
corresponding transitive verb:
Mereka hadir (di rapat itu).
They were present (at the meeting).
Mereka menghadiri rapat itu.
They attended the meeting.
Dia sudah menikah (dengan gadis itu).
He has married (that girl).
Dia sudah menikahi gadis itu.
He has married that girl.
For some of these intransitive verbs a prepositional phrase is 
obligatory, as with tinggal di ‘dwell in’, the intransitive verb and 
preposition corresponding in function to the -i verb. Among 
verbs typically behaving like this are the emotives, those which 
express emotions directed towards someone or something, such 
as cinta ‘love’ (prepositions following such intransitive verbs are 
variable, as discussed in section 2.130):
Siapa yang tinggal di rumah ini?
Siapa yang meninggali rumah ini?
Who lives in this house?
Pak Basri cinta pada istrinya.
Pak Basri mencintai istrinya.
Mr Basri loves his wife.
The following list exempliﬁ es intransitive verbs which rarely 
occur without a following preposition, together with their 
transitive -i counterparts. Typical prepositions are also given. 
With a few verbs prepositions are optional, as indicated by 
parentheses:

In a few cases there is some difference in meaning between the 
intransitive verb plus preposition and the corresponding -i 
verb:
marah pada angry at 
memarahi scold
setuju dengan agree 
menyetujui agree with, 
  with (person or action)    approve (action)
All the -i verbs with verbal bases discussed in section 1.219 relate 
to intransitive verbs with a following preposition. However, not 
all -i verbs with verbal bases correspond to intransitive verbs in 
this way. Relating to some -i verbs are intransitive verbs which 
are inherently reﬂ exive, such as menyerah ‘surrender (oneself)’, 
menyerahi ‘hand over to, entrust to’. For others there is no 
corresponding intransitive verb. Some -i verbs relate to transi-
tive simple verbs. Thus menulis ‘write’, menulisi (kertas) ‘write 
on (paper)’. Among verbs which do not correspond in meaning 
to an intransitive verb plus preposition are:
melayani serve
mengulangi repeat
mempunyai have, possess
merintangi block, hamper
menaburi sprinkle
menyelidiki investigate
mengolesi smear
menutupi cover
menghalangi prevent, hamper
Another group of -i verbs are those sometimes called ditransitive 
verbs, which are further discussed in section 3.20. These verbs 
have a primary object and a secondary object. With ditransi-
tive -i verbs the primary object represents the recipient of the 
action; that is, the one at whom the action is directed, and the 
secondary object represents the patient. This group is exempli-
ﬁ ed by mengirimi ‘send to’ and menyerahi ‘hand over to’:
Ayah mengirimi saya uang.
Father sent me money.
Kepala kantor menyerahi kami tugas yang berat.
The ofﬁ ce head assigned us a heavy task.

Almost all these verbs have counterparts with sufﬁ x -kan, with 
which the object represents the patient (see 1.190ff). A number 
of verbs with noun bases are also ditransitive and can be placed 
in this group, such as menghadiahi ‘give to (object) as a hadiah 
(gift)’. Some verbs in this group are given below, along with 
typical primary and secondary objects:
memberi (dia uang) give (him money)
menawari (dia pekerjaan) offer (him a job)
menamai (dia Ali) name (him Ali)
menyuguhi (tamu minuman) offer (the guests a drink)
melimpahi (dia harta) give (him wealth) in abundance
menghadiahi (dia buku) give (him a book) as a gift
 menganugerahi (mereka seorang putri) bless (them with a 
daughter)
meminjami (dia buku) lend (him a book)
menyodori (dia buku) hand (him a book)
mencurahi (dia kekayaan) bestow upon (him wealth)
There are many other -i verbs which are not ditransitive but 
which nevertheless have counterparts with -kan. The par ticipant 
which is object with the -kan verb occurs in a dengan phrase 
with the -i verb. (The relationship between -i and -kan verbs is 
further discussed in sections 1.229ff.) The following exemplify 
such -i verbs in sentences:
Dia menanami sawahnya dengan padi.
He planted his ﬁ eld with rice.
Para demonstran melempari wartawan dengan batu.
The demonstrators pelted the journalists with stones.
The prepositional phrase in such constructions is optional:
Dia menanami sawahnya.
He planted his ﬁ eld.
Some other verbs in this group are given below, with typical 
objects and dengan phrases:
menyirami (bunga dengan air) spray (ﬂ owers with water)
mengolesi (badan dengan minyak) smear (body with oil)
melayani (tamu dengan makanan) serve (guest with food)
memuati (truk dengan batu bara) load (truck with coal)

 membebani (orang dengan tugas) burden (person with 
duty)
menaburi (makanan dengan garam) sprinkle (food with salt)
menghiasi (kamar dengan mawar) decorate (room with roses)
 membanjiri (negeri itu dengan uang) ﬂ ood (the country 
with money)
menutupi (mata dengan tangan) cover (eyes with hand)
menulisi (kertas dengan pena) write on (paper with pen)
English verbs translating -i locative verbs usually allow 
the same object, as in the above examples, although with a 
few verbs the Indonesian must be paraphrased or a differ-
ent verb chosen. For instance, melampiri ‘enclose’ can take 
surat ‘letter’ as object where the corresponding English verb 
cannot; the English verb ‘enclose’ requires a patient as object 
and thus is actually a translation of the corresponding -kan 
verb:
Ayah melampiri surat dengan kwitansi.
Father enclosed a receipt in the letter.
Other verbs which must be translated into English by a para-
phrase include:
 menghujani (musuh dengan bom) rain on (enemy with 
bombs)
menuangi (cangkir dengan teh) pour into (cup with tea)
The preposition dengan ‘with’ can be omitted under certain 
circumstances in a passive construction (see 3.37).
Verbs with and without -i
Some verbs occur in simple transitive form or with sufﬁ x -i 
with different meanings. Besides those differences which can be 
accounted for in terms of the regular functions of -i, such as 
menulis ‘write’, menulisi ‘write on’, are differences in meaning 
which are restricted to particular verbs and are usually unpre-
dictable, such as:
meliput cover an event 
meliputi cover
  (of a journalist) 
mendapat get 
mendapati ﬁ nd
menunggu wait (for) 
menunggui watch over

mengenal know 
mengenali recognise,

mengajari teach, train,

mengurus arrange,  
mengurusi look after
  organise
Optional -i
With a number of words locative -i can be omitted without 
change of meaning. Thus both menyeberang and menye-
berangi mean ‘cross over’:
Kita bisa menyeberang/menyeberangi jalan di sini.
We can cross the road here.
In the following examples, optional -i is indicated in parentheses:
menyiram(i) spray
menghias(i) decorate
mengikut(i) follow, obey
menerobos(i) break through
menggunjing(i) speak badly of
mendamprat(i) abuse, insult
mengiring(i) accompany
menurut(i) follow
menyuluh(i) light, illuminate
mencicip(i) nibble
There is a considerable amount of variation in what differ-
ent speakers regard as acceptable. Thus some allow mengirim 
instead of mengirimi ‘send (someone something)’, while others 
regard -i as obligatory.11 Also, the frequency with which -i occurs 
when it is optional varies from word to word. For some speakers 
addition of -i to some words changes their meaning, while for 
others the sufﬁ x is optional and does not change the meaning. 
Thus, some people distinguish mengajar (mereka) ‘teach 
(them)’ and mengajari (mereka) ‘train (them)’; others treat this 
as simply a case of optional -i. Some people distinguish intran-
sitive menyeberang ‘cross over’ and transitive menyeberangi, 
although other Indo nesians treat the -i as optional before an 
object (but obligatorily absent if there is no object—see 3.21).

Locative verbs without -i
A number of verbs occur as simple transitives where -i might be 
expected because the object is locative. Thus menyumbang has 
a locative object, this participant being marked by kepada with 
the corresponding -kan verb:
Kami menyumbang mereka dengan uang.
We support them with money.
Kami menyumbangkan uang kepada mereka.
We contribute money to them.
Some verbs in this group have -kan counterparts with ‘instru-
mental’ meaning (see 1.205). Some others have noun bases (see 
1.188). Among these verbs are:
mengetuk (pintu) knock on (door)
menyemprot spray
menambah (pengetahuan) add to (knowledge)
menyemir polish
mengingat remember
memborgol handcuff
memberitahu tell
menginjak tread on
A few verbs which have locative objects and intransitive verb 
plus preposition counterparts (see 1.219) do not have sufﬁ x -i. 
These include mengenal ‘know’ and mengingat ‘remember’:
Saya kenal/ingat akan dia.
Saya mengenal/mengingat dia.
I know/remember him.
Repetitive -i
Sufﬁ x -i can be added to a number of simple transitive verbs 
to indicate that the action is performed more than once. The 
precise meaning of -i depends on the context and the partic-
ular verb base. It may indicate action done separately to a 
number of objects or repeated action on the one object, either 
by one actor or more. The difference is shown by the following 
examples:
Dia mencium pacarnya.
He kissed his girlfriend.
1.225
1.226

 Afﬁ xes 99
Dia menciumi pacarnya.
He kissed his girlfriend repeatedly/a number of times.
Kami akan menjemput mereka.
We will collect them.
Kami akan menjemputi mereka.
We will collect them (in more than one trip).
Mereka menebang pohon di depan rumahnya.
They chopped down the tree in front of their house.
Mereka menebangi pohon di sekitar rumahnya.
They chopped down the trees around their house.
With the following examples the gloss does not distinguish the 
different possibilities:
mengambili fetch repeatedly
memukuli hit repeatedly
mengangkati lift repeatedly
menggigiti bite repeatedly
menggaruki scratch repeatedly
membungkusi wrap (many things)
menembaki shoot repeatedly
menjuali sell off, sell (many things)
menutupi shut (many things)
With some verbs -i indicates intensity or thoroughness. 
Thus memandang means ‘look at’, while memandangi means 
‘gaze at’:
Tiap pasang mata memandangi kami.
Each pair of eyes gazed at us.
Other verbs indicating intensity include:
membakari burn up completely
melihati scrutinise, look at intently
memegangi grip, hold tightly
memeriksai inspect carefully
With a few verbs, such as memakani ‘eat up’, the meanings of 
repetition and thoroughness are not clearly distinguished:
Burung itu memakani padi.
The birds ate up the rice.
1.227

100 Words
With several verbs -i incorporates both a locative object and 
repeated or intensive action. Thus melempari means ‘throw 
(many things) at’, a meaning also conveyed by the English 
translation ‘pelt’ (as in the example in section 1.222). The verb 
menanyai corresponds to the intransitive verb plus prep osition 
bertanya kepada ‘ask’, but for most people it also suggests 
intensity or thoroughness, thus meaning ‘question, interrogate’, 
rather than just ‘ask’:
Polisi menanyai tersangka.
The police interrogated the suspect.
Many verbs cannot take repetitive -i. This includes all verbs 
which do not have a simple transitive form but with which -i or 
-kan is required to produce a well-formed transitive verb. With 
such verbs repetition must be indicated by an adjunct, such as 
berkali-kali ‘repeatedly’ or berulang-ulang ‘over and over’, as in 
the following example:
Tanaman itu disiraminya berkali-kali.
He watered the plant repeatedly.
Such adjuncts can also replace -i in verbs where it has a repeti-
tive function:
Dia mencium pacarnya berkali-kali.
He kissed his girlfriend again and again/repeatedly.
Sufﬁ xes -kan and -i compared
Many verbs can take both -kan and -i, usually with a clear 
distinction in meaning, -kan marking the object as patient and 
-i marking it as location or recipient (see 3.17). The -i verb 
may be ditransitive (see 1.221) or have only a single object (see 
1.222):
Mereka menawarkan bantuan kepada saya.
They offered help to me.
Mereka menawari saya bantuan.
They offered me help.
Buruh itu memuatkan beras ke kapal.
The workers loaded the rice onto the ship.
Buruh itu memuati kapal dengan beras.
The workers loaded the ship with rice.

 Afﬁ xes 101
Sopir memasukkan mobil ke dalam garasi.
The driver put the car into the garage.
Mobil memasuki garasi.
The car entered the garage.
Not all verbs with verbal bases take both sufﬁ xes. Many verbs, 
including menyewakan ‘lend’, have no corresponding -i forms:
Parno menyewakan rumahnya kepada keluarga Sugito.
Parno rented his house to the Sugito family.
There is no -kan form corresponding to a number of -i verbs, 
such as menghiasi ‘decorate’:
Dia menghiasi kamarnya dengan bunga.
She decorated her room with ﬂ owers.
With a number of words the distinction between -kan and -i is 
blurred in common usage.
In some cases, both -i and -kan occur with the same meaning. 
With some there is a recipient or locative object, while with 
others the object is the patient:
menamai, menamakan name
mengenai, mengenakan subject to
mengingini, menginginkan desire
menyakiti, menyakitkan hurt
 menyembahyangi, menyembahyangkan pray over, conduct 
service for
mendoai, mendoakan pray for
menghamili, menghamilkan make pregnant
Mereka menamai/menamakan anaknya Ali.
They named their child Ali.
Goenawan dikenai/dikenakan skorsing dua tahun.
Goenawan was subjected to a two-year disqualiﬁ cation.
With these words both forms are generally acceptable. Neverthe-
less, there is a considerable amount of confusion in the minds of 
many people as to which sufﬁ x is appropriate with certain verbs. 
Typical is the use of menugaskan instead of menugasi ‘assign’, 
literally ‘give tugas (duty/assignment) to’. While purists insist 
1.230

102 Words
on the -i form, use of -kan is common, even among educated 
people:12
 Mereka menugasi/(menugaskan) dia mengadakan observasi.
They assigned him to carry out observations.
In the active, but not in passive, voice memberikan commonly 
occurs with a recipient object, although in this case also purists 
regard the -kan form as ungrammatical:
Ibu memberi/(memberikan) anaknya baju baru.
Mother gave her son a new shirt.
In the case of memberikan and mengenakan, referred to above, 
purists accept only a patient object:
Ibu memberikan baju baru kepada anaknya.
Mother gave a new shirt to her son.
Skorsing dua tahun dikenakan pada Goenawan.
A disqualiﬁ cation of two years was applied to Goenawan.
Some -kan verbs have a recipient or locative object. Reference is 
made in section 1.197 to -kan verbs having a locative meaning with 
emotive adjective bases, such as mencemaskan ‘be appre hensive 
about’. In such cases, an intransitive emotive verb plus preposition 
(see 1.219) corresponds to a -kan transitive verb rather than an -i 
verb: bangga akan, membanggakan ‘be proud of’.
Occurrence of -i where -kan would be expected is rarer (see 
also 1.216). The -i form mengantongi (uang) ‘pocket (money)’ 
has a patient object (compare memenjarakan (penjahat) ‘jail 
(a criminal)’). Many people use menakut-nakuti (anak) (with 
obligatory reduplication) ‘frighten (a child)’ instead of mena-
kutkan, although others also recognise menakuti ‘fear’ with a 
locative object.
With some verbs acceptability of forms differs between active and 
passive constructions. This is discussed in section 3.35.
Transitive verbs with preﬁ x per-
Preﬁ x per- can occur alone or in combination with -kan and 
-i. Examples are given in the active voice, with preﬁ xation

 Afﬁ xes 103
memper-. Verbs formed with the combination of per- and -kan 
are discussed in sections 1.239–44; those formed with per- and 
-i are discussed in section 1.245.
Per- can occur with adjective bases to form causative verbs. It is 
sometimes stated that such verbs differ from causatives with -kan 
(see 1.192) in that with -kan the object is caused to take on a charac-
teristic it did not previously have, while with per- the object already 
has the characteristic and is caused to have it in greater degree. 
Thus from besar ‘big’ is derived membesarkan ‘make big some-
thing which is not big’ and memperbesar ‘make bigger something 
which is already big’. Other people recognise no contrast between 
the two afﬁ xes, regarding per- verbs simply as indicating that the 
object is caused to have the characteristic of the base, whether it 
already had the characteristic to some degree or not. It is probable 
there is considerable variation in usage between different speakers, 
with many people making no distinction between the functions of 
the two afﬁ xes. Causative verbs with per- include:
memperkecil reduce, make small (kecil small)
mempercepat speed up (cepat fast)
memperkuat strengthen (kuat strong)
mempersempit make narrow (sempit narrow)
memperpanjang extend, make longer (panjang long)
mempermudah make easy (mudah easy)
memperkaya enrich (kaya rich)
memperlemah weaken (lemah weak)
Afﬁ xes per- and -kan cannot always substitute for each other 
with adjective bases. Thus memperpanjang ‘lengthen/extend 
(the time of the object)’, as in memperpanjang visa ‘extend a visa’ 
and memperdalam ‘deepen’, as in memperdalam pen getahuan 
‘deepen knowledge’, cannot be replaced by memanjangkan 
‘lengthen’ and mendalamkan ‘deepen’ respectively, which apply 
only to physical objects.
With some bases one afﬁ x or the other does not occur or is 
very infrequent. Thus memperkaya ‘enrich’ is common while 
it is doubtful if many people use mengayakan. Only memper-
indah means ‘beautify’, mengindahkan, meaning ‘pay atten-
tion to’, having a different base.13 While per- is less frequent 
1.235

104 Words
with most bases than -kan, it is nevertheless productive and 
can occur with new adjectives, such as canggih ‘sophisticated’, 
a word which was introduced in the mid-1980s:
 Negara-negara Asia mencoba mempercanggih kemam-
puan militernya.
 The Asian countries are trying to make their military 
capability (more) sophisticated.
To produce causative verbs per- occurs only with adjective 
bases, not with intransitive verb bases. Thus there is no per- 
form corresponding to -kan causatives such as membangunkan 
‘wake (someone) up’ and memandikan ‘bathe (someone)’.
A small number of per- verbs are based on nouns and mean 
‘treat the object as [base]’ or ‘take the object as [base]’. Thus 
memperistri ‘take as wife, marry’:
Saya tidak dapat memperistri gadis seperti dia.
I can’t marry a girl like her.
Other verbs in this group include:
memperbudak enslave; treat like a slave
mempersuami take as husband, marry
memperalat make use of (someone); use as an instrument
mempertuan treat as (one’s) master
memperkuda exploit, work (object) like a horse
memperdewa deify, treat like a god, idolise
memperadik regard as a younger sibling
per- also occurs with cardinal numbers from ‘two’ to ‘four’ to 
derive verbs meaning ‘cause to be so many parts, divide into so 
many parts’:
memperdua divide into two parts
mempertiga divide into three parts
memperempat divide into four parts
Belonging to this group is memperbanyak ‘multiply, increase 
the number of’:
Mereka memperbanyak senjatanya.
They increased the number of their weapons.

Transitive verbs with afﬁ xation per-…-kan
This afﬁ xation occurs with some adjective bases to produce 
causative verbs:
mempermalukan shame, embarrass
memperhebatkan intensify
memperbesarkan enlarge
Where it occurs with adjective bases, per-…-kan has the same 
meaning as per- (see 1.235). Thus memperhebatkan could be 
replaced by memperhebat in the following sentence:
 Serikat buruh memutuskan untuk memperhebatkan 
kampanye.
The trade union has decided to intensify its campaign.
These verbs probably result from confusion between per- and 
-kan forms and are not accepted by all speakers. Some, such 
as mempermalukan, have wide acceptability and tend to be 
included in dictionaries, while others, such as memperbesar-
kan, tend to be excluded from dictionaries.
A very limited number of per-…-kan verbs occur with noun 
bases. Some of these are synonymous with memper- forms. 
Thus memperdewa, memperdewakan ‘deify; idolise’. There 
is uncertainty about the meaning of two forms; some people 
treat memperistrikan and mempersuamikan as meaning 
the same as memperistri and mempersuami respectively 
(see 1.236), while others make a distinction, memperistri/
suamikan meaning ‘marry off (son/daughter), cause (son/
daughter) to take a spouse’.14 The verb mempermadukan ‘take 
a second wife, provide (wife) with a co-wife’ has no correspond-
ing form without -kan.
Also in this group are the following:
memperdebatkan debate (over)
mempersoalkan dispute, question
mempermasalahkan dispute, question
mempersengketakan dispute, quarrel over

With verb bases per-…-kan has several functions. With some 
bases it simply identiﬁ es the object as the patient of the action, 
being required with those bases to produce well-formed verbs. 
With some verbs per- is optional; the corresponding -kan verb 
has the same meaning. In such cases, both forms are given in the 
following examples:
memperebutkan struggle over
mempertimbangkan weigh up, consider
memperhitungkan calculate, estimate
mempermainkan make fun of
mempertahankan maintain, defend
memperjuangkan struggle for
mempercakapkan talk about
memperlakukan treat
mempertunjukkan present, perform
memperbandingkan/membandingkan compare
mempersilakan/menyilakan invite (to do something)
memperdagangkan/mendagangkan deal in, trade in
mempertontonkan/menontonkan exhibit
Another group of per-…-kan verbs indicate that the object is 
caused to perform the action of the corresponding intransi-
tive verb. Thus mempersatukan ‘unite’ means ‘cause the object 
to unite (bersatu)’. Other verbs in this group are better para-
phrased ‘regard the object as [base], treat the object as [base]’. 
With a number of these verbs also per- is optional. Correspond-
ing intransitive verbs are given in parentheses:
mempekerjakan employ (bekerja work)
mempertemukan unite (bertemu meet)
mempermandikan baptise (mandi bathe)
mempergunakan/menggunakan use (berguna useful)
mempersiapkan/menyiapkan prepare (bersiap get ready)
 memperbedakan/membedakan distinguish (berbeda be 
different)
mempersatukan/menyatukan unite (bersatu be united)
A very small group of per-…-kan verbs are based on simple 
transitive verbs. These indicate that the subject causes another 
person to carry out the action. The one who carries out the 
1.241
1.242
1.243

 Afﬁ xes 107
action is expressed in a phrase beginning with kepada/pada. 
Thus melihat ‘see’, memperlihatkan ‘cause (someone) to see; 
show’:
Harun melihat gambar-gambar saya.
Harun saw my drawings.
 Saya memperlihatkan gambar-gambar saya kepada Harun.
I showed my drawings to Harun.
A larger group of verbs with this function have only sufﬁ x -kan, 
as discussed in section 1.200, while with one verb in this group 
per- is optional:
 memperkenalkan/mengenalkan introduce (mengenal 
know)
As examples in sections 1.241–3 show, some per-…-kan verbs 
are synonymous with -kan verbs. This is not always the case; 
some per-…-kan verbs have no corresponding -kan forms. In 
other cases both forms occur but with different meanings, as 
with the following:
mendengarkan listen to 
memperdengarkan perform, 
let (object) be heard
mengerjakan do, perform 
mempekerjakan employ
menunjukkan indicate 
mempertunjukkan perform, 
display
melakukan do, carry out 
memperlakukan treat
memandikan bathe 
mempermandikan baptise
mengatakan say 
memperkatakan talk about, 
deliberate over
menanyakan ask about 
mempertanyakan question
Transitive verbs with afﬁ xation per-…-i
This afﬁ xation occurs with only a limited number of verbs; it 
is not productive. Sometimes per- can be deleted, as indicated 
in the list below. Two verbs are based on adjectives and have a 
causative meaning. The others are based on verbs; with these 
per-…-i functions like -i:
memperbaiki ﬁ x, repair
memperba(ha)rui/memba(ha)rui renew, repair
mempelajari study
1.244
1.245

108 Words
memperlengkapi/melengkapi equip; complement
mempersenjatai arm
memperingati commemorate
memperlindungi/melindungi protect, shelter
In the case of one verb, the per- form contrasts with the 
non-per- form: mempelajari ‘study’, mengajari ‘teach, train’.
Secondary verbs
Among secondary verbal forms there is considerable 
variation in function. In most cases, primary afﬁ xation is 
deleted. Secondary verbal forms are base-meN-base form (such 
as pukul-memukul), and verbs with afﬁ xation ber-…-an, 
ber-…-kan, ter-, ke-…-an and ke-.
Base-meN-base verbs
This derivation, as in pukul-memukul, usually occurs with 
certain basic transitive verbs. It consists of the verb base 
followed by the active voice form of the verb. There are two 
groups of verbs with this structure, one group indicating 
reciprocal action and one group indicating ‘anything to do 
with [base]’.
Reciprocal base-meN-base verbs
The verb indicates that two people do the same thing to each 
other. Corresponding verbs in English have ‘each other’ as 
object:
Mereka pukul-memukul.
They hit each other.
Kedua keluarga itu selalu tolong-menolong.
Those two families are always helping each other.
As the above examples show, these verbs occur in intransitive 
constructions, the subject expressing both actor and patient of 
the corresponding basic verb. They therefore have no passive 
transformations.
If a sufﬁ x occurs with the basic verb this is usually retained, 
although verbs with -kan rarely enter this construction:
peluk-memeluk embrace each other

 Afﬁ xes 109
telpon-menelpon telephone each other
tikam-menikam stab each other
harga-menghargai respect each other
cinta-mencintai love each other
jauh-menjauhi avoid each other
maaf-memaafkan forgive each other
In a few cases, sufﬁ x -i of the corresponding basic verb is 
deleted:
 surat-menyurat correspond, write to each other (menyurati 
write to)
kunjung-mengunjung visit each other (mengunjungi visit)
While reciprocal verbs can be based on only a limited number 
of basic transitive verbs, forms like telpon-menelpon ‘telephone 
each other’ show that there is some degree of productivity.
With some verbs the two participants stand not as actor and 
patient but as actor and recipient (see 3.17). These verbs have 
a complement (see 3.65), corresponding to the object of the 
related basic verb. The reciprocal participants can both be 
expressed by the subject. Sometimes one participant can alter-
natively be expressed by a prepositional phrase beginning with 
dengan ‘with’:
Yanti dan Lia tukar-menukar hadiah Natal.
Yanti and Lia exchanged Christmas presents.
Yanti tukar-menukar hadiah Natal dengan Lia.
Yanti exchanges Christmas presents with Lia.
Other verbs in this group are:
tawar-menawar bargain (with someone)
pinjam-meminjam borrow (from each other)
Two verbs in this group do not have a transitive verb as a base. 
One of these verbs is bahu-membahu ‘work shoulder-to-shoul-
der’ (based on bahu ‘shoulder’):
Dia bahu-membahu dengan rekannya.
He worked shoulder-to-shoulder with his colleagues.
The other verb is tahu-menahu (see 1.253).
1.249
1.250

For the majority of basic verbs, no reciprocal form occurs. With 
these reciprocity can be indicated by saling (see 2.160), which 
can also occur instead of a reciprocal form:
Mereka kunjung-mengunjung.
Mereka saling mengunjungi.
They visit each other.
The two forms are sometimes redundantly combined:
Mereka saling kunjung-mengunjung.
They visit each other.
Other reciprocal verbs have afﬁ xation ber- (see 1.173) or 
ber-…-an (see 1.255).
Verbs meaning ‘everything/anything to do with’
Based on basic transitive verbs which do not refer to activi-
ties which can normally be reciprocal, because the object is 
not typically a person, this form means ‘everything/anything 
to do with [base], affairs relating to [base]’. Thus jahit-
menjahit ‘anything to do with sewing’ (menjahit ‘sew’), angkat-
mengangkat ‘anything to do with lifting’ (mengangkat ‘lift’), 
masak-memasak ‘everything to do with cooking, the art of 
cooking’ (memasak ‘cook’):
Kalau soal jahit-menjahit, jangan berikan kepada saya.
If it’s anything to do with sewing, don’t give it to me.
Urusan angkat-mengangkat serahkan kepada kami.
Any lifting there is to do leave to us.
Dia banyak tahu tentang masak-memasak.
She knows a great deal about the art of cooking.15
This function is quite productive; other forms include:
tari-menari anything to do with dancing
karang-mengarang anything to do with writing
sulam-menyulam anything to do with embroidery
lukis-melukis anything to do with painting
ketik-mengetik anything to do with typing
These forms are based only on basic simple transitive verbs. 
As in the above examples, the form is always nominalised (see 
1.251
1.252

 Afﬁ xes 111
3.130), occurring either as the head of a noun phrase or modi-
fying another noun.
A unique form is tidak tahu-menahu ‘know absolutely nothing 
about’. It has the intransitive verb tahu ‘to know’ as a base and 
never occurs without tidak. It is not nominalised, occurring 
as the predicate of a verbal clause, and containing the form 
menahu, which does not otherwise occur:
Yudi tidak tahu-menahu tentang pembunuhan gadis itu.
 Yudi knows absolutely nothing about the murder of that 
girl.
Verbs with ber-…-an
There are two groups of verbs with this afﬁ xation, one group 
indicating reciprocal action and one group indicating random 
action.
Reciprocal ber-…-an verbs
These verbs indicate that two people do the same thing to each 
other, such as bersalaman ‘greet each other by shaking hands’, 
or that two people or things stand in the same relationship to 
each other, such as berdekatan ‘be near each other’:
Mereka bersalaman waktu bertemu.
They shook hands when they met.
Rumah kami berdekatan.
Our houses are near each other.
With many verbs the two participants can be expressed in the 
same phrase, as above, or one can be expressed in a phrase 
beginning with dengan:
Kapal tangki dan kapal barang bertabrakan.
The tanker and the cargo ship collided (with each other).
Kapal tangki bertabrakan dengan kapal barang.
The tanker collided with the cargo ship.
Verbs with afﬁ xation ber-…-an which indicate reciprocal action 
are based on basic transitive verbs. The group includes:
berdesakan push and jostle
berpandangan gaze at each other
1.253
1.254
1.255
1.256

112 Words
bertabrakan collide with each other
berbalasan reply to each other
bersahutan answer back and forth
Most of these verbs can occur with reduplicated base, such as 
berkejar-kejaran ‘chase each other’ (mengejar ‘chase’):
Anak-anak berkejar-kejaran di halaman.
The children are chasing each other in the yard.
A few are always reduplicated in the usage of some people. Other 
verbs which frequently occur with reduplicated base are:
berpukul-pukulan hit each other
bercinta-cintaan love each other
berpeluk-pelukan embrace each other
berdesak-desakan pushing and shoving
Several of these verbs can alternatively be expressed as base 
combined with meN- form (see 1.248):
berpukul-pukulan, pukul-memukul hit each other
berpeluk-pelukan, peluk-memeluk embrace each other
bersaingan, saing-menyaingi compete with each other
bertolong-tolongan, tolong-menolong help each other
However, neither group is very productive and generally there 
is only one possible secondary formation relating to a particu-
lar basic verb. Many verbs have no reciprocal form, reciprocity 
being expressed by saling, as mentioned in sections 1.251 and 
2.160.
With a few verbs the two participants stand as actor and recipi-
ent. With these verbs a complement (see 3.65) occurs, corre-
sponding to an object with the related basic verbs:
Mereka berkirim-kiriman surat.
They send letters to each other.
Mereka berpegangan tangan.
They were holding hands.
Mereka bertukaran cincin.
They exchanged rings.

Of verbs which indicate that two people or things stand in the 
same relationship, a spatial relationship is usually referred to:
berhadapan face each other
berjauhan be far from each other
berseberangan be across from each other
berdampingan be side by side
berbelakangan be back to back
berbatasan border on each other
A few verbs refer to personal relationship:
bermusuhan be enemies with each other
berpacaran be boyfriend and girlfriend to each other
These are similar to reciprocal ber- verbs (see 1.173). However, 
with these verbs the base cannot be regarded as a noun derived 
with -an as no such form exists. In one case, both ber- and 
ber-…-an forms occur: bermusuh, bermusuhan ‘be enemies 
(with each other)’.
Random action ber-…-an verbs
These forms are related to basic intransitive verbs. The subject 
refers to multiple participants, who carry out the action in a 
random, uncoordinated manner. Thus berdesingan means 
‘whizzing in all directions’ (mendesing ‘make a whizzing 
sound’), beterjunan means ‘jump down (of many people acting 
in an uncoordinated manner)’ (terjun ‘jump down’):
Peluru berdesingan.
Bullets were whizzing about in all directions.
Ketika kapal itu terbakar penumpang beterjunan ke laut.
 When the ship caught ﬁ re the passengers jumped into 
the sea.
Since plurality of the subject is implicit, it is rarely indicated 
overtly; however, it can be expressed:
Para saksi mata mulai bermatian.
The eyewitnesses were beginning to die off.

Other verbs in this group include:
berguguran fall (of leaves etc.)
berdatangan come, arrive (from all directions)
beterbangan ﬂ y (in all directions)
bergantungan hang (all over the place)
berlarian running (in all directions)
bermunculan turn up (from all directions)
A few verbs do not imply a plural actor. The verb berjualan ‘sell 
for a living’ (menjual ‘sell’) can have a single actor and can also 
occur with a complement, having the same meaning as berjual 
(see 3.64):
Dia berjualan kuda.
He sells horses for a living.
The verb bepergian simply means ‘go on a trip, travel’ (pergi 
‘go’):
Bepergianlah dengan kereta api!
Travel by train!
The verb berkeliaran ‘wander about’ refers to random, undi-
rected action but can have a single actor. The verb berserakan 
‘scattered about’ refers to things in a random state. These two 
verbs have no corresponding basic verbal forms:
Dia selalu berkeliaran di sini.
He is always wandering about here.
Tiang-tiang bambu berserakan.
Bamboo posts were scattered about.
Verbs with ber-…-kan
Most of these verbs have noun bases. The construction contains 
a noun complement (see 3.65) and has the general meaning 
‘subject has complement as [base]’. Thus, berdasarkan ‘be 
based on’ literally means ‘have complement as a dasar (basis, 
base)’; the ﬁ rst sentence below literally means ‘The philosophy 
of Indonesia has Pancasila as a base’. The word bersenjatakan 
‘be armed with’ literally means ‘have complement as a senjata 
(weapon)’; the second sentence below literally means ‘That 
country has nuclear bombs as weapons’:
1.262

 Afﬁ xes 115
Filsafat Indonesia berdasarkan Pancasila.
The philosophy of Indonesia is based on Pancasila.
Negara itu bersenjatakan bom nuklir.
 That country is armed with nuclear weapons/has nuclear 
weapons.
As in the above examples, these verbs refer not to actions but to 
states; there are no corresponding passive forms. Other verbs in 
this group include:
beranggotakan have as members
bercita-citakan have as an ideal, aspire to
bersendikan have as a pivotal point
berisikan have as contents, contain
beristrikan have as a wife
bertepikan have as an edge, be edged with
With some verbs the sufﬁ x -kan can be omitted. In the follow-
ing examples, optional -kan is indicated in parentheses:
Botol ini berisi(kan) obat.
This bottle contains medicine.
FIS beranggota(kan) lima belas ribu orang.
FIS has ﬁ fteen thousand (people as) members.
 Rumah Sucipto beratap(kan) genting dan berdinding(kan) 
bambu.
Sucipto’s house has a tile roof and bamboo walls.
Some other verbs always retain -kan if there is a comple-
ment. However, corresponding to all ber-…-kan verbs with 
noun bases are ber- verbs with no complement, meaning ‘have 
[base]’ (see 1.170). The ber- verbs in the following examples 
can be compared with the corresponding ber-…-kan verbs 
given in section 1.262:
Pendapatnya tidak berdasar.
His opinion has no basis.
Awas, dia bersenjata.
Careful, he’s armed.
A number of ber-…-kan verbs have verb bases. These also 
form the bases for -an nouns and the ber-…-kan verb means 
1.263
1.264

116 Words
the same as it would if it had the corresponding -an noun as a 
base. Thus bertuliskan means ‘have (complement) as writing 
(tulisan), have (complement) written on it, be inscribed with 
(complement)’; bertutupkan means ‘have (complement) as a 
cover (tutupan), be covered with (complement)’:
Foto-foto presiden dan para menteri bertuliskan ‘for sale’.
 The photos of the president and ministers had ‘for sale’ 
written on them.
Puncak gunung itu bertutupkan salju.
The peak of the mountain is covered in snow.
Other verbs like this, together with corresponding -an nouns, 
include:
berhiaskan have as a decoration (hiasan), be decorated 
with
berlukiskan have as a painting (lukisan), be painted with
berukirkan have as carvings (ukiran)
 berikutkan have as a following attachment (ikutan), 
be followed by
bercoretkan have as grafﬁ ti (coretan), be scrawled with
Such formations are fairly productive in the modern language 
and an increasing number are occurring, especially in journal-
istic style, which are not included in dictionaries.
The verb bermandikan (peluh/cahaya) ‘be bathed in (sweat/
light)’ has no corresponding -an noun.
Verbs with preﬁ x ter-
Most ter- verbs ﬁ t one of three categories: stative, accidental, 
abilitative.
Stative ter- verbs
These verbs refer to a state of affairs. As there is no action 
involved there cannot be an actor. They thus contrast with di- 
passive verbs which refer to an action. The verbs diletakkan 
‘placed (by someone)’ and ditulis ‘written (by someone)’ refer 
to actions and can hence take an agent, while terletak ‘situated’ 
and tertulis ‘written’ refer to the state which exists following an 
action:
1.265
1.266

 Afﬁ xes 117
Koran siapa yang diletakkan di atas meja?
Whose newspaper has been placed on the table?
Koran siapa yang terletak di atas meja?
Whose newspaper is (located) on the table?
Surat itu ditulis(nya) dalam bahasa Inggris.
That letter was written (by him) in English.
Surat itu tertulis dalam bahasa Inggris.
That letter is written in English.
No other afﬁ x can co-occur with stative ter-; any afﬁ x present 
with the corresponding basic verb is deleted, as with -kan in the 
ﬁ rst example above. Other examples of stative ter- are:
Patung dewa itu terbuat dari emas.
The statue of the god was made from gold.
Pengetahuannya sangat terbatas.
His knowledge is very limited.
Koran ini tertanggal 20 April.
This newspaper is dated 20 April.
All stative ter- verbs correspond to basic passive verbs which 
describe the action from which the state results. Other verbs in 
this group include:
terkenal well-known 
tercatat noted
terputus severed, broken off 
tersebut mentioned
tertutup shut 
terlibat involved
tertarik attracted, interested 
terjamin guaranteed
terbuka open 
tercemar polluted
tersedia available 
terhormat honoured, 
 
  respected
Accidental ter-
The word ‘accidental’ is a cover term for a variety of uncon-
trolled actions and it is not appropriate in all cases; depend-
ing on the particular verb and the context other terms may be 
more appropriate, such as ‘unintended’, ‘unexpected’, ‘agentless’, 
‘involuntary’, ‘sudden’.
Verbs in English do not distinguish between accidental and 
deliberate action. Thus, ‘He left his bag in the library’ may refer 
to a deliberate act or to an unintended act, usually context 
1.267

118 Words
making clear which is meant. In Indonesian the contrast is 
usually made explicit. In the following sentences, ditinggalkan 
‘left’ and dijatuhkan ‘dropped’ refer to deliberate actions while 
tertinggal and terjatuh refer to accidental actions:
Tasnya ditinggalkan di perpustakaan.
His bag was left (deliberately) in the library.
Tasnya tertinggal di perpustakaan.
His bag was left (accidentally) in the library.
Piring dijatuhkan.
The plate was dropped (deliberately).
Piring terjatuh.
The plate was dropped (accidentally)/The plate fell.
Accidental ter- verbs can be either intransitive or transitive.
Intransitive accidental ter- verbs
These verbs behave like basic intransitive verbs except that they 
explicitly state that the subject undergoes something unin-
tended, the action often occurring suddenly and unexpectedly.
Latif tertidur di kelas.
Latif fell asleep in class.
Saya tergelincir di jalan.
I slipped on the road.
Tadi pagi saya terbangun jam lima.
 This morning I woke (suddenly and unintentionally) at ﬁ ve 
o’clock.
Other verbs in this subgroup include:
terdiam fall silent 
terkejut be startled
tertegun stop suddenly 
terbakar catch ﬁ re
terlompat jump suddenly 
terpekik scream suddenly
terjadi happen 
tersandung stumble
Transitive accidental ter- verbs
Transitive accidental verbs are passive. Passive type one 
(see 3.27) always occurs, even if the agent is ﬁ rst or second 
person:
Maaf, buku saudara terbawa oleh saya.
Sorry, I took your book by mistake.
1.268
1.269

 Afﬁ xes 119
Maaf, penamu terpakai oleh saya.
Sorry, I used your pen by mistake.
When the agent is a pronoun, as in the above examples, oleh ‘by’ 
must occur. It can be omitted if the agent is a noun:
Obat itu terminum anak saya.
The medicine was accidentally drunk by my child.
An agent is not necessarily expressed and sometimes the situ-
ation is agentless, or is perceived as such, or the agent is of no 
importance to the event being related:
Waktu tabrakan terjadi sopir terlempar dari taksi.
 When the accident occurred the driver was thrown from the 
taxi.
Dia tersabet dengan senjata tajam.
He was slashed with a sharp weapon.
Tertipulah kamu!
You were tricked!
Sometimes ter- and di- forms can be used together to contrast 
deliberate and accidental action:
Dia ditembak atau tertembak polisi.
He was shot deliberately or accidentally by the police.
Other transitive accidental ter- verbs include:
tertabrak collided with
tepergok caught red-handed
tertangkap caught, arrested
termakan eaten
terluka injured
terbunuh killed
Accidental ter- verbs are not often associated with basic verbs with 
sufﬁ x -i or -kan. When they are, the sufﬁ x usually drops:
Pemain utama itu tersingkir.
The top player was eliminated.
 Penduduk setempat tidak akan terpengaruh oleh rencana 
pemerintah.
 The local population won’t be affected by the government 
plan.
1.270

120 Words
 Kita memang mudah terpesona oleh barang-barang 
mahal.
We are indeed easily enticed by expensive goods.
The ter- verbs in the above three sentences correspond to the 
basic verbs disingkirkan ‘eliminated’, dipengaruhi ‘inﬂ uenced’ 
and dipesonakan ‘enchanted’ respectively.
Sometimes a sufﬁ x occurring on the basic verb is retained 
on the ter- verb, especially in journalistic usage. Dictionar-
ies and grammars differ markedly in what they list and there 
is considerable doubt and disagreement among speakers as to 
whether sufﬁ xes can occur with some verbs. Sometimes a sufﬁ x 
is used by some people but not others. The verb in the following 
example corresponds to the basic verb digenangi:
Tujuh ratus rumah tergenangi/tergenang air.
Seven hundred houses were covered in water.
However, for some speakers a sufﬁ x is always unacceptable with 
accidental ter- verbs. Dropping of sufﬁ xes with accidental ter- 
verbs is further discussed in section 1.274.
The verb teringat ‘remember, recall (suddenly)’ is excep-
tional in a number of ways. It allows a pronoun agent without 
oleh:
Teringatku suatu peristiwa.
I remembered an incident.
It allows either an active clause structure, resembling intransi-
tive ingat akan/pada ‘remember’, or a passive clause structure, 
resembling diingat ‘remembered’:
Saya teringat akan keluarga itu.
Keluarga itu teringat oleh saya.
I suddenly thought of that family.
Abilitative ter- verbs
These verbs indicate that the agent has the ability to perform the 
action. All abilitative constructions are transitive and passive. 
As with accidentals only passive type one structures (see 3.27) 
occur, even with ﬁ rst and second person agents.
1.271
1.272

 Afﬁ xes 121
Abilitative verbs are usually negated, indicating the inability 
of the agent to perform the action:
Mobil semahal itu tidak terbeli oleh saya.
I can’t afford to buy a car as expensive as that.
Masalah itu belum terselesaikan oleh kami.
We haven’t yet been able to settle that matter.
Frequently an agent is not expressed:
Suara dosen tidak terdengar dari sini.
The lecturer can’t be heard from here.
Soal kemacetan lalu lintas belum terpecahkan.
The problem of trafﬁ c congestion cannot yet be solved.
Blok-blok perdagangan regional tak terhindari lagi.
Regional trading blocks can no longer be avoided.
As shown in the above examples, if a basic verb has sufﬁ x -kan 
or -i, this is regularly retained on the corresponding abilitative 
ter- verb (while it is almost always dropped with accidental 
verbs—see 1.270).
Although abilitative ter- verbs are usually negated, this is not 
always the case:
Kini arteri yang buntu terpintasi.
Nowadays blocked arteries can be bypassed.
Lebih dari seratus orang terselamatkan dari feri Estonia.
 More than a hundred people have been saved from the ferry 
Estonia. (literally: ‘… were able to be saved …’)
Apa pekerjaan itu terselesaikan?
Can that work be ﬁ nished?
There is nowadays a tendency for redundant dapat ‘can’ to occur 
if the verb is not negated:
Diharapkan pencemaran limbah pabrik dapat teratasi.
It is hoped pollution by factory waste can be overcome.
Ini semua dapat tercapai berkat kemajuan teknik.
All of this can be achieved thanks to technological progress.
Instead of a ter- verb, a basic di- verb with bisa or dapat ‘can’ 
very frequently occurs to indicate ability:

122 Words
Masalah ini belum dapat dipecahkan.
This problem cannot yet be solved.
Other abilitative ter- verbs (given in the positive) include:
teramalkan can be predicted
terelakkan can be avoided
terkendalikan can be controlled
terlihat visible, can be seen
terpisahkan can be separated
tersingkapkan can be revealed
tertahankan can be endured
A number of negated ter- verbs have English equivalents with 
un-/in-…-able:
tidak terkatakan indescribable
tidak terdengar inaudible
tidak terhindarkan unavoidable
tidak terlihat invisible
tidak terlukiskan indescribable
Potentially ambiguous ter- verbs
Some ter- verbs are potentially ambiguous as to accidental and 
abilitative action, although context usually makes clear which 
meaning is intended. In its ﬁ rst occurrence below terbaca 
indicates ability, which is made clear by tidak pre ceding it 
and also by the explanation karena fonnya terlalu kecil. In its 
second occurrence, accidental action appears from the unde-
sirable circumstance of having one’s (private) email read by 
everyone.
Imelnya tidak terbaca karena fonnya terlalu kecil.
Her emails were unreadable because the font was too small.
Imelnya terbaca oleh umum.
Her email was accidentally read by everyone.
Likewise, in the following two sentences tercuci indicates 
ability in the ﬁ rst instance, as appears from the phrase 
sebanyak itu, and points to accidental action in the second 
instance because of the implausibility of washing a letter other 
than by mistake.
1.273

 Afﬁ xes 123
Apa tercuci olehmu pakaian sebanyak itu?
Did you manage to wash that many clothes?
Suratmu tercuci oleh ibu bersama dengan pakaianmu.
 Mother unintentionally washed your letter along with your 
clothes.16
It is possible for a word to be ambiguous as to all three basic 
functions of ter-, although context makes the intention clear. 
Thus the word terbuka is usually understood as stative as in 
the ﬁ rst example below, although depending on the meaning of 
the sentence it can be accidental, as in the second example, or 
abilitative, as in the third example:
Pintu terbuka.
The door is open.
Matanya terbuka lebar karena keheranan.
His eyes opened wide with amazement.
Akhirnya pintu itu terbuka juga olehnya.
Finally he did manage to open the door.
Retention and loss of sufﬁ xes with ter- verbs
If a basic transitive verb has a sufﬁ x, this is retained with an abili-
tative ter- verb (see 1.272) but usually dropped with an acciden-
tal verb, as discussed in section 1.270. Thus, corresponding to 
dipikirkan ‘thought about’ is terpikir ‘unintentionally thought’ 
and (tidak) terpikirkan ‘can (not) be thought’:
Hal itu belum pernah terpikir olehnya.
That had never entered his mind.
Harapan seperti itu tak terpikirkan oleh ayahnya.
 Such a prospect was unthinkable for her father. (literally: 
‘… could not be thought by her father.’)
Other forms with ter-
There are many ter- verbs which do not ﬁ t easily into any of 
the three categories described in sections 1.266–72. Some verbs 
like tertawa ‘laugh’ and tersenyum ‘smile’ can be grouped with 
intransitive accidentals (see 1.268), indicating action which is 
considered beyond the control of the subject. Some words with 
ter- are not verbs; they belong to other word classes and in many 
cases it is doubtful if the component ter can always be regarded 
1.274
1.275

124 Words
as a preﬁ x in the modern language. Such words include terlalu 
‘too’, terlambat ‘late’, terhadap ‘towards’, terutama ‘especially’, 
termasuk ‘including’.
Verbs with circumﬁ x ke-…-an
With a few exceptions these verbs are adversatives; they indicate 
that the subject undergoes an unpleasant or undesired experi-
ence or event.
Unlike basic verbs, adversative verbs explicitly focus attention 
on the adverse effect of the event on the subject. The following 
two sentences can be translated in the same way:
Mobil Tomo dicuri.
Tomo kecurian mobil.
Tomo’s car was stolen.
However, the ﬁ rst sentence is simply a statement of what 
happened to Tomo’s car, while the second sentence speciﬁ cally 
indicates that Tomo undergoes something unpleasant. It could 
more literally be translated, ‘Tomo suffered the stealing of his 
car’, ‘Tomo had his car stolen’, or ‘Tomo was robbed of his car’.
There is only a limited number of adversative verbs and new 
formations are not common. In colloquial speech numerous 
forms occur with ke-…-an under Javanese inﬂ uence, where 
standard Indonesian has preﬁ x ter-. These are not discussed here. 
The few forms occurring in standard speech which have ter- 
equivalents are, however, discussed in the following sections.
Some six subgroups can be recognised, based on the 
re lationships between the constituents.
Verbs in subgroup 1 derive from basic intransitive verbs in 
clauses whose subject noun phrase contains a head noun and a 
possessor, such as the following:
Uang Tomo hilang.
Tomo’s money is lost.
The possessor of the basic construction—Tomo in the above 
example—becomes subject of the ke-…-an verb and the 
original head noun—uang in the above example—is expressed 
as a complement (see 3.65) following the verb:
1.276
1.277

 Afﬁ xes 125
Tomo kehilangan uang.
 Tomo has lost his money (Tomo has suffered the loss of his 
money).
Other verbs in this group include:
 kehabisan suffer from (complement) being used up, run out 
of (complement)
kematian suffer the death of (complement)
 kekurangan suffer a deﬁ ciency of (complement), lack 
(complement)
Also in this subgroup is keguguran ‘have a miscarriage’ (liter-
ally: ‘suffer the falling’). This verb does not have a complement, 
as it is understood:
Ibu Asma keguguran tadi malam.
Mrs Asma had a miscarriage last night.
Although the complement is always something possessed by the 
subject, possessive -nya is rare but can occur:
Mereka kematian ayah(nya).
They have lost their father.
These verbs must be distinguished from nouns derived from 
similar bases with ke-…-an (see 1.77). These nouns, such as 
kematian ‘death’ in the following example, occur in different 
environments from the verbs:
Kematian ayahnya sangat menyedihkan.
The death of his father was very saddening.
Verbs in subgroup 2 correspond to transitive passive verbs. Like 
verbs described in section 1.277, they have a complement indi-
cating something possessed by the subject. An example with 
kecurian ‘suffer from the theft of (complement)’ is given in 
section 1.276.
Other verbs in this subgroup include:
kecopetan have (complement) stolen by a pickpocket
kemalingan be burgled of (complement)
Unlike verbs in subgroup 1, these verbs can occur without a 
complement:
1.278

126 Words
Saya kecopetan (dompet) di bus.
I was pickpocketed (of my wallet) on the bus.
Subgroup 3 verbs are based on nouns. The subject is adversely 
affected by what the base indicates. In the following sentence, 
the subject is unpleasantly affected by malam ‘night’:
Dia kemalaman di hutan.
He was overtaken by night in the forest.
Other verbs in this group include:
kehujanan be caught in the rain
kesiangan be overtaken by daylight
kegelapan overtaken by the dark
kebanjiran be ﬂ ooded
ketulangan have a bone caught in the throat
keracunan be poisoned
kecanduan be addicted
Some of these verbs also occur in subgroup 5 (see 1.281).
Subgroup 4 verbs are based on adjectives. The subject suffers 
from what the base indicates to a severe degree. The differ-
ence between the adjective alone and the verb derived from it is 
shown in the following examples:
Dia lapar.
He is hungry.
Dia kelaparan.
He is famished/starving.
Other verbs in this group include:
kepanasan suffer from heat, be overcome by heat
kedinginan suffer extremely from cold
kehausan suffer from severe thirst
kesakitan be in pain
kesepian be lonely
ketakutan be terriﬁ ed
These verbs must be distinguished from homophonous nouns 
derived from the same adjectives (see 1.73). Thus ketakutan ‘be 
1.279
1.280

 Afﬁ xes 127
terriﬁ ed’ is homophonous with ketakutan ‘fear’, although they 
have a different distribution in sentences:
Dia ketakutan.
He is terriﬁ ed.
Dia hidup dalam ketakutan.
He lives in fear.
They must also be distinguished from colloquial adjectives 
meaning ‘too [base]’ (see 1.123). Such adjectives have an inani-
mate subject, while the verbs have a human subject:
Kami kedinginan tadi malam.
We were freezing last night.
Air ini kedinginan.
This water is too cold (for me).
Subgroup 5 verbs have the same meaning as correspond-
ing basic verbs with afﬁ xation di-…-i except that the action 
is explicitly adversative, the difference being shown by the 
following:
Bu Hartini didatangi wartawan.
Mrs Hartini was visited by a journalist.
Bu Hartini kedatangan wartawan.
Mrs Hartini was unexpectedly visited by a journalist.
With verbs in this subgroup the noun following the verb is the 
agent. If it is perceived as the human instigator of the action, 
the actor (see 3.17), then it can be preceded by oleh ‘by’, as 
in the ﬁ rst example below. If, however, it is inanimate, as in 
the second example below, the use of oleh is unacceptable to 
many people:
Dia ketahuan (oleh) ayahnya.
He was found out by his father.
Dia kejatuhan durian.
He was hit by a falling durian fruit.
Other verbs in this subgroup include:
kedapatan be discovered, caught in the act
kemasukan be possessed, inﬁ ltrated
ketularan be infected, contaminated
1.281

128 Words
ketumbuhan be overgrown with
ketumpahan be spilled on
The verbs ketahuan and kedapatan allow a verbal complement 
(see 3.72):
Dia kedapatan menggelapkan uang negara.
He was caught embezzling state funds.
 Pemilik toko itu ketahuan oleh polisi menjual burung-
burung kookaburra.
 The shop owner was caught by the police selling kookaburras.
A few verbs in subgroup 3 (see 1.279) can also occur in sub - 
group 5. As subgroup 3 verbs they are based on nouns and do 
not have an agent, while as subgroup 5 verbs they correspond 
to di-…-i verbs and can have an agent. In the ﬁ rst sentence 
below kebanjiran is based on the noun banjir ‘ﬂ ood’ and 
means ‘subjected to ﬂ ood (banjir)’, while in the second sentence 
it corresponds to dibanjiri ‘be ﬂ ooded’ and occurs with an 
agent:
Kota itu kebanjiran.
The town was ﬂ ooded.
Kota itu kebanjiran (oleh) turis asing.
The town was ﬂ ooded with foreign tourists.
Some other subgroup 5 verbs which also occur in subgroup 3 
are given here with exemplary agents and corresponding basic 
verbs:
 keracunan (permen basi) be poisoned (by spoiled sweets) 
(diracuni poisoned)
 kehujanan (batu) be rained on (by stones) (dihujani rained 
on)
Subgroup 6 includes several verbs whose subject is not the 
person adversely affected but the thing possessed by that person. 
In this respect they resemble ter- verbs (see 1.269). In the follow-
ing sentence the person adversely affected by kebongkaran ‘be 
broken into’ is saya ‘I’, the possessor of the house:
Rumah saya kebongkaran.
My house was broken into.
1.282

 Afﬁ xes 129
The ‘ter-like’ character of these verbs is seen with kebakar an 
‘catch ﬁ re, be burned’ which has the same meaning as 
terbakar:
Kapal itu kebakaran/terbakar.
The ship caught ﬁ re.
With ketinggalan ‘be left behind’ a person can be subject only if 
he or she is the ‘thing’ left behind:
Saya ketinggalan bis.
I missed the bus. (literally: ‘I was left behind by the bus.’)
Two ke-…-an verbs are not adversative. These are keli hatan ‘can 
be seen, visible; looks, seems’ and kedengaran ‘can be heard, 
audible; sounds, seems’:
Rumahnya tidak kelihatan dari sini.
His house can’t be seen from here.
Musik itu kedengaran dari jalan.
The music can be heard from the road.
Meaning ‘can be seen/heard’, these verbs function like passive 
verbs and can take an agent. If the agent is a pronoun, occur-
rence of oleh ‘by’ is obligatory (see 3.32):
Musik itu kedengaran olehku.
I could hear the music.
These verbs can have a verbal complement (see example in section 
3.76).
If the verb means ‘seems (looks/sounds)’, it cannot take an 
agent (being intransitive in this function); it can have an adjec-
tival complement (see 3.69) and can take -nya:
Supomo kelihatan(nya) sakit.
Supomo looks sick.
Acting like kelihatan are the afﬁ xless verbs nampak and tampak 
‘can be seen, visible’ (with -nya these mean ‘seems, looks’ and 
function as sentence adjuncts—see 4.107):
Umi tampak/nampak olehku duduk di belakang.
I could see Umi sitting in the back.

Verbs with preﬁ x ke-
There are only a few verbs occurring with preﬁ x ke-. The preﬁ x 
is a borrowing from Javanese and all these verbs are regarded as 
non-standard to some degree by many people.17 Almost all ke- 
verbs correspond to ter- accidental verbs. A very few, includ-
ing the ﬁ rst two listed below, correspond to other forms. More 
standard forms having the same meaning as ke- verbs are given 
in parentheses for the following examples:
ketemu (bertemu) meet
ketimbang (dibandingkan dengan) compared with
ketawa (tertawa) laugh
kesohor (tersohor) famous
ketipu (tertipu) tricked
ketabrak (tertabrak) collided with
kesasar (tersasar) lost, astray
kepergok (tepergok) caught red-handed

2 PHRASES
This chapter describes phrases and other constructions 
which combine to form clauses (clauses are described in 
Chapter 3). A phrase is a group of words which is grammat-
ically equivalent to a single word, being able to occur in the 
same places as that word. The phrase contains a word of the 
class to which it is equivalent. This word is the head or head 
word of the phrase, the rest of the phrase being built around it. 
The phrase type is identiﬁ ed by the word class of its head. Thus 
a noun phrase contains a noun, an adjective phrase contains an 
adjective, and so on.
NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES
A noun phrase is a sequence of words which functions in the 
same way as a noun; that is, it occurs in the same positions in a 
clause as a single noun. A noun phrase always contains a noun 
as its head. Nouns are discussed in section 2.3. The other major 
components of noun phrases are discussed in sections 2.5–60. 
Some other components of noun phrases are described else-
where. A noun occurring alone can be regarded as a (minimal) 
noun phrase (see 2.4).

Nouns
A noun can be deﬁ ned as a word which refers to a person, thing or 
abstract idea. A number of types of noun can be distinguished.
The speciﬁ c name of a person, thing or place is called a proper 
noun. Proper nouns are spelled with a capital letter: Hadi, Jakarta, 
Kalimantan, Kompas. Titles before proper nouns are also treated 
as part of the proper noun: Dokter Rina, Professor Subrata, 
Ibu Kawilarang. Names of organisations, institutions, events 
and countries are also proper nouns: Bank Bumi Daya, Bandara 
Sukarno-Hatta, Idul Fitri, Australia.
A common noun refers to a person or thing which is a 
member of a set; it is not the speciﬁ c name of that person or 
thing: kucing ‘cat’, pikiran ‘thought’, pulau ‘island’, orang 
‘person’, penyakit ‘illness’. A common noun can occur as a 
proper noun when it is part of a speciﬁ c name; thus univer-
sitas ‘university’ is a common noun except when it is part of 
the name of a speciﬁ c university, as in Universitas Indonesia 
‘University of Indonesia’.
Common nouns can be further divided into count nouns 
and non-count (mass) nouns.
Count nouns refer to things which can be counted: buku 
‘book’, rumah ‘house’, pendapat ‘opinion’. These can be directly 
preceded by a number (see 2.14) or a classiﬁ er (see 2.21): dua 
buku ‘two books’, sebuah rumah ‘a house’. They can also be 
reduplicated to indicate plurality (see 1.14): buku-buku ‘books’, 
pendapat-pendapat ‘opinions’.
Non-count nouns cannot be preceded by a number or classi-
ﬁ er or be reduplicated to indicate plurality. They refer to processes, 
substances and the like (either concrete or abstract), rather than 
individual items: air ‘water’, gula ‘sugar’, nasi ‘rice’, hujan ‘rain’, 
keadilan ‘justice’. Although not countable, concrete non-count 
nouns can be preceded by certain quantiﬁ ers (see 2.27ff): sekilo 
gula ‘a kilo of sugar’, dua piring nasi ‘two plates of rice’.
Some non-count nouns can be used as count nouns when 
the context makes it clear that a certain measure or amount is 
being referred to. Thus kopi ‘coffee’ is a non-count noun but if, 
in a restaurant for instance, one asks for dua kopi ‘two coffees’, 
it is clear that what one means is dua cangkir/gelas kopi ‘two 
cups/glasses of coffee’.
2.3

Nouns and noun phrases 133
A noun can occur alone in a phrase, in which case the phrase 
consists solely of its head word. The following construction, a 
clause, consists of two noun phrases, one the subject and one 
the predicate, each phrase consisting of a single noun:
Ali guru.
Ali is a teacher.
Noun phrases
Nouns act as heads of a great variety of different phrase struc-
tures. Some of the important components of noun phrases 
are discussed in the following sections. Not all nouns can 
occur with all the phrase elements discussed; some subclasses 
of noun are restricted in the elements with which they can 
co-occur.
Demonstratives
The demonstratives are ini ‘this’, itu ‘that’, tersebut ‘already 
mentioned’ and tadi ‘recently mentioned’.
The demonstratives ini ‘this’ and itu ‘that’ follow the head noun. 
As they do not distinguish between one and more than one, 
they also translate ‘these’ and ‘those’ respectively:
buku ini this book
kedua buku ini these two books
negeri itu that country
negeri-negeri itu those countries
Demonstratives can occur with all classes of nouns, including 
proper nouns:
Makassar ini this (city of) Makassar
Siti itu that (girl) Siti
Both ini and itu can refer to someone or something previously 
mentioned but not now present:
Bagaimana rumah itu?
What is that house (about which we have been talking) like?
Orang ini baik sekali.
This person (who we are talking about) is very good.

134 Phrases
They can also refer to something physically present, as when 
pointing:
Saya tinggal di rumah ini.
I live in this house.
Duduk di kursi itu.
Sit in that chair.
When referring to something present, but not when referring to 
something previously mentioned but not now present, ini and 
itu can optionally be preceded by yang for emphasis:
 Rumah besar itu rumah Tomo; saya tinggal di rumah yang 
ini.
That big house is Tomo’s; I live in this house.
Tulis di buku yang itu; ini buku saya.
Write in that book; this book is mine.
Besides referring to something being pointed at or something 
previously mentioned, itu can also be used with generic nouns:
Harimau itu binatang liar.
The tiger is a wild animal.
In the above sentence harimau itu, like the English ‘the tiger’, 
refers to all members of the group. Likewise, itu can be used 
with certain nominalised verbal clauses (see 3.143), referring to 
all instances of the action:
Lari itu sehat.
Running is healthy.
The use of itu sometimes proves a difﬁ culty for many English 
speakers, sometimes inaccurately being equated with ‘the’. While 
both words refer to something deﬁ nite, a number of differences 
occur in their usage. In English ‘the’ is obligatory with a noun 
which refers to something unique, whereas itu cannot occur in 
this context:
matahari the sun
bulan the moon
Many nouns refer to something which is unique to one context 
but may not be unique in other contexts. Thus perdana menteri 
2.8

Nouns and noun phrases 135
‘prime minister’ refers to someone unique in the discussion 
of a particular country but not in a discussion referring to a 
number of countries. Where it is unique, as in the ﬁ rst sentence 
below, itu cannot occur; where it is not unique, as in the second 
sentence, itu can occur:
Perdana menteri sudah pulang.
The Prime Minister has returned home.
Kedua perdana menteri itu bersalaman.
The two prime ministers greeted each other.
In English ‘the’ can refer to something not previously men-
tioned, whereas itu cannot. This matter is further discussed in 
section 2.50.
When a non-unique noun has previously been mentioned, it 
is usually marked by itu if there is nothing else in the phrase to 
indicate that it refers back to what has already been mentioned. 
Thus in Orang itu teman saya ‘That person is my friend’, orang 
‘person’ cannot occur alone because there is nothing to tell that 
it refers to someone already mentioned or being pointed to; 
only itu marks it as deﬁ nite, and therefore already mentioned. 
If something else marks the noun as deﬁ nite, itu need not occur 
(see, for instance, 3.98).
In formal writing tersebut ‘previously mentioned’ is sometimes 
used to refer to someone or something already mentioned:
Alasan itu dikemukakan oleh para guru bahasa tersebut.
 That reason was put forward by the previously mentioned 
language teachers.
Although tadi ‘just recently’ usually occurs as an adjunct of 
time (see 2.191), it can follow a noun to refer back to someone 
or something recently mentioned or recently present:
Kedua kekasih tadi sekarang sudah menjadi suami istri.
 The two lovers (who were mentioned a short while ago) have 
now become husband and wife.
Anaknya mengintip adegan seram tadi.
His child spied the frightening scene (just referred to).

136 Phrases
Bagaimana pendapat saudara tentang orang tadi?

ago)?
Quantiﬁ ers
There are several types of quantiﬁ er, including deﬁ nite and 
indeﬁ nite numbers. Partitives, which indicate amount, combine 
with numbers to form quantiﬁ ers. Classiﬁ ers are not themselves 
quantiﬁ ers. However, as they behave in some ways similar to 
partitives and must occur with a number, they are included in 
this section.
Numbers
Numbers are either deﬁ nite or indeﬁ nite. Deﬁ nite numbers 
include cardinal and ordinal numbers, and fractions. In 
sections 2.14–20 numbers as a component of noun phrases are 
discussed. The internal structure of number phrases is discussed 
in sections 2.106–17.
A cardinal number precedes a count noun (see 2.3) to indicate 
the number of things being referred to:
dua orang two people  
sepuluh kota ten towns
Cardinal numbers are listed in section 2.107.
A cardinal number can occur after a noun to indicate its position 
in a series. Cardinal numbers are only used in this way with 
things which are commonly distinguished from each other by 
their position within a sequence. A question as to the position 
of the noun in the sequence is asked by placing berapa after 
the noun (see 4.19). The contrast between occurrence of cardi-
nals before and after the head noun is shown in the following 
examples:
lima jam ﬁ ve hours 
jam lima ﬁ ve o’clock
tiga halaman three pages 
halaman tiga page three
dua kelas two classes 
kelas dua class two
With dates cardinals are used rather than ordinals:
Mereka akan tiba pada tanggal enam Maret.
They will arrive on the sixth of March.
2.12
2.13
2.14
2.15

Nouns and noun phrases 137
Cardinals also follow the word nomor ‘number’ to indicate a 
number in a series:
Jalan Persahabatan nomor tujuh
number seven Persahabatan Street
bis nomor 14
bus number 14
With nouns which are not usually distinguished by their order 
in a sequence, cardinal numbers cannot be used as described 
in section 2.15; instead, ordinal numbers (see 1.151) are used. 
These follow the head noun:
orang ketiga the third person
minggu keenam the sixth week
Frequently yang precedes the ordinal:
Ali anaknya yang kedua.
Ali is his second child.
Ordinal numbers from kedua upwards can also occur before 
the noun as collective numbers to indicate an inclusive group of 
that many, ‘both’, ‘all three’ and so on. Since the noun they refer 
to is always deﬁ nite it is always marked by a demonstrative, a 
possessive or some other element which identiﬁ es it:
Saya sudah membaca keempat buku itu.
I’ve read those four books.
Kelima anaknya pandai.
All ﬁ ve of her children are clever.
When a speciﬁ c group is not referred to, the collective number 
is replaced by a cardinal number.
Saya sudah membaca empat buku minggu ini.
I’ve read four books this week.
Fractions (see 1.149) precede the noun and indicate how large a 
part of something is compared to the whole:
Dua pertiga orang Indonesia tinggal di pulau Jawa.
Two-thirds of Indonesians live in Java.
Fractions can also be included in full numbers (see 2.108).
2.16
2.17
2.18

138 Phrases
Indeﬁ nite numbers (see 2.113–17) include words like 
banyak ‘many’ and semua ‘all’. Indeﬁ nite numbers precede the 
noun:
Semua orang itu bekerja di kota.
All those people work in town.
The plural marker para is a kind of indeﬁ nite number, discussed 
in section 2.116.
The word dari ‘of’ sometimes separates a number from the 
following head noun.
If a cardinal number is separated from the noun by dari, it 
refers to the number within the group speciﬁ ed by the noun:
Tiga dari orang itu bekerja di rumah sakit.
Three of those people work in the hospital.
Dari optionally occurs between a fraction and the head noun:
Seperlima dari mahasiswa itu naik bis ke kampus.
One-ﬁ fth of those students get the bus to campus.
A few indeﬁ nite numbers are commonly separated from the 
head by dari, including sebagian ‘a number (of)’ and salah 
satu/seorang ‘one (of)’:
salah satu/seorang dari teman saya
one of my friends
 Sebagian dari transmigran itu sudah tahu tentang 
persa wahan.
 A number of the transmigrants know about wet rice 
cultivation.
Classiﬁ ers
A classiﬁ er precedes a count noun to place it in a particular noun 
class. Classiﬁ ers are optional (this is further discussed in 2.27) 
and with many nouns they rarely occur. The classiﬁ ers are always 
preceded by a number. The number plus classiﬁ er can also follow 
the noun, as discussed in section 2.31. If the noun is singular, 
se- ‘one’ precedes the classiﬁ er. Only three classiﬁ ers are in frequent 
use:
2.19
2.20
2.21

Nouns and noun phrases 139
orang used with humans 
seorang guru a teacher
ekor used with living 
dua ekor ular/ikan/kucing 
  creatures  
  two snakes/ﬁ sh/cats
buah used with inanimate 
tiga buah meja/pena/rumah 
  things  
  three tables/pens/houses
Classiﬁ ers are far more likely to occur with se-, meaning ‘one’ 
but translated ‘a, an’, than with higher numbers. If the classiﬁ er 
is absent, se- cannot occur:
Dia seorang guru/Dia guru.
He is a teacher.
With a classiﬁ er the noun is always indeﬁ nite. That is, it does 
not refer to a speciﬁ c thing or things; hence a demonstrative or 
possessor cannot co-occur with a classiﬁ er:
seorang guru 
cf. 
guru saya/itu
a teacher 
 
my/that teacher
dua ekor kuda 
cf. 
kedua kuda itu
two horses 
 
those two horses
In journalistic style classiﬁ ers occasionally occur with a proper 
noun, just as ‘a’ can in English:
 Sebuah Indonesia yang kuat dan dinamis penting untuk 
Asia Tenggara.
 A strong and dynamic Indonesia is important for Southeast 
Asia.
Generic nouns, such as ikan ‘ﬁ sh’ and burung ‘bird’, can take a 
modifying noun (see 2.37) and be preceded by a classiﬁ er:
seekor ikan hiu a shark
seekor burung elang a hawk
The three classiﬁ ers discussed in section 2.21 are still relatively 
common. There are a large number of other classiﬁ ers which 
are still in use but are becoming obsolete. The following list is 
not exhaustive. There is some overlap in function; for instance, 
helai, lembar and carik can all occur with kertas ‘paper’, and 
biji and butir sometimes overlap:
batang used with cylindrical objects such as pipes, tree 
trunks, cigarettes: Pak Trimo memiliki 25 batang pohon 
kelapa. Mr Trimo owns 25 coconut trees.
2.22

140 Phrases
bentuk used with round and curved objects: sebentuk 
cincin/gelang a ring/bangle
bidang used with ﬂ at, spread-out things: sebidang tanah a 
plot of land
biji used with round or elongated objects such as fruits and 
seeds: dua biji mangga two mangoes, sebiji telur rebus 
one boiled egg, tiga biji ketimun three cucumbers
bilah used with sharp things such as knives, needles: Nanda 
mengancam sopir dengan sebilah pisau. Nanda threat-
ened the driver with a knife.
butir used with small, round or elongated objects, grains, 
pellets: dua butir telur two eggs, sebutir pasir a grain of 
sand, sebutir pil a pill
carik used with paper: secarik kertas a piece of paper
helai used with ﬂ at things like leaves, textiles, paper: sehelai 
kertas a sheet of paper, sehelai daun a leaf
kaki used with umbrellas: sekaki payung an umbrella
kuntum used with ﬂ owers: tiga kuntum bunga kemboja 
three frangipannis
lembar used with ﬂ at things such as leaves, textiles, paper: 
dua lembar foto two photographs, selembar kertas a 
sheet of paper
patah used with kata ‘word’: sepatah dua patah kata a word 
or two, one or two words
pucuk used with guns and letters: sepucuk surat/bedil a 
letter/gun
tangkai used with slender objects, such as stems and tool 
handles: setangkai dahlia a dahlia, setangkai pena a pen
utas used with rope and thread: Dia mengikatkan seutas 
tali pada tiang. He tied a piece of rope to the pole.
With nouns which do not ﬁ t any of the above categories buah 
generally occurs. As the classiﬁ ers listed above are rarely used, 
buah can replace some of them. Alternatively, a classiﬁ er is 
omitted, indicated by parentheses in the following examples:
Tadi pagi saya menulis tiga (pucuk/buah) surat.
This morning I wrote three letters.
Tangannya memegang (sepucuk/sebuah) pistol.
His hand clutched a pistol.
2.23

Nouns and noun phrases 141
Classiﬁ ers are also used with abstract nouns: sebuah rencana ‘a 
plan’, sebuah perdebatan ‘a debate’, sebutir pikiran ‘a thought, 
idea, concept’, sebutir pernyataan politik ‘a political statement’, 
sekuntum rindu ‘a longing’, sekuntum senyum ‘a smile’, secarik 
kisah kehidupan ‘a life story’.
The function of sebuah overlaps with that of suatu ‘a’, 
discussed in section 2.114.
Classiﬁ ers can be preceded by some indeﬁ nite numbers, includ-
ing beberapa ‘several’, and the interrogative number berapa 
‘how many?’ (see 4.19):
beberapa buah buku several books
berapa biji sabun? how many cakes of soap?
Unlike other classiﬁ ers, orang can occur without a following 
head noun:
Dia seorang yang jujur.
He is an honest person.
If se- does not occur in such situations, orang must be regarded 
simply as the noun meaning ‘person’:
Dia orang yang jujur.
He’s an honest person.
The classiﬁ er orang and the head noun orang are sometimes 
used together, although many speakers avoid this construction:
Seorang orang Perancis diculik di Kamboja kemarin.
A Frenchman was abducted in Cambodia yesterday.
The word belah ‘half; one of something which comes in a pair’ 
is sometimes listed with classiﬁ ers. It is used mainly with body 
parts which are in pairs: sebelah mata ‘an eye’, dua belah tangan 
‘two/both hands’ and for things like shoes and ornaments worn 
one on each side of the body: sebelah subang ‘one earring’. 
Unlike classiﬁ ers it can occur with a deﬁ nite noun, marked, for 
instance, by a possessive:
Dia menutup mulutnya dengan kedua belah tangannya.
She covered her mouth with both hands.
2.24

2.26

142 Phrases
Partitives
Partitives indicate a particular amount of something. They 
precede the head word, which can be either a count or a non-
count noun. Count nouns can alternatively be preceded by a 
cardinal number or a number plus classiﬁ er but non-count nouns 
cannot. To indicate singular, se- ‘one’ precedes the partitive. In 
some discussions of Indonesian grammar partitives are confused 
with classiﬁ ers. However, there is a clear distinction: classiﬁ ers 
group nouns on the basis of some perceived intrinsic charac-
teristic, while partitives group nouns on the basis of how they 
are measured, assembled or processed. Thus, in sebatang rokok 
‘a cigarette’, batang is a classiﬁ er, marking rokok ‘cigarette’ as a 
member of the class of cylindrical objects. In sebungkus rokok 
‘a packet of cigarettes’, bungkus is a partitive, identifying the 
quantity of cigarettes according to the way they are packaged.
Unlike classiﬁ ers, which are always optional, partitives can 
never be deleted without change of meaning. Thus, deletion 
of batang in the following sentence results in no change in 
meaning:
Dia menghabiskan dua batang rokok.
Dia menghabiskan dua rokok.
He smoked two cigarettes.
On the other hand, deletion of the partitive bungkus results in 
a sentence with a different meaning:
Dia menghabiskan dua bungkus rokok.
He smoked two packets of cigarettes.
Dia menghabiskan dua rokok.
He smoked two cigarettes.
The number preceding a partitive can be a fraction; in the 
following example, setengah ‘half’ precedes the partitive gelas 
‘glass (of)’:
Dia minum setengah gelas air.
He drank half a glass of water.
Among partitives are containers; any noun indicating some-
thing which can contain something else can be used in this 
way:
2.27
2.28

Nouns and noun phrases 143
bakul basket 
tiga bakul beras three baskets 
of rice
botol bottle 
sebotol bir a bottle of beer
genggam handful 
beberapa genggam nasi several 
handfuls of rice
karung sack 
lima karung beras ﬁ ve sacks of 
rice
piring plate 
sepiring nasi a plate of rice
sendok spoon 
dua sendok gula two spoons of 
sugar
truk truck 
dua truk pasir two truckloads 
of sand
Partitives include natural and artiﬁ cial clusterings, groupings 
and pieces of things, such as:
bulir ear 
sebulir padi an ear of rice
gugus cluster 
segugus bintang a cluster of 
stars
gumpal clump, lump 
segumpal tanah a clump of soil
iris slice 
dua iris mangga two slices of 
mango
jenis kind, sort, species 
sejenis burung a type/species

kawan herd, ﬂ ock, gang 
sekawan gajah a herd of

keping chip, fragment 
sekeping kayu a splinter of 
wood
macam kind, sort, type 
semacam senjata a type of 
weapon
potong piece, slice 
sepotong roti a slice of bread
rombongan group, party 
serombongan gubernur a 
group of governors
sikat hand, small bunch 
dua sikat pisang two hands of 
bananas
tandan bunch 
setandan pisang a bunch of 
bananas
tetes drop 
setetes darah a drop of blood
timbun pile 
lima timbun pasir ﬁ ve piles of 
sand
2.29

144 Phrases
With some members of this subgroup the partitive plus head 
noun may be reinterpreted as head noun plus modifying noun 
(see 2.37). In the above list tandan ‘bunch’ is a partitive, while in 
the following sentence it is the head of a noun phrase, occurring 
reduplicated and without a number, as can other count nouns:
Dia sedang menata tandan-tandan pisang dagangannya.
She was arranging the banana bunches she had for sale.
Some other partitives in this group more commonly take sufﬁ x 
-an if occurring as phrase heads (see 1.65).
Measurement nouns can act as partitives. A measurement 
noun refers to size, distance, volume, speed, weight or temp-
erature:
meter metre 
ton tonne
kilometer kilometre 
hektar hectare
liter litre 
derajat degree
depa fathom, measure from ﬁ ngertip to ﬁ ngertip
hasta cubit, measure from elbow to ﬁ ngertip
Measurement nouns are always preceded by a number, forming 
measurement noun phrases:
dua kilometer two kilometres
tiga seperempat ton three and a quarter tonnes
 dua puluh delapan derajat (selsius) twenty-eight degrees 
(Celsius)
beberapa liter several litres
Measurement nouns referring to length, area, volume and weight 
can occur in partitive constructions to indicate the amount of 
something:
sekilo beras a kilo of rice
dua liter susu two litres of milk
 tiga puluh ribu hektar lahan thirty thousand hectares 
of land
setengah meter rotan half a metre of cane
dua kodi kain two kodi (= forty pieces) of cloth
2.30

Nouns and noun phrases 145
Numbers, classiﬁ ers and partitives—further comments
Both classiﬁ ers and partitives can follow the head noun:
Dia mengimpor kursi sebanyak 8000 buah.
He imported as many as 8000 chairs.
Dia datang membawa susu dua gelas.
She came with two glasses of milk.
Ibu membeli beras dua kilo.
Mother bought two kilos of rice.
Many classiﬁ ers and partitives are basically nouns and can 
occur as heads of noun phrases. Words functioning as classi-
ﬁ ers sometimes have a different meaning when functioning as 
a head noun. Thus the classiﬁ ers ekor, grouping animals, and 
buah, grouping inanimate things, mean ‘tail’ and ‘fruit’ respec-
tively when occurring as nouns:
Ekor anjing ini panjang.
This dog’s tail is long.
Buah pohon ini enak.
The fruit of this tree is delicious.
All partitives indicating containers (see 2.28) also occur as full 
nouns:
Botol ini retak.
This bottle is cracked.
Group numbers and some partitives, including those indicating 
containers (see 2.28), and measurement nouns (see 2.30) can 
be reduplicated and preﬁ xed with ber- to indicate an indeﬁ nite 
quantity (see also 1.161 and 1.162 for further examples):
berjuta-juta orang millions of people
berliter-liter susu litres and litres of milk
berbotol-botol bir bottles and bottles of beer
bermacam-macam tanaman all sorts of plants
Diminutives and honoriﬁ cs
These occur immediately before the head noun to convey 
an attitude on the part of the speaker, usually of affection or 
respect.

2.32

2.34

146 Phrases
Si
This is a diminutive. It is used with the names of children, 
emphasising their smallness or a feeling of affection on the part 
of the speaker:
si Ali Ali (a child)
Si can also be used with the names of animals, especially pets or 
animals in folk stories. In this case it is a personiﬁ er as well as 
diminutive:
si Putih Whitey (name of a pet)
si Kancil Mousedeer (character in folk stories)
It can occur with adjectives, usually those indicating physical 
characteristics, turning the adjective into a proper noun while 
still acting as a diminutive:
si Botak Baldy 
si Gemuk Fatty
si Tolol Dopey
The nominalised adjective may become a common noun, in 
which case the diminutive sense is usually absent:
 Pembagian pangan yang tak merata membuat si gendut 
makin kaya, tanpa peduli nasib si miskin, yang hampir 
mati kelaparan.
 Unequal distribution of food makes the fat one increasingly 
rich, without caring about the fate of the poor one, who 
almost dies of hunger.
It also occurs with common nouns, most frequently those 
formed with peN- (see 1.46). Here there is no diminutive 
connotation:
si pembawa resep
the one who brought the prescription
Si pengirim foto tidak menyebutkan namanya.
The sender of the photos didn’t mention his name.
Sang
This is an honoriﬁ c. It shows that the person referred to is 
someone held in high respect:
sang Raja the King
sang Presiden the President

Like si, it can occur with names of animals in folk tales. It also 
occurs before the name of the Indonesian ﬂ ag, thus acting as a 
personiﬁ er as well as retaining its role as an honoriﬁ c:
sang Harimau Tiger
sang Merah Putih the Red and White (the Indonesian ﬂ ag)
It can also be used facetiously or even sarcastically to indicate 
the speaker’s negative attitude towards someone who is perhaps 
more highly regarded than he deserves:
 Sekitar tiga puluh tahun silam nama John Profumo melam-
bung di media massa karena sang menteri terlibat skandal 
seks dengan seorang pelacur.
 About thirty years ago the name of John Profumo was 
prominent in the media because the esteemed minister was 
involved in a sex scandal with a prostitute.
Modifying nouns
A noun can be followed by another noun called a modifying 
noun. A modifying noun gives more speciﬁ c information about 
the head noun. There is a wide range of relationships between 
the two nouns. The modifying noun can indicate what the head 
noun is made of, where it comes from, what it is used for, what 
it does, where it is, what it is part of, what sex it is, what process 
it has undergone and so on. The following examples illustrate a 
number of these relationships:
toko buku bookshop
guru bahasa language teacher
sate ayam chicken satay
buku sejarah history book
pemain tenis tennis player
ilmu kedokteran medical science
mesin pendingin cooling machine
tukang kayu carpenter (wood artisan)
buku catatan notebook
anak perempuan girl (female child)
orang Jepang Japanese (person)
kapal Indonesia Indonesian ship
kain batik batik cloth
pinggir jalan edge of the road
2.37

148 Phrases
Some modifying relationships occur only with action nouns; 
these are discussed in section 2.53.
No other word can come between a head word and following 
modifying noun. Any word following the modifying noun refers 
to the head word and not to the modifying noun:
toko buku yang besar a big bookshop
guru sekolah itu that schoolteacher
An exception is that some modifying nouns can themselves take 
a modiﬁ er. In the ﬁ rst example below, the head of the noun 
phrase is awak ‘crew’. The modifying noun bis ‘bus’ has its own 
modifying noun, kota ‘city’:
awak bis kota city bus crew
buku sejarah Indonesia Indonesian history book
gelombang keresahan sosial a wave of social unrest
In some cases the modifying noun must itself be modiﬁ ed; that 
is, the phrase would be incomplete if consisting just of the head 
word and modiﬁ er. In such cases, the modiﬁ er is a peN- noun 
based on a transitive verb (see 1.46) and its own modiﬁ er relates 
to the object of the corresponding verb. 
The ﬁ rst example below relates to Pasukan itu memelihara 
perdamaian ‘Those troops keep the peace’; pasukan pemeli-
hara is not well-formed unless pemelihara ‘keeper, maintainer’ 
has the modiﬁ er perdamaian ‘peace’. The modiﬁ er and its own 
modiﬁ er act as a compound and are hyphenated in English 
equivalents:
pasukan pemelihara perdamaian peace-keeping forces
propinsi penghasil lada pepper-producing province
kapal pembawa plutonium plutonium-carrying ship
kunjungan pencari fakta fact-ﬁ nding visit
Possessors
A possessor follows the head word. It can be a noun or a 
pronoun:
rumah Tomo Tomo’s house
nama negeri itu the name of that country
mobil saya my car
2.38
2.39
2.40

Nouns and noun phrases 149
Possessive pronouns are further discussed in section 2.72. 
Possessive nouns differ from modifying nouns (see 2.37ff) in 
that they can themselves be the head of a noun phrase. In the 
following example the possessor, toko ‘shop’, is head of a noun 
phrase which contains a modiﬁ er and demonstrative:
nama toko buku itu the name of that bookshop
As head of a noun phrase a possessive noun can also take a 
possessor:
kantor ayah saya my father’s ofﬁ ce
mobil teman Marni Marni’s friend’s car
Out of context ambiguity may exist as to whether a noun is 
modifying or possessive. Thus bis ‘bus’ is a modiﬁ er in the 
ﬁ rst example below, describing what kind of driver Ali is, but 
possessor in the second:
Ali sopir bis.
Ali is a bus driver.
Sopir bis ini belum muncul.
The driver of this bus hasn’t turned up yet.
A possessive noun does not always identify the owner of the 
head word; it may identify the originator, creator or some 
other relationship. In the following phrase, sastrawan ‘man 
of letters’ is the writer of the novel, a relationship sometimes 
indicated by ‘by’ in English:
roman sastrawan ini the novel of/by this man of letters
Sometimes a possessor is optionally preceded by a modify-
ing noun (see 2.37) which speciﬁ es the particular relationship 
between the possessor and head word. The modiﬁ er is not oblig-
atory to the construction. Thus, in buku ciptaan Pak Salim the 
modiﬁ er ciptaan ‘creation’ speciﬁ es that Pak Salim ‘Mr Salim’ 
is the writer of the book rather than the owner. However, the 
modiﬁ er could be omitted, resulting in buku Pak Salim ‘Mr 
Salim’s book’, although this does not explicitly state whether he 
is writer or owner:
buku ciptaan Pak Salim
Mr Salim’s book; the book written by Mr Salim
2.41
2.42

150 Phrases
kios milik Pak Yunus
Mr Yunus’ kiosk; the kiosk owned by Mr Yunus
barang buatan Jepang
Japanese goods; goods made in Japan
partai pimpinan Hawke
Hawke’s party; the party led by Hawke
A ligature dari ‘of’ sometimes occurs between head and 
possessive noun, although it cannot occur before a possessive 
pronoun:
rumah dari Bu Siti Mrs Siti’s house
Use of dari before a possessor is regarded as substandard by 
many people. However, it is frequently used if the head word 
and possessor are the same or similar:
guru dari guru saya
my teacher’scher
lukisan dari pelukis-pelukis Italia
paintings by Italian artists
Also occurring as a ligature before possessive nouns is -nya:
anaknya guru kami our teacher’s child
In this context, -nya carries no meaning other than to identify 
the second noun as possessor. Its use is particularly common 
among speakers of Javanese, in which a similar construction 
occurs. It is likely to occur where a kin relationship would be 
ambiguous. Thus Ibu Suparjo could mean ‘Suparjo’s mother’ or 
‘Mrs Suparjo’. With ligature -nya possession is the only possible 
meaning:
ibunya Suparjo Suparjo’s mother
Adjectives in the noun phrase
An adjective immediately follows the phrase head:
rumah besar a big house
Adjectives are frequently preceded by yang. The yang plus 
adjective construction is actually an instance of a relative clause 
2.43
2.44
2.45

Nouns and noun phrases 151
(see 3.98). However, because of its frequency it deserves separate 
treatment here.
A noun plus adjective sequence forms a close unit, express-
ing a single idea without any emphasis on the adjective. Use of 
yang separates the adjective from the noun and gives emphasis 
to it. This occurs, for instance, when a contrast is made:
 Mereka tinggal di rumah yang besar, bukan rumah yang 
kecil.
They live in a big house, not a small house.
If a noun plus adjective sequence is a compound (see 1.32), 
yang cannot occur:
rumah sakit hospital (literally: ‘sick house’)
imigran gelap illegal immigrant (literally: ‘dark immigrant’)
Some noun plus adjective sequences are either compounds, 
with idiomatic meaning, or genuine sequences, depending on 
context. The combination can only be separated by yang if it is 
not a compound. Thus:
kamar kecil toilet;  
kamar yang kecil small room
  small room 
orang tua parents;  
orang yang tua old people
  old people
meja hijau law court;  
meja yang hijau green table
  green table
kambing hitam scapegoat;  kambing yang hitam black 
  black goat  
  (coloured) goat
If more than one adjective occurs the ﬁ rst may form a close unit 
with the noun, while the second is preceded by yang:
gadis kuno yang malu-malu
a shy old-fashioned girl
tubuh tua yang ringkih
a frail old body
Coordinated adjectives must be preceded by yang:
anak yang rajin dan pandai
a hard-working and clever child

152 Phrases
A sequence of more than two adjectives usually requires dan 
‘and’ only before the ﬁ nal adjective:
wanita yang cantik, periang dan cerdas
a woman who is beautiful, cheerful and intelligent
Yang is obligatory before an adjective phrase (see 2.99ff) within 
the noun phrase except that it need not occur before a su per la-
tive adjective phrase with paling or ter- ‘most’:
gempa bumi terburuk di daerah ini
the worst earthquake in this district
kelompok paling kuat
the strongest group
With other adjective phrases yang is obligatory:
jas yang terlalu besar
a jacket which is too big
orang yang lebih kaya
richer people
As yang actually introduces a relative clause, predicate elements 
(see 2.132ff) such as negative and temporal markers can precede 
the adjective:
pakaian yang tidak mahal
clothes which aren’t expensive
orang yang sudah cape
people who are already tired
Modifying verbs
A modifying verb immediately follows the head noun and describes 
what the noun is used for. Verbal afﬁ xes are usually lost:
kamar tidur bedroom
kamar mandi bathroom
meja tulis desk, writing table
mesin ketik typewriter
ruang tunggu waiting room
lapangan terbang aerodrome
Some people retain preﬁ x ber- on a modifying verb; others 
regard this as incorrect:
2.46

Nouns and noun phrases 153
kolam renang/berenang swimming pool
 tempat kerja/bekerja workplace
Some modifying verbs indicate the process the noun under-
goes:
nasi goreng fried rice
ubi rebus boiled cassava
Attributive verbs
The relationship between the head noun and attributive verb is 
that of subject and verb in a clause. Attributive verbs differ from 
relative clauses (see 3.98) in two ways.
First, yang does not precede the verb. Secondly, the attribu-
tive verb, unlike the verb in a relative clause, cannot be expanded 
by other clause components, except as indicated below. Attribu-
tive verbs are usually ber- verbs with a noun base (see 1.169ff). 
These refer to states or permanent conditions, not to actions:
kendaraan bermotor motor vehicle
sayur-sayuran bergizi nutritious vegetables
perampok bersenjata armed robbers
Some attributive verbs have compound noun bases consisting of 
a head noun and a following adjective or number (see 1.176):
pesawat berbadan lebar a wide-bodied plane
gedung bertingkat tiga a three-storey building
bocah berusia sembilan tahun a nine-year-old boy
The noun which forms the base of the attributive verb may be 
modiﬁ ed by another noun:
rumah beratap seng a tin-roofed house
kapal berbendera Amerika a ship with an American ﬂ ag
listrik bertenaga surya solar-powered electricity
The attributive verb may have a noun complement (see 3.64):
pemuda bernama Gaston a youth named Gaston
buku berjudul ‘Rajiv’ a book entitled ‘Rajiv’
Stative ter- verbs (see 1.266) can also occur in attributive 
position:
2.47

154 Phrases
ujian tertulis written exam
wawancara terpisah separate interviews
Some more or less set expressions also occur as an attributive 
to a noun, such as tak dikenal ‘unidentiﬁ ed’ and tak berdosa 
‘innocent’:
Rumahnya dirampas oleh dua orang tak dikenal.
His house was robbed by two unidentiﬁ ed people.
bayi tak berdosa
an innocent baby
An attributive verb can always be preceded by yang; in this case, 
however, it becomes a relative clause (see 3.98) and is capable of 
all the expansion that can occur in such a clause.
Relative clauses in the noun phrase
One way of adding information about a noun is by placing a 
clause within the noun phrase; this is called a relative clause. 
A relative clause is always preceded by yang. Relative clauses 
containing an adjective are discussed in section 2.45 and other 
relative clauses in sections 3.97ff.
Adjuncts in the noun phrase
Adjuncts are discussed in sections 2.165–215. Some adjuncts 
can occur within noun phrases, including adverbs of manner 
(see 2.166), prepositional phrases (see 2.118ff) and adjuncts of 
time (see 2.182).
Adverbs of manner which can occur in a noun phrase include 
begini, semacam ini, seperti ini ‘like this’, begitu, demikian, 
sedemikian, seperti itu ‘like that’:
bioskop seperti ini a cinema like this
pikiran begitu thoughts like that
A variety of prepositional phrases can occur in the noun phrase, 
of which the following are a few examples:
petani dari Aceh
a farmer from Aceh
dongeng tentang seorang haji
a story about a haji
2.48
2.49

Nouns and noun phrases 155
uang untuk pondokan
money for boarding
pertemuan antara kedua pemimpin itu
a meeting between the two leaders
serangan dengan batu bata
an attack with bricks
Adjuncts of time are illustrated by the following:
pesta kemarin the party yesterday
pengumuman tadi malam the announcement last night
Functions of -nya in the noun phrase
This sufﬁ x has several functions within the noun phrase. It can 
function as a third person possessive pronoun (see 2.72), or as a 
ligature before a possessive noun (see 2.44).
It can also occur attached to the head noun, being trans-
lated ‘the’. This can occur where the noun has not before been 
mentioned but is understood within the context of the utter-
ance. Where a thing or person has recently been mentioned, itu 
must be used in the repetition (see 2.9). The different distribu-
tions of itu and -nya are shown by the following sentences:1
Ibu sudah memasak nasi. Nasi itu di lemari.
 Mother has cooked rice. It is in the pantry. (literally: ‘That 
rice is in the pantry.’)
Kalau mau makan, nasinya di lemari.
If you want to eat, the rice is in the pantry.
In the ﬁ rst sentence above, nasi itu ‘that rice’ refers to the rice 
already mentioned. (The English translation has ‘it’, which has no 
equivalent in Indonesian—see 2.73–4.) As nasi is not mentioned 
previously in the second example, itu is not possible. However, 
when reference is made to eating in Indonesia rice is understood, 
and thus -nya can occur. In the following examples, perawatnya 
‘the nurse’ and airnya ‘the water’ are possible because nurses are 
assumed in the context of a hospital and water is necessary for 
bathing:
2.50

156 Phrases
 Ia menilai pelayanan di rumah sakit cukup baik. ‘Begitu 
dibel, perawatnya langsung datang’, katanya.
 He regards service in the hospital as very good. ‘No sooner is 
she called than the nurse immediately comes,’ he said.
Saya ingin mandi, tetapi airnya tidak ada.
I wanted to have a bath but there wasn’t any water.
In the following examples the ﬁ rst sentence assumes a dog is kept 
in the house, the second presupposes a newspaper is de livered, 
while in the third it is understood that there is a way to the post 
ofﬁ ce:
Apa anjingnya sudah diberi makan?
Has the dog been fed?
Di mana korannya?
Where is the newspaper?
Saya mau ke kantor pos tapi tidak tahu jalannya.
I want to go to the post ofﬁ ce but I don’t know the way.
Use of -nya in this way is optional; it tends to be used by Indo-
nesians whose regional language has a similar construction.
Reﬂ exive sendiri
The reﬂ exive sendiri ‘self’ occurs with nouns and pronouns (see 
2.81) to emphasise or make clear who or what is being referred to:
Ibu sendiri yang memasak kue ini.
It was mother herself who made this cake.
Buku ini ditulis oleh Pak Bambang sendiri.
This book was written by Mr Bambang himself.
Sendiri is frequently, though optionally, separated from a 
subject noun phrase and placed after the verb or after the object 
of the verb (as also occurs in English):
Dia sendiri datang/Dia datang sendiri.
He came himself.
 Kami sendiri membangun rumah ini/Kami membangun 
rumah ini sendiri.
We built this house ourselves.
2.51

Nouns and noun phrases 157
Colloquially sendiri is often used after the verb instead of send-
irian, seorang diri ‘alone, by oneself’ (see 2.178).
Following a possessive noun or pronoun, sendiri translates 
‘own’:
Sayur-sayuran ini dari kebun ibu sendiri.
These vegetables are from mother’s own garden.
Budi harus membayar dari kantongnya sendiri.
Budi must pay from his own pocket.
Some people allow a possessive to be ellipted (see 4.111) before 
sendiri if the person it refers to has recently been mentioned. In 
the following example, -nya is ellipted:
Nelayan merasa di laut seperti di rumah sendiri.
 When they are at sea the ﬁ shermen feel as if in their own 
home.
Sendiri also occurs in reﬂ exive phrases (see 2.162).
Lain and lainnya in the noun phrase
Following a noun both lain and lainnya translate ‘other, another’. 
However, they have different meanings.
Lain means ‘other’ in a contrastive sense. That is, ‘other, 
something or someone different’:
Kita harus menghormati hak orang lain.
We must respect the rights of other people.
Lainnya means ‘other’ in the sense of ‘something extra, some-
thing or someone in addition’:
 Selama di Amerika dia disertai isterinya, anak-anaknya 
dan beberapa orang lainnya.
 While in America he was accompanied by his wife, his 
children and several other people.
Both lain and lainnya can be preceded by yang, in which case 
they are treated as relative clauses (see 3.98).
Attributive nouns in action noun phrases
Action nouns can be followed by attributive nouns, which 
do not occur in other types of noun phrase. While these 
2.52
2.53

158 Phrases
attributives bear a relationship to possessive nouns, they require 
special treatment. They differ from modifying nouns (2.37) 
in that they can themselves be full noun phrases and can be 
preceded by a preposition.
Action nouns usually have afﬁ xation peN-…-an (see 1.87), but 
some have -an (see 1.62) and some have other afﬁ xes or are afﬁ xless. 
An action noun always relates to the meaning of a transitive verb; 
thus pembunuhan ‘killing, murder’ relates to membunuh ‘kill’.
The attributive noun can relate to the head noun as either 
actor or patient of the corresponding verb (for a discussion of 
‘actor’ and ‘patient’ see section 3.17). The relationship may be 
ambiguous:
pembunuhan pemilik toko
 the killing of the shopkeeper
Here it is not clear (out of context) whether the shopkeeper 
performs the action (the actor) or is affected by the action 
(the patient). Thus the above phrase may derive from either of 
the following constructions:
Pemilik toko membunuh.
The shopkeeper killed (someone).
Pemilik toko dibunuh.
The shopkeeper was killed (by someone).
Frequently the relationship is made clear by use of oleh ‘by’ 
before an actor attributive and by a preposition, usually terhadap 
‘of, toward’, before a patient attributive:
pembunuhan oleh pemilik toko
 the killing by the shopkeeper
pembunuhan terhadap pemilik toko
the killing of the shopkeeper (by someone)
Attributives relating to the head noun as actor and patient can 
occur together, in which case the second requires a preposition. 
Their relative ordering is free:
penuduhan lurah oleh bupati
the accusation of the village head by the bupati
penuduhan lurah terhadap bupati
the village head’s accusation of the bupati

Nouns and noun phrases 159
The ﬁ rst phrase above relates to Lurah dituduh oleh bupati 
‘The village head was accused by the bupati’, and the second 
relates to Lurah menuduh bupati ‘The village head accused the 
bupati’.
A preposition may occur before each of the attributives:
 pemukulan terhadap pengemudi sepeda motor oleh 
seorang polisi
the beating of a motorcyclist by a policeman
The following examples illustrate occurrence of attributive 
nouns with action nouns which do not have afﬁ x peN-…-an:
kecaman keras negara-negara itu terhadap Iran
the strong criticism by those countries of Iran
serangan oleh seorang gerilya
an attack by a guerrilla
 eksploitasi negara-negara kaya terhadap negara-negara 
miskin
exploitation by wealthy countries of poor countries
Several other prepositions can replace terhadap as marker of 
the patient attributive, of which atas is the most frequent. Dari 
also occurs:
pemboman atas kota itu
the bombing of that city
pengangkutan olehnya dari barang ini
the transporting by him of these goods
Bahwa and supaya/agar complements in noun phrases
Some nouns can take a complement introduced by bahwa ‘that’ 
(see 3.108) or supaya/agar ‘(so) that’ (see 3.119):
laporan-laporan bahwa kegiatan tersebut telah berhenti
reports that those activities have ceased
seruan agar perdamaian tercipta
an appeal that peace be achieved
Such complements occur with nouns which correspond to verbs 
which can take the same complements. Thus the phrase laporan 
bahwa … ‘the report that …’ is based on (Dia) melaporkan 
bahwa … ‘(He) reported that …’; the phrase seruan agar … 
2.54

160 Phrases
‘an appeal (so) that …’ is based on (Dia) berseru agar … ‘(He) 
appealed that …’.
Word order within the noun phrase
This discussion is restricted to the relative ordering of certain 
constituents of the noun phrase which occur after the head 
noun: modifying nouns, adjectives, possessors, relative clauses, 
attributive nouns and demonstratives.
A modifying noun directly follows the head, preceding all other 
post-head elements including adjectives and possessors:
toko buku besar
a big bookshop
guru bahasa saya
my language teacher
A possessor follows an adjective:
sikap tegas bapak
father’s ﬁ rm attitude
galangan kapal terbesar Korea Selatan
South Korea’s largest shipyard
Attributive nouns in action noun phrases also follow 
adjectives:
kecaman keras negara-negara itu terhadap Iran
the harsh criticism of Iran by those countries
Relative clauses follow modifying nouns, adjectives and 
possessors:
drama yang dipentaskan tadi malam
the play which was staged last night
An adjective preceded by yang is a relative clause (see 3.98). In 
this case it follows a possessor, whereas without yang it precedes 
the possessor, as in section 2.57:
sikap bapak yang tegas
father’s ﬁ rm attitude
2.55
2.56
2.57
2.58
2.59

Nouns and noun phrases 161
The demonstratives follow all other constituents of the phrase. 
In the following example the demonstrative follows an adjective 
and possessor:
baju merah saya ini
this red shirt of mine
The presence of a demonstrative thus marks the end of a noun 
phrase. The ﬁ rst construction below is a noun phrase ending in 
itu, the second is a clause in which the subject noun phrase ends 
in itu and is followed by an adjective predicate, while the third 
construction is also a clause in which the subject is itu (see 2.65) 
and the predicate is a noun phrase:
rumah besar itu
that big house
Rumah itu besar.
That house is big.
Itu rumah besar.
That is a big house.
Structural ambiguity may occur if there is more than one 
noun preceding a demonstrative. In the following phrase 
nelayan ‘ﬁ sherman’ is either a modifying noun describing 
what sort of house is being referred to, in which case ini refers 
to the head word rumah ‘house’ (because a modifying noun 
cannot usually be the head of a phrase—see 2.37ff), or it is a 
possessor, specifying the owner of the house, in which case ini 
refers to nelayan:
rumah nelayan ini
this ﬁ sherman’s house
or the house of this ﬁ sherman
In the following example, itu may refer to the head word, 
tuduhan itu ‘those charges’, or to the attributive, Robert itu ‘that 
(person) Robert’ (demonstratives can follow proper nouns—
see 2.7):
tuduhan terhadap Robert itu
those charges against Robert
or the charges against that (person) Robert
2.60

162 Phrases
Ambiguity may result when a demonstrative follows a relative 
clause ending in a noun; the demonstrative may refer to the head 
word or it may be part of the noun phrase within the relative 
clause, referring to the ﬁ nal noun of the relative clause. Thus the 
following example may be interpreted as containing anak … itu 
‘that child’ or … sepeda itu ‘that bicycle’:
Anak yang naik sepeda itu tinggal dekat saya.
That child riding a bike lives near me.
or The child riding that bike lives near me.
Although it is widely regarded as unacceptable, itu sometimes 
occurs before a relative clause in journalistic style, especially if 
the relative clause is long. Most people would place itu at the 
end of the subject noun phrase, after aktivis, in the following 
sentence:
 Kapal carteran itu, yang mengangkut para pelajar dan 
kaum aktivis, kembali menuju Darwin.
 The charter boat, which was transporting the students and 
activists, turned back to Darwin.
Noun phrases in apposition
When two noun phrases occur one after the other and refer to 
the same person or thing, they are in apposition. The second 
noun phrase gives further information about the ﬁ rst, and is 
called the deﬁ ning appositional phrase. The two phrases are 
usually separated in writing by a comma and in speech by a 
slight pause between them. In the ﬁ rst example below, Ola and 
suaminya ‘her husband’ are two noun phrases referring to the 
same person; the second gives information about the ﬁ rst:
Dia menantikan Ola, suaminya.
She awaited Ola, her husband.
Ini namanya Monas, Monumen Nasional.
This is called Monas, the National Monument.
 Pertunjukan lain adalah ketoprak, sandiwara tradisional 
dengan cerita dari sejarah dan dongeng-dongeng.
 Another show is the ketoprak, a traditional play with stories 
from history and legend.
2.61

Nouns and noun phrases 163
The deﬁ ning appositional phrase can itself be followed by a 
deﬁ ning phrase. In the following example, the deﬁ ning phrase 
gives information about Pak Trimo. The deﬁ ning phrase itself 
is followed by a deﬁ ning phrase giving information about 
Banyusumurup:
 Ini Pak Trimo, seorang penduduk di Banyusumurup, 
sebuah desa di lereng Gunung Kidul.
 This is Mr Trimo, a resident of Banyusumurup, a village on 
the slope of Mount Kidul.
The deﬁ ning noun phrase can sometimes occur before the main 
phrase. In this case, a comma is not placed between the two in 
writing:
Suaminya Ola masih belum pulang.
Her husband Ola still hadn’t returned home.
Pemain tenis meja Korea itu maju ke perempat ﬁ nal.
 The Korean table tennis player advanced to the quarter-ﬁ nal.
The apposition can be made explicit by occurrence of yaitu or 
yakni ‘that is’ before the deﬁ ning noun phrase:
 Camat wilayah itu, yakni Pak Sitepu, berkerabat dengan saya.
The district camat, that is Mr Sitepu, was a relative of mine.
 Di sebelah barat Parangtritis terdapat sebuah tempat 
wisata lagi, yaitu Pantai Samas.
 To the west of Parangtritis is another tourist spot, that is 
Samas Beach.
A second type of apposition requires an adjunct before the 
second noun phrase. The second phrase then exempliﬁ es the 
ﬁ rst in some way, as speciﬁ ed by the adjunct. Adjuncts which 
can precede the second noun phrase include:
misalnya, umpamanya for example
terutama especially
termasuk including
seperti such as
 Beberapa pengarang, misalnya Umar Kayam, pernah 
memberi kuliah di sana.
Several writers, for instance Umar Kayam, have given lectures 
there.

PRONOUNS AND PRONOUN PHRASES
A pronoun stands for a noun when it is clear who or what is 
being spoken about. Four types of pronoun are discussed 
here: demonstrative pronouns, personal pronouns, indeﬁ -
nite pronouns and number pronouns. Locative pronouns are 
mentioned in section 2.119, the reﬂ exive pronoun in section 
2.162 and interrogative pronouns in section 4.15.
Demonstrative pronouns
The demonstratives ini ‘this’ and itu ‘that’ (see 2.7) can occur 
alone as demonstrative pronouns. In the following examples, 
they occur as subject of a clause:
Ini besar.
This is big.
Itu teman saya.
That is my friend.
Personal pronouns
Pronouns which refer to people are called personal pronouns. 
These can occur as heads of personal pronoun phrases (see 
2.75–81).
Personal pronouns reﬂ ect social relations between people far 
more than do other parts of the language and a brief discussion 
of their social role is required.
2.64
2.65
2.66

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 165
Only a limited number of words are purely pronominal. The 
full forms of these are:
ﬁ rst person
second person
third person
singular
saya, aku
engkau, kamu,
ia, dia,
kau, anda
beliau
plural
kita incl.
kalian
mereka
kami excl.
The ﬁ rst singular forms both mean ‘I’ but differ in social distri-
bution, as discussed below. The inclusive ﬁ rst plural kita means 
‘we’ where the person being spoken to is included (that is, ‘I and 
you’), while the exclusive ﬁ rst plural kami means ‘we’ where the 
person being spoken to is excluded (that is, ‘I and others but not 
you’). The second person pronouns are all restricted in social 
usage. However, the third person forms are socially neutral 
except beliau ‘he, she (respectful)’.
Pronouns aku ‘I’ and engkau, kau, kamu ‘you singular’ 
and kalian ‘you plural’ (a recently created form not used by 
all speakers) are intimate forms, used to children and between 
equals who have a close relationship with each other. They are 
sometimes used to younger adults, although this always conveys 
a suggestion of social superiority on the part of the speaker. 
However, there is an increasing tendency among many speakers, 
particularly young adults and popular media ﬁ gures, to use 
aku in impersonal situations and public contexts. Some adult 
speakers consider it unacceptable.
The pronouns saya ‘I’ and anda ‘you’ are often said to 
be neutral in social connotation. This is largely true of saya, 
although its use instead of aku usually indicates that an intimate 
relationship does not exist. However, anda conveys social infor-
mation, as discussed below.
The pronouns kita ‘we (inclusive)’, kami ‘we (exclusive)’, ia, 
dia ‘he, she’, and mereka ‘they’ are socially neutral. Of the third 
person pronouns, only beliau ‘he, she’ carries social conno-
tation, referring to people who are held in high respect.
It is among second person pronouns, those used for the 
person being addressed, that most variety occurs.

166 Phrases
Anda, an artiﬁ cial creation introduced in the 1950s, 
was intended as a neutral form, equivalent to English ‘you’. 
However, the mere fact that it does not convey the intimacy of 
engkau, kau and kamu nor indicate a kin relationship meant 
that it was immediately conﬁ ned to impersonal situations, 
such as addressing strangers of the same age as or younger 
than the speaker. It is not widely used in addressing individ uals 
and, because it does not convey respect, cannot be used by a 
junior to a senior. As an impersonal form, it is most frequently 
used in advertisements and public announcements, and in 
addressing people in gatherings such as conferences. The ﬁ rst 
example below is a notice in aeroplanes, while the second is 
taken from an advertisement:
Kenakan sabuk pengaman selama anda duduk.
Fasten your safety belt while you are seated.
Apakah mesin fotokopi anda mencemari lingkungan?
Does your photocopier pollute the environment?
Pronoun substitutes
Pronoun substitutes are personal names and kinship terms used 
instead of pronouns. Saudara ‘sibling or relative of the same 
generation’, like anda, is used widely for ‘you’ to people of the 
speaker’s own generation or younger and has an impersonal tone, 
generally being used towards people with whom the speaker is not 
well acquainted. To females saudari (see 1.42) is sometimes used.
The other pronoun substitutes can mean either ‘I’ or ‘you’. 
Most common are bapak ‘father’ and ibu ‘mother’. These 
are respectful forms used to older people or to any adult of 
marriageable age:
Bapak tinggal di sini?
Do you live here? (said to an older man)
Apa ini anak ibu?
Is this your child? (said to an older woman)
Like all pronoun substitutes these terms are basically nouns, 
used for referring to a third person. Thus the two sentences 
above literally mean ‘Does father live here?’ and ‘Is this mother’s 
child?’ and can also be used in reference to a third person, 
context making clear which is meant.
2.67

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 167
The abbreviated forms pak and bu cannot be used alone as 
pronoun substitutes; that is, they cannot mean ‘you’, occurring 
only as vocatives (see 4.109) in most people’s usage. However, 
in combination with a name they can be used as terms for refer-
ence to a third person or in addressing a second person; that is, 
as pronoun substitutes:
Pak Hasan mau makan sekarang?
Do you want to eat now, Mr Hasan?
The above sentence could also be a question about a third 
person, ‘Does Mr Hasan want to eat now?’
Other abbreviated kinship terms can also combine with names 
and be used in addressing another person: Dik Muji ‘younger 
brother Muji’ (from adik), Kak Eli ‘older sister Eli’ (from kakak), 
Bang Ali ‘older brother Ali’ (from abang). There is a considerable 
amount of regional variation in the use of such terms.
Tuan ‘sir’ and nyonya ‘madam’ (to a married woman) have a 
much more limited role in modern Indonesian than in the past 
but are still used by some people, especially to foreigners. Like 
bapak and ibu, they can also be used with personal names.
As pronoun substitutes bapak and ibu can also mean ‘I’. Here 
they are restricted to use by older people to younger people, 
whether their own children or not:
Ibu mau ke pasar.
 I’m going to the market. (said by a woman to someone 
younger)
Kasi pada bapak!
Give it to me! (said by a man to a younger person)
Personal names are also commonly used as substitutes for ‘I’ 
and ‘you’. This is particularly common among children, as a 
substitute for aku and kamu:
Dinah mau ikut.
I want to come along. (said by a girl named Dinah)
Ini untuk Dinah.
This is for you. (said to a girl named Dinah)
When there is uncertainty about how a person should be 
addressed, Indonesians have a number of strategies for avoiding 
2.68

168 Phrases
giving offence. They may use a more polite form than is neces-
sary, avoid using a pronoun altogether, or use third person -nya. 
The last two possibilities are illustrated:
Siapa namanya?
What is your name? (literally: ‘What is his/her name?’)
Tinggal di mana?
Where do (you) live?
Di mana rumahnya?
Where do you live? (literally: ‘Where is his/her house?’)
The above discussion of pronouns and pronoun substitutes is 
far from exhaustive. Many other forms occur, some conﬁ ned 
to or identiﬁ ed with particular regional usage or restricted to 
speciﬁ c groups. These include Jakartanese gua, gue ‘I’ and lu 
‘you’, and literary forms such as hamba ‘I’. Javanese kin terms 
Mbak ‘older sister’ and Mas ‘older brother’ are used to address 
adults and as affectionate address terms for children. Papa ‘dad’ 
and Mama ‘mum’, as well as papi ‘daddy’ and mami ‘mummy’ 
and ayah ‘father’ and bunda ‘mother’, are pronoun substitutes 
for the speaker’s parents. Among some people, om ‘uncle’ and 
tante ‘aunt’ occur commonly as pronoun substitutes for people 
of similar age to the speaker’s parents and opa ‘grandfather’ and 
oma ‘grandmother’ for people approximately of the same age as 
the speaker’s grandparents.
Among some people, the distinction between kita and kami 
is not always maintained. In some regional varieties kita is 
used for ‘I’.
Third person pronouns dia and ia
Third person singular ia and dia both mean ‘he, she’. Dia can 
occur in all positions. However, ia is restricted in occurrence to 
pre-verbal position. That is, it can be used instead of dia when 
it occurs before a verb, either as subject, in either an active or 
passive sentence, or as agent in a type two passive (see 3.28). In 
all other positions, including object or agent following a verb, 
following a preposition, as predicate and as a possessive, only 
dia can occur (although -nya can occur instead in some of these 
positions—see 2.71):
2.69
2.70

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 169
Dia/ia akan menolong kami.
He will help us.
makanan yang sudah dia/ia pesan
the food he has ordered
makanan yang sudah dipesan (oleh) dia
the food which he has ordered
Kami akan menolong dia.
We will help her.
Berikan buku ini kepada dia.
Give this book to her.
Ini buku dia.
This is her book.
Itu bukan dia.
That isn’t him.
The rule that ia cannot occur after the verb does not apply in 
cases where as subject it follows the verb as a result of change 
from standard word order (see 3.42):
 Melihat raksasa itu datang, bersembunyilah ia ke balik 
batu besar.
 Seeing the giant coming, he hid behind a large rock. (Standard 
word order: Ia bersembunyi …)
Harus pergikah ia?
Must she go? (Standard word order: Ia harus pergi?)
Also, ia can occur as object of the verb if it is the subject of a 
complement as well (see 3.76); in this case, its role as subject 
of the following complement takes precedence over its role as 
object of the preceding verb. Dia and -nya can occur instead 
of ia:
Saya menganggapnya/dia/ia bodoh.
I consider him stupid.
Sikap inilah yang menyebabkan ia dijuluki ‘nyinyir’.
It was this trait which caused him to be nicknamed ‘nagger’.
In older Malay dia was an inﬂ ected form of ia, occurring in 
those positions in which only dia can occur in modern Indo-
nesian. First and second person equivalents daku ‘I’ and dikau 
‘you’ might still occasionally be seen in older literature but are 
lost from the modern language:

fantasi yang indah dan ajaib.
 Her melodious voice enveloped me in a beautiful and 
mys terious fantasy.
Bound forms of pronouns
The singular pronouns aku, engkau and kamu, and dia, 
have bound variants in certain situations. The bound forms 
are:
preﬁ xed
sufﬁ xed
ﬁ rst person
ku-
-ku
second person
kau-
-mu
third person
-nya
The sufﬁ xed forms occur as objects of active verbs:
Narti menungguku/mu/nya.
Narti is waiting for me/you/him.
The sufﬁ xed forms can only occur if the verb has preﬁ x meN-; 
hence they cannot occur with those transitive verbs such as 
makan ‘eat’ which do not have the preﬁ x (see 1.186). In this 
case full pronouns aku, kamu and dia must be used or, if a 
non-human is referred to, either the noun must be repeated 
or ellipsis (see 4.113) occurs. The ﬁ rst sentence below contains 
unpreﬁ xed makan ‘eat’, while the second contains the same verb 
with preﬁ x meN-:
Dia mengambil kue itu lalu makan.
He took the cake and ate [it].
Dia mengambil kue itu lalu memakannya.
He took the cake and ate it.
Sufﬁ xed forms also cannot occur where meN- is dropped in 
colloquial usage or in certain constructions such as impera-
tives (see 4.39). Nor can they occur as complements. Thus -nya 
can occur as object of mempelajari ‘study’: mempelajarinya 
‘study it’, but not as complement of belajar ‘study’ (see 3.63).
The third person sufﬁ xed form occurs as agent of a passive 
verb in passive type one (see 3.27):
2.71

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 171
Narti ditunggunya.
He is waiting for Narti.
The preﬁ xed forms occur as agents of passive verbs in passive 
type two (see 3.28). There is no third person form:
Buku ini sudah kubaca.
I have read this book.
Buku ini sudah kaubaca.
You have read this book.
Bound forms can occur as possessives:
rumahku my house
mobilmu your car
bukunya her book
They also follow some prepositions. Most prepositions (see 
2.118ff) can only be followed by full forms of the pronouns: 
seperti aku ‘like me’, tentang kamu ‘about you’, kecuali dia 
‘except him’, dari dia ‘from her’. Some, like kepada ‘to’, allow 
bound pronouns to follow: kepadaku ‘to me’, kepadamu ‘to 
you’, kepadanya ‘to him’. Other prepositions allowing sufﬁ xed 
pronouns include: pada ‘at, to’, daripada ‘than; from’, bagi ‘for’, 
buat ‘for’, untuk ‘for’, bersama ‘together with’, dengan ‘with’, 
terhadap ‘towards’, oleh ‘by’, dari ‘than’.
In all situations in which the bound forms can occur, corre-
sponding free forms are also possible:
Buku ini sudah aku/engkau baca.
I/you have read this book.
Ini pena aku/kamu/dia.
This is my/your/his pen.
Narti menunggu aku/kamu/dia.
Narti is waiting for me/you/him.
Third person -nya can be plural, meaning ‘they’, as well as 
singular (this is not the case with dia/ia):
Mahasiswa-mahasiswa ini akan melanjutkan pendidikan-
nya di luar negeri.
These students will continue their education overseas.

172 Phrases
Mereka akan membuat rencana dan segala sesuatu akan 
diaturnya sesuai dengan rencana itu.
They will make a plan and they will organise everything in 
accordance with that plan.
Pronouns indicating possession
Indicating possession pronouns must follow a noun; phrasal 
forms corresponding to ‘mine’, ‘his’ and so on do not occur. This 
may require repetition of a noun:
Mobil ini mobil saya.
This car is mine.
To avoid repetition, the ﬁ rst occurrence of the noun is usually 
omitted. Alternatively, the possessive pronoun may be attached 
to a form like kepunyaan ‘possession’, milik ‘property’:
Ini mobil saya.
This is my car.
Mobil ini kepunyaan saya.
This car is mine (my possession).
As mentioned in section 2.71, singular pronouns can occur in 
their free or bound (sufﬁ xed) form to mark possession.
Pronouns referring to non-humans
Most speakers use third person pronouns dia/ia and mereka 
only to refer to humans. The bound form -nya can refer to 
non-human animate and inanimate nouns, both single and 
plural:
Apa namanya?
What’s its name?/What are their names?
Saya sudah membacanya.
I’ve read it/them.
In contexts where -nya cannot occur, there is usually nothing 
corresponding to English ‘it’. This is further discussed in 
section 4.113. In the translations of the following examples, 
‘it’ is placed in square brackets where there is no equivalent in 
Indonesian:
2.72
2.73
2.74

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 173
Hebat, bukan?
[It’s] amazing, isn’t it?
Dia meminyaki rambutnya, supaya mengkilat.
She oiled her hair so that [it] shone.
Surat ini penting. Baca!
This letter is important. Read [it]!
Despite the fact that it is unacceptable to many speakers, there 
is an increasing tendency, especially in journalistic style, for ia 
to mean ‘it’:
‘Australia berada dalam situasi sulit bila ia kalah,’ katanya.
‘Australia will be in a difﬁ cult situation if it loses,’ he said.
Peliharalah taman ini. Ia milik anda.
Look after this park. It is your property.
The use of mereka to refer to non-humans is rare but does occur 
and is becoming increasingly common in journalistic style. In 
the ﬁ rst example below, it refers to horses:2
 Ia datangi dua ekor yang lain, membelai punggung mereka 
masing-masing …
 She approached two others, stroking the backs of each of 
them.
 Bakteri ternyata makhluk yang cukup cerdik. Mereka tak 
menyerang tubuh seenaknya, melainkan memilih sasaran 
tertentu.
 Bacteria are clearly cunning creatures. They do not attack 
the body randomly but choose speciﬁ c targets.
Personal pronoun phrases
Personal pronoun phrases contain a limited number of constit-
uents, including those discussed below. In general, sufﬁ xed 
pronouns can occur with the same phrase elements as free 
pronouns. Preﬁ xed pronouns cannot act as phrase heads.
Demonstratives
The demonstrative ini gives emphasis to ﬁ rst person pronouns:
Kau kira saya ini pelayanmu?
Do you think I am your servant?
2.75
2.76

174 Phrases
With third person itu can occur to indicate location or previous 
mention:
mereka itu
they (over there) or they (who have been mentioned)
Relative clauses in personal pronoun phrases
Adjectives must be preceded by yang in pronoun phrases. They 
are thus relative clauses (see 3.98):
saya yang kecil ini I who am small
kamu yang pandai you who are clever
Apart from adjectives, relative clauses occur only after mereka. 
In this case the pronoun acts like orang, meaning ‘people 
who …, those who …’:
mereka yang tetap tinggal di desa
those who continue to live in the village
mereka yang tidak hadir
those who are not present
Numbers in pronoun phrases
A limited number of deﬁ nite and indeﬁ nite numbers are the 
only quantiﬁ ers which occur with personal pronouns.
Numbers with preﬁ x ber- (see 1.158) are the only deﬁ nite 
numbers which can accompany pronouns. Following a pronoun 
they indicate a group, having the same meaning as collective 
numbers with ke- preceding a noun (see 2.17):
mereka berdua
both of them
Kita bertiga menghadap kepala sekolah.
The three of us appeared before the school principal.
Several indeﬁ nite numbers (see 2.113) can occur with pronouns, 
including semua ‘all’, sekalian ‘all’, masing-masing ‘each’. 
Although they precede nouns (see 2.19), indeﬁ nite numbers 
follow pronouns:
Mereka masing-masing memperoleh sebidang tanah.
They each received a plot of land.
Kami semua harus membuka jalan dahulu.
All of us must clear a road ﬁ rst.
2.77
2.78
2.79
2.80

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 175
The indeﬁ nite number sekalian is sometimes used as a plural 
indicator for second person: saudara/anda/engkau sekalian 
‘you (plural)’. However, it also occurs with other pronouns: 
mereka sekalian ‘all of them’.
Reﬂ exive sendiri
This functions as with nouns (see 2.51):
Ini rumahku sendiri.
This is my own house.
As with nouns, sendiri can be separated from a pronoun 
subject:
Kamu sendiri harus pergi/Kamu harus pergi sendiri.
You must go yourself.
Apposition
A pronoun can be in apposition (see 2.61) with a noun 
phrase:
kami, bangsa Indonesia
we, the people of Indonesia
Indeﬁ nite pronouns
These indicate that a person or thing is being spoken about 
without a particular person or thing being identiﬁ ed.
The pronouns seseorang and sesuatu correspond to English 
‘someone’ and ‘something’ respectively:
Saya akan menyuruh seseorang menjemput mereka.
I’ll tell someone to meet them.
Dia makan sesuatu.
She ate something.
The phrase segala sesuatu ‘everything’ refers to all the things 
being discussed without them being named individually:
Dia membicarakan segala sesuatu.
He discussed everything.
Sesuatu and segala sesuatu can take a relative clause (see 3.98):
2.81
2.82
2.83
2.84

176 Phrases
Ada sesuatu yang kurang baik.
There is something which isn’t good.
Segala sesuatu yang dikatakannya selalu menarik.
Everything she says is always interesting.
Corresponding to English indeﬁ nite pronouns beginning with 
‘any’ are forms consisting of a question word (see 4.14) followed 
by saja. The interrogative mana follows a locative preposition 
(see 2.119) or a noun:
siapa saja anyone
apa saja anything
di/ke/dari mana saja (at/to/from) anywhere
mana saja any
kapan saja any time
berapa saja any amount
Siapa saja boleh ikut.
Anyone can come along.
Kamu boleh minum apa saja.
You can drink anything.
Taruh barang itu di mana saja.
Put those things anywhere.
Anda bisa bepergian ke mana saja.
You can travel anywhere.
Kalau libur kami menginap di hotel mana saja.
When on holidays we stay in any hotel at all.
Singgah di rumah kapan saja.
Call in any time at all.
Ambil berapa saja.
Take any amount you like.
All the above interrogatives except kapan and berapa can be 
followed by pun instead of saja:
Sekarang koran bisa dibungkam untuk apa pun.
Now a newspaper can be silenced for anything.
 Saya tidak bisa menerima pembredelan oleh siapa pun dan 
di mana pun.
I cannot accept banning by anyone anywhere.
2.85

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 177
Many people write pun attached to the interrogative: siapapun 
and so on.
The forms apa pun/apa saja and mana pun/mana saja occur in 
a noun phrase after a negated predicate instead of the redupli-
cated forms discussed in 2.89:
Mereka tidak memberi informasi apa pun.
They didn’t give any information at all.
Kami tidak berkunjung ke desa mana saja.
We didn’t visit any village at all.
Forms with saja also occur in questions, but with a different 
meaning (see 4.22).
Indeﬁ nite pronouns can be followed by a relative clause (see 2.98) 
and almost invariably are if they occur in subject position:
Siapa pun yang berbuat onar akan ditindak.
Anyone who causes trouble will be acted against.
Apa saja yang diucapkannya selalu benar.
Whatever he states is always correct.
Alternative to siapa saja, though more formal, is the form 
barang siapa ‘anyone’. This form only occurs as subject of a 
clause and is frequently followed by a relative clause. Barang 
siapa is commonly used in warnings and appeals:
Barang siapa yang bersalah harus dihukum.
Anyone who is guilty must be punished.
 Barang siapa menemukan dompet itu akan diberi hadiah.
 Anyone who ﬁ nds the wallet will be rewarded.
Reduplicated forms of siapa, apa and mana have the same 
meanings as the forms mentioned in section 2.85 but follow a 
negated predicate (reduplicated mana can also follow a positive 
predicate—see 2.90):
Saya tidak bertemu dengan siapa-siapa.
I didn’t meet anyone.
Dia tidak tahu apa-apa.
He doesn’t know anything.
2.86
2.87
2.88
2.89

178 Phrases
Saya tidak pergi ke mana-mana.
I didn’t go anywhere.
If the indeﬁ nite pronoun occurs in a noun phrase following 
a negated predicate, a form with saja or pun is more likely to 
occur (see examples in 2.86).
If siapa-siapa and apa-apa occur as predicates, they are 
negated by bukan:
Dalam sumber alam Taiwan bukan apa-apa dibandingkan 
dengan Indonesia.
In natural resources Taiwan is nothing compared with 
Indonesia.
The reduplicated form (di/ke/dari) mana-mana can also 
occur after a positive predicate, meaning ‘(at/to/from) every-
where’:
Pengungsi itu datang dari mana-mana.
The refugees came from everywhere.
The indeﬁ nite pronouns siapa-siapa and apa-apa must follow 
a negated predicate, as mentioned in section 2.89. They there-
fore cannot occur in subject position. Instead, the following 
forms occur:
tidak seorang pun no one
tidak satu pun nothing
This distribution of the forms is partly similar to that of forms 
with ‘not … any(one)’ and ‘no (one)’ in English, the difference 
being illustrated by the ﬁ rst two sentences below:
Saya tidak mengenal siapa-siapa di sini.
I don’t know anyone here.
Tidak seorang pun mengenal saya di sini.
No one knows me here.
Tidak seorang pun tersenyum kepadanya.
No one smiled at him.
Tak satu pun menarik perhatiannya.
Nothing interested her.
2.90
2.91

Pronouns and pronoun phrases 179
The forms tidak seorang pun and tidak satu pun can precede a 
noun to mean ‘not a single’; tidak satu pun can occur with both 
human and non-human nouns:
Tidak seorang pun prajurit yang cedera.
Not a single soldier was injured.
Tidak satu pun pengadilan yang akan menghukum dia.
Not a single court will sentence him.
Such phrases can also follow a negated verb; in this case, tidak 
does not occur with the pronoun. In the following example the 
verb ada ‘exist’ is negated by belum:
Belum ada satu pun desainer Indonesia yang mampu 
merancang padang golf bertaraf internasional.
There is not yet a single Indonesian designer who can design 
an international class golf course.
Other classiﬁ ers can replace orang in tidak seorang pun (see 
2.91) as appropriate. Thus pucuk, the classiﬁ er for guns (see 
2.22), can occur with senapan:
Tak sepucuk pun senapan yang meletus.
Not a single gun went off.
Number pronouns
These are based on several types of deﬁ nite and indeﬁ nite 
numbers.
Collective numbers with preﬁ x ke-, meaning ‘both’, ‘all three’ 
and so on (see 1.153) can take sufﬁ x -nya to form pronouns. 
These forms can also have a reduplicated base, with or without 
ke-; thus keduanya, kedua-duanya, dua-duanya ‘both of them, 
either of them’, ketiganya, ketiga-tiganya, tiga-tiganya ‘all three 
of them’:
Arti kedua kata itu sama; anda dapat mempergunakan 
kedua-duanya.
The meanings of those two words are the same; you can use 
either of them.
In combination with a negative they are translated ‘neither of 
them, none of them, not any of them’:
2.92
2.93
2.94

180 Phrases
Saya tidak suka kedua-duanya/dua-duanya/keduanya.
I don’t like either of them.
Ini selokan atau jalan? 
– Bukan dua-duanya.
Is this a gutter or a road? 
– (It is) neither.
These forms can occur as subjects in topic-comment construc-
tions (see 3.90).
Several indeﬁ nite numbers (see 2.113) can occur as pronouns, 
in which case they take sufﬁ x -nya. These include:
semuanya all of them
segalanya all of them
seluruhnya all of it, the whole
Tidak semuanya meninggal.
Not all of them died.
These forms can occur as subjects in topic-comment construc-
tions (see 3.90).
Masing-masing can occur as a number pronoun meaning ‘each 
of them’; it does not take -nya:
Kedua kota itu hampir sama besarnya. Masing-masing 
berpenduduk sekitar empat ratus ribu orang.
Those two cities are almost the same size. Each of them has 
a population of about four hundred thousand people.
ADJECTIVES AND ADJECTIVE PHRASES
An adjective phrase is a sequence of words which functions 
in the same way as an adjective; that is, it occurs in the same 
positions in a clause as a single adjective. It always contains an 
adjective as its head. Adjectives are discussed in section 2.98. 
The other major components of adjective phrases are discussed 
in sections 2.99–105.
Adjectives
An adjective is a word which describes a noun; it tells something 
about a person or thing, such as its shape or size (besar ‘big’, 
2.95
2.96
2.97
2.98

Adjectives and adjective phrases 181
bulat ‘round’, gemuk ‘fat’), colour (hijau ‘green’, hitam ‘black’), 
condition (bersih ‘clean’, kotor ‘dirty’, rusak ‘broken’) or other 
characteristics (baik ‘good’, pandai ‘clever’, senang ‘happy’, 
cantik ‘pretty’, hati-hati ‘careful’).
Two adjectives may form a compound (see 1.31). The order 
of the two adjectives in such compounds is ﬁ xed; the second 
word usually acts to strengthen the meaning of the ﬁ rst word, as 
in lemah lembut ‘gentle’.
A compound may also consist of an adjective and a follow-
ing noun. Such forms are idiomatic, such as buta huruf ‘illiter-
ate’, keras kepala ‘stubborn’, panjang tangan ‘having a tendency 
to steal’.
A compound may consist of a colour term and a follow-
ing noun or adjective which makes it more speciﬁ c: merah tua 
‘dark red’, biru muda ‘light blue’, hijau daun ‘leaf green’, kuning 
gading ‘ivory yellow’.
Two adjectives may be juxtaposed to form a kind of coordi-
nation, without dan ‘and’ occurring between them. The order 
of adjectives in such pairs is ﬁ xed, such as tinggi kurus ‘tall and 
thin’, tegap gesit ‘ﬁ rm and agile’:
Perawakannya tinggi langsing, pembawaannya tegap gesit.
Her ﬁ gure was tall and slender, her bearing ﬁ rm and agile.
Other pairs like this include hitam manis ‘dark and attractive’, 
tinggi tegap ‘tall and strong’, halus mulus ‘ﬁ ne and smooth’, 
cerdas tangkas ‘intelligent and quick-witted’.
Juxtaposed adjectives may also indicate alternatives, atau ‘or’ 
being omitted between them, such as panjang pendek ‘long or 
short’, baik buruk ‘good or bad’. Such pairs, written with a hyphen 
and followed by -nya, are frequently nominalised (see 3.139).
A number of verbs can act as adjectives, being able to occur 
with many of the components of the adjective phrase, such as 
modifying adverbs, lebih ‘more’ and paling ‘most’. These include 
membosankan ‘boring’ and similar forms (see 1.194), menarik 
‘attractive’ and many of the verbs with preﬁ x ber- based on nouns 
(see 1.169ff), such as berbahaya ‘dangerous’, berhasil ‘success-
ful’, berguna ‘useful’. The indeﬁ nite numbers banyak ‘much’ and 
sedikit ‘a little’ can also function in the same way (see examples 
in 2.113).

182 Phrases
Adjective phrases
Adjectives act as heads of a variety of different phrase struc-
tures. Some of the important components of adjective phrases 
are discussed in the following sections. Not all adjectives can 
occur with all the phrase elements discussed; some subclasses 
of adjective are restricted in the elements with which they can 
co-occur.
Modifying adverbs
The adjective can be preceded by one of a number of mod ifying 
adverbs. These show the amount or intensity of the quality indi-
cated by the adjective. These include:
sangat, amat very
terlalu, terlampau too
sungguh really, truly
cukup enough
relatif relatively
serba completely
agak rather
makin, semakin, kian, tambah, bertambah increasingly
begitu, demikian, sedemikian so, like that
begini so, like this
Beban ini sungguh berat.
This load is truly heavy.
Tingkat radiasi relatif tinggi.
The radiation level is relatively high.
Iran secara militer sudah makin kuat.
Militarily Iran has become increasingly strong.
Mengapa saudara demikian lelah?
Why are you so tired?
A number of modifying adverbs follow the adjective, including:
sekali very
belaka entirely, completely
sama sekali entirely
benar really
2.99
2.100

Adjectives and adjective phrases 183
Janjinya palsu belaka.
His promises are completely false.
Urusannya sudah beres sama sekali.
His affairs are entirely in order.
The adverb sedikit ‘a little’ can precede or follow the adjective:
sedikit pusing/pusing sedikit
a little dizzy
A few modifying adverbs can co-occur for emphasis. The 
commonest combinations are amat sangat ‘exceedingly’, 
sangat … sekali ‘exceedingly’, agak … sedikit ‘somewhat’:
Daging ini agak mahal sedikit.
This meat is somewhat expensive.
Dia amat sangat kaya.
He is extremely rich.
Some of the modifying adverbs, including cukup ‘enough’ and 
terlalu ‘too’, can co-occur with a phrase beginning with untuk, 
bagi or buat ‘for’ (see 2.105).
When the adjective phrase occurs as a predicate (see 3.9) 
with tidak, most speakers replace sekali ‘very’ by begitu ‘so’:
Rumahnya tidak begitu besar.
His house isn’t very big.
Modifying adverbs like makin commonly occur in correlative 
structures, such as:
Ali makin besar makin sombong.
The older Ali gets the more arrogant he becomes.
These constructions are discussed in section 4.90.
Comparative phrases
The comparative adjective phrase is formed by placing lebih 
‘more’ before the adjective: lebih besar ‘bigger’, lebih jelas 
‘clearer’, lebih indah ‘more beautiful’, lebih jelek ‘uglier’:
Halte bis yang baru lebih jelek dari yang lama.
The new bus stop is uglier/worse than the old one.
2.101

184 Phrases
 Baju longgar membuat tubuh kurus kelihatan lebih kurus.
Loose clothing makes a thin body look thinner.
The word kurang also occurs in adjective phrases to mean ‘not 
enough, not as’: kurang manis ‘not sweet enough, not as sweet’, 
kurang canggih ‘not sophisticated enough, not as sophisticated’. 
Kurang is not used in comparative phrases to mean ‘less’; thus 
‘less expensive’ cannot be expressed as kurang mahal as this 
phrase means ‘not expensive enough’.
Kurang is also used with some adjectives to form euphemis-
tic expressions: kurang tepat ‘inaccurate’ (literally: ‘less than 
accurate’), kurang sopan ‘impolite, rude’ (literally: ‘less than 
polite’), kurang mampu ‘ﬁ nancially disadvantaged, poor’ (liter-
ally: ‘less than able’), kurang cekatan ‘slow, unskilled’ (literally: 
‘less than dexterous’). Kurang ajar is an idiomatic phrase liter-
ally meaning ‘less than educated’ but used to mean ‘impolite, 
rude’.
The major expansion of the comparative phrase is with dari 
or daripada ‘than’ followed by a noun phrase indicating the 
person or thing with which comparison is being made:3
Dia lebih tinggi dari saya.
He is taller than me.
Lebih baik mencegah daripada mengobati.
 Prevention is better than treatment. (literally: ‘It’s better to 
prevent than to treat.’)
Lebih can itself be preceded by a number of modiﬁ ers, in cluding 
jauh ‘far’, sedikit ‘a little’, a number followed by kali ‘times’ 
(see 2.197) or a noun indicating distance, weight or measure:
Rumah ini jauh lebih mahal dari rumah itu.
This house is far more expensive than that one.
Situasi hari Minggu sedikit lebih tenang.
The situation on Sunday was a little calmer.
Kota ini dua puluh kali lebih besar.
This town is twenty times bigger.
Jalan ini tiga meter lebih lebar daripada jalan-jalan lain.
This road is three metres wider than the other roads.

Adjectives and adjective phrases 185
To say that something/someone is less than something/someone 
else, kalah is used. Kalah can also be preceded by a negative:
Tuti kalah cantik.
 Tuti is not as pretty (compared to someone else not mentioned 
but known from the context).
‘Siapa bilang?’ bantah saya, tak kalah keras.
‘Who said so?’ I protested, no less harshly.
When kalah occurs, dari(pada) can be replaced by dengan:
 Tulisan Subagio tidak kalah blak-blakan dengan tulisan 
orang Australia yang mana pun.
 Subagio’s writing is no less frank than that of any 
Aus tralian.
Superlative phrases
These are formed by placing paling ‘most’ or preﬁ x ter- before 
the adjective: paling kaya, terkaya ‘richest’, paling tinggi, tert-
inggi ‘highest’.
Many people allow preﬁ x ter- only with two-syllable adjec-
tives; it cannot occur with longer adjectives, compounds or 
verbs acting adjectivally. Thus it cannot replace paling in 
paling berani ‘bravest’, paling berguna ‘most useful’, paling 
men yenangkan ‘most pleasing’, paling keras kepala ‘most 
obstinate’. The exception is a few words which are actually made 
adjectival by addition of ter-; thus belakang ‘behind’ and ke 
muka ‘to the front’ act as adjectives only in terbelakang ‘most 
backward, last’ and terkemuka ‘most prominent, foremost’.
A superlative phrase can be expanded by a number of delim-
iting prepositional phrases, most commonly phrases beginning 
with dari ‘of’ or di ‘in’:
 Nasi goreng yang paling enak dari semua makanan yang 
tersedia.
Fried rice is the tastiest of all the food available.
Ini gempa bumi terburuk di daerah ini.
This was the worst earthquake in this district.
A superlative phrase can contain an ordinal number (see 1.151) 
indicating ranking. Preﬁ x ke- on the ordinal can be replaced by 
nomor ‘number’:
2.102

186 Phrases
Dia petinju terbaik kedua/Dia petinju terbaik nomor dua.
He is the second best boxer.
The ordinal can precede the head of the adjective phrase, in 
which case yang optionally comes between the ordinal and 
head:
Ini nomor delapan terendah.
This is the eighth lowest.
Dia petinju kedua yang terbaik.
He is the second best boxer.
The ordinal can co-occur with a delimiter:
 Vietnam akan menjadi negara pengekspor beras ketiga 
terbesar di dunia.
 Vietnam will become the third largest exporter of rice in the 
world.
Equative phrases
An equative construction says that one thing is similar to 
another in the quality indicated by the adjective. The other 
thing is expressed as a qualiﬁ er following the adjective. There 
are two constructions:
a. se- + adjective + qualiﬁ er
b. sama + adjective-nya dengan + qualiﬁ er
The latter construction is actually a type of topic-comment 
construction (see 3.87) which needs discussion here because of 
its meaning. The qualiﬁ er is usually a noun phrase:
Gedung ini setinggi gedung itu.
Gedung ini sama tingginya dengan gedung itu.
This building is as tall as that building.
The qualiﬁ er may be ini ‘this’ or itu ‘that’ or a nominalised 
construction (see 3.132) with yang ini ‘this one’ or yang itu ‘that 
one’. The difference in meaning is shown by the following:
Buku ini tidak semahal yang itu.
This book is not as expensive as that one.
Buku ini tidak semahal itu.
This book is not that expensive.
2.103

Adjectives and adjective phrases 187
In the ﬁ rst sentence above yang itu refers to another book, 
while in the second itu refers to, for instance, a price previously 
mentioned.
With the se- construction the qualiﬁ er can be a relative 
clause:
Saya tidak sebodoh yang dikira orang.
I’m not as silly as people think.
The sama … -nya construction cannot be used if the pre ceding 
noun is ﬁ rst or second person. Thus it cannot occur in the 
following:
Saya setinggi Ali.
I’m as tall as Ali.
Nor can it occur following tidak. Thus it cannot occur in the 
following:
Buku ini tidak semahal yang itu.
This book is not as expensive as that one.
The sama … -nya construction allows the two things being 
equated to be indicated in the same noun phrase. The se- 
construction cannot occur here:
John dan Ali sama pandainya.
John and Ali are as clever as each other/are equally clever.
In such constructions, where there is no qualiﬁ er, many speakers 
allow omission of -nya:
Mereka sama pandai.
They are equally clever.
If the head of the phrase is a compound, only sama … -nya can 
occur:
Tini sama lemah lembutnya dengan kakaknya.
Tini is as gentle as her older sister.
The modifying adverb hampir ‘almost’ can precede an equative 
construction with se-:
Dia hampir setinggi saya.
He’s almost as tall as me.

188 Phrases
Negated adjectives
An adjective preceded by paling ‘most’ and a number of modi-
fying adverbs (see 2.100) can be negated. Tidak occurs between 
paling or the modiﬁ er and the adjective:
Ini makanan yang paling tidak enak.
This is the most unpleasant food.
Cara itu sangat tidak manusiawi.
That method is very inhumane.
Organisasi itu dinilainya kian tidak eﬁ sien.
He judges that organisation as increasingly inefﬁ cient.
In such constructions only the adjective is negated. This is differ-
ent from negation of a whole adjective phrase when it occurs in 
the predicate of an adjective clause (see 3.9). In this case, tidak 
precedes the whole phrase:
Makanan ini tidak begitu enak.
This food isn’t very tasty.
Jasnya tidak terlalu besar.
His jacket isn’t too big.
Experiencer phrases
A prepositional phrase introduced by untuk, bagi or buat ‘for’ 
can follow the adjective to indicate who or what experiences the 
characteristic indicated by the adjective or from whose perspec-
tive the situation is viewed:
Ini aneh untuk saya.
This is strange for me.
A modifying adverb can precede the adjective:
Mobil ini terlalu besar buat kami.
This car is too big for us.
Udara di Jakarta makin tidak baik untuk paru-paru.
The air in Jakarta is increasingly bad for the lungs.
Frequently an adjective phrase containing an experiencer phrase 
occurs as the predicate of a clause whose subject begins with 
untuk (see 3.115). If the subject follows the predicate, which 
it usually does, the experiencer phrase takes bagi, to avoid the 
2.104
2.105

Numbers and number phrases 189
occurrence of a series of constructions beginning with untuk 
(another example occurs in section 3.115):
Sulit bagi kita untuk menurunkan harga.
It is difﬁ cult for us to lower prices.
If the subject does not begin with untuk, being a simple 
nominal clause (see 3.143), the experiencer phrase can begin 
with untuk:
Sulit untuk kami memperoleh bukti.
It is difﬁ cult for us to get proof.
NUMBERS AND NUMBER PHRASES
Numbers are either deﬁ nite or indeﬁ nite. The position of 
numbers within noun phrases is discussed in sections 2.14–20. 
In the following sections the internal structure of numbers is 
discussed. The only deﬁ nite numbers discussed here are cardinal 
numbers (see 2.107–12). Derived numbers are described in 
sections 1.145–63.
Cardinal numbers
Cardinal units are:
satu one
dua two
tiga three
empat four
lima ﬁ ve
enam six
tujuh seven
delapan eight
sembilan nine
Group numbers are:
puluh tens
belas teens
ratus hundreds
ribu thousands
juta millions
milyar billions
2.106
2.107

190 Phrases
Group numbers combine with one of the units. ‘One’ is se- 
except that with juta the full unit satu can occur and with 
milyar it must occur:
sepuluh ten
seribu one thousand
sejuta, satu juta one million
satu milyar one billion
Otherwise a full unit precedes the group number:
dua puluh twenty
tiga belas thirteen
empat ratus four hundred
Smaller numbers are expressed after larger numbers:
dua puluh satu twenty-one
seratus lima puluh one hundred and ﬁ fty
dua ribu enam ratus tiga puluh sembilan
two thousand six hundred and thirty-nine
When numbers are written with Arabic numerals a full stop, 
rather than a comma, is used to mark off each three placings:
(seribu) 1,000
2.30(dua juta tiga ratus ribu) 2,300,000
Fractions (see also 1.149) follow full numbers:
satu setengah one and a half
dua sepertiga two and a third
lima dua pertiga ﬁ ve and two-thirds
Saya sudah membaca dua setengah halaman.
I’ve read two and a half pages.
In decimal numbers, koma ‘comma’, equivalent to ‘point’ in 
English, and represented in writing by a comma, precedes the 
numerator:
dua koma tiga (2,3)
two point three (2.3)
satu koma satu juta (1,1 juta)
one point one million (1.1 million)
2.108
2.109

Numbers and number phrases 191
‘Nought, zero’ is nol, although in reading out lists of numerals, 
such as in telephone numbers, many people use kosong:
tiga nol dua/tiga kosong dua
three o two/three zero two (302)
Arithmetic phrases consist of two cardinal numbers sep arated 
by a word indicating an arithmetic operation:
enam tambah dua six plus two
sepuluh kurang lima ten minus ﬁ ve
tiga kali dua three times two
enam belas dibagi dua sixteen divided by two
Such phrases frequently occur as subject of a clause with sama 
dengan ‘equals’ (see 3.13).
Cardinal numbers can be preceded by a modiﬁ er, such as lebih 
dari ‘more than’:
Lebih dari sepuluh orang tewas dalam kecelakaan itu.
More than ten people died in the accident.
Modiﬁ ers of cardinal numbers include:
kira-kira, sekitar, kurang lebih about, more or less
hampir almost
sampai up to
genap fully
lebih dari more than
kurang dari less than
The last two modiﬁ ers in the above list can be negated:
 Tidak kurang dari satu juta orang menjadi pengecer 
Amway.
No less than one million people have become Amway retailers.
The modiﬁ er lebih can follow the number:
 Akuarium itu dapat menampung lima ribu lebih binatang 
laut.
 The aquarium can hold more than ﬁ ve thousand sea 
creatures.

192 Phrases
Indeﬁ nite numbers
Indeﬁ nite numbers include the following:
semua all
segala all
seluruh all of, whole of; all
segenap all
seantero the whole (of an area)
sebagian part of
tiap, setiap, tiap-tiap each, every
 banyak many (with count nouns); a lot, much (with non-
count nouns)
beberapa several
sedikit a little, few
bermacam-macam various, all sorts of
berbagai, pelbagai various
sejumlah a number of
kebanyakan most
salah satu, salah seorang one of
masing-masing each
aneka various, all sorts of
sembarang any (kind of), no particular
Some indeﬁ nite numbers, including banyak and sedikit, can 
take a modifying adverb (see 2.100):
banyak sekali orang very many people
terlalu sedikit gula too little sugar
Banyak is preceded by lebih ‘more’ before a noun where in 
English ‘more’ directly preceded the noun:
lebih banyak uang more money
Several indeﬁ nite numbers can be negated by tidak, including 
semua, seluruh, setiap, banyak, sedikit:
Tidak banyak orang yang senang pada dia.
Not many people like him.
Tidak semua orang bisa mengontrol marah seperti itu.
Not all people can control anger in that way.
2.113

Numbers and number phrases 193
Sembarang differs from other indeﬁ nite numbers in that it is 
negated by either bukan or tidak:
Ini bukan sembarang obat.
This is not just any medicine.
Tidak sembarang orang diundang.
Not just any old person was invited.
Several indeﬁ nite numbers can be pronominalised (see 2.95).
The indeﬁ nite number suatu ‘a, one’ is similar in function to 
sebuah (see 2.21). This usually occurs with abstract nouns:
suatu sistem/ide yang bagus/penyelidikan/pertemuan
a system/good idea/investigation/meeting
While suatu is sometimes used with concrete objects, (se)buah is 
sometimes used with abstract things; there is thus some overlap:
sebuah/suatu pondok/dialek/propinsi/kesimpulan
a hut/dialect/province/conclusion
However, unlike classiﬁ ers, suatu is inherently singular.
Suatu, but not sebuah, is also used with time words to form 
indeﬁ nite temporal phrases:
 suatu hari ‘one day’, suatu pagi ‘one morning’, suatu waktu 
‘one time’
The indeﬁ nite number masing-masing deserves some comment. 
It occurs before a noun—but after a pronoun (see 2.80)—with 
a similar meaning to tiap ‘each’, but emphasises the separateness 
of each of the people or things involved:
Masing-masing transmigran menerima sebidang tanah.
Each transmigrant received a plot of land.
It also occurs after a noun, where the separateness of each of the 
people or things referred to is caused by its correlation sep arately 
with someone or something mentioned elsewhere. In this case, 
it could also be regarded as following a possessive pronoun with 
the pronoun deleted:
2.114
2.115

194 Phrases
Mereka pulang ke rumah masing-masing.
They each returned to their own home.
Para sandera menelpon keluarga masing-masing.
Each of the hostages telephoned his (own) family.
Masing-masing can occur as an indeﬁ nite pronoun (see 2.96).
A special indeﬁ nite number is para. Used only with humans, 
para marks the noun as plural and referring to a particular 
group:
Jenazah para korban dibawa ke rumah sakit.
The bodies of the victims were taken to the hospital.
 Beginilah terungkapkan cinta dan kesetiaan terhadap para 
leluhur.
 In this way can be expressed love and faithfulness to the 
ancestors.
Para is used only with nouns indicating people having some 
characteristic in common, such as para guru ‘the teachers’, para 
nelayan ‘the ﬁ shermen’. It does not occur with generic nouns 
such as orang ‘person’, anak ‘child’, manusia ‘human’.
While satu-satunya ‘the only’ is not speciﬁ cally indeﬁ nite, it can 
be grouped with indeﬁ nite numbers:
Satu-satunya jembatan dari desa itu sudah rusak.
The only bridge from that village has been wrecked.
PREPOSITIONS AND PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and a noun 
phrase. The preposition links the following noun phrase to 
another component of the sentence. At the clause level, the 
preposition shows the relationship of the following noun phrase 
to the predicate.4
Locative prepositions
Among the most important prepositions are those which 
indicate position and direction. These are the locative 
2.116
2.117
2.118
2.119

Prepositions and prepositional phrases 195
prepositions. There are three basic locative prepositions: di, 
ke and dari. The ﬁ rst, di ‘in, at, on’, indicates that the action 
occurs in the place indicated by the following noun; there is no 
movement. Preposition ke ‘to’ indicates movement toward and 
dari ‘from’ indicates movement away:
Dia tinggal di kota.
He lives in the city.
Dia berjalan ke kota.
He walked to the city.
Dia berangkat dari kota.
He set off from the city.
These can combine with a set of locative pronouns, which 
indicate position in relation to the speaker. The locative 
pronouns are sini ‘here (near speaker)’, situ ‘there (not far off)’ 
and sana ‘there (far off)’. The combination of the three locative 
prepositions and three locative pronouns produces a nine-way 
distinction of location and direction, including:
di sini (at) here
ke situ to there (close)
dari sana from there (far)
The locative prepositions also combine with the question word 
mana ‘where’ (see 4.17).
The three locative prepositions also combine with a set of 
locative nouns which indicate location in relation to the follow-
ing noun. The locative nouns include:
atas top, above 
bawah beneath
depan front 
muka front
samping side 
dalam inside
antara between 
luar outside
tepi edge 
belakang back
seberang other side 
sebelah side
Examples in sentences are:
Dia muncul dari belakang rumah.
She appeared from behind the house.
2.120

196 Phrases
Di sebelah rumah ada pohon mangga.
At the side of the house there is a mango tree.
Mereka berenang ke seberang sungai.
 They swam to the other side of the river (They swam across 
the river).
The locative noun can be omitted from such constructions if 
it refers to a position which is normally understood; thus di 
laci for di dalam laci ‘in(side) the drawer’, di meja for di atas 
meja ‘on (top of) the table’. If, however, some other position 
is referred to, the locative noun is necessary: di bawah meja 
‘under the table’.
Locative nouns indicating ‘side’ can be made more speciﬁ c 
by such words as kanan ‘right’, kiri ‘left’, utara ‘north’ and 
so on:
di sebelah kiri rumah on the left side of the house
For many speakers di is omitted before a locative noun 
if ﬁ gurative space is referred to; in this case, the locative 
noun occurs alone as a preposition:
tokoh dalam cerita itu
the character in that story
perbedaan antara kedua kata itu
the difference between those two words
The locative preposition dari is also used for ﬁ gurative direc-
tion away:
Mereka melindungi anaknya dari tentara.
They protected their children from the army.
Jakarta mustahil dapat terbebas dari banjir.
It is impossible for Jakarta to be free from ﬂ oods.
Dari is also used to mean ‘from, made of’:
Puding ini terbuat dari agar-agar.
This pudding is made of agar-agar (seaweed-based) jelly.
When the following noun refers to a person, either ke or kepada 
‘to’ is used. Ke tends to occur in informal registers, whereas 
kepada is used mostly in formal registers:
2.121
2.122
2.123

Prepositions and prepositional phrases 197
Dia memberikan surat itu kepada ayahnya.
She gave the letter to her father.
Silakan kirim email ke saya.
 Please send me an email. (literally: ‘Please send an email 
to me.’)
Sometimes both ke and kepada are used by the same speaker 
without any apparent difference in meaning:
 Pak Yusril tidak minta maaf ke saya. Terhadap Marsilam 
pak Yusril meminta maaf, tetapi kepada saya tidak.
 Mr Yusril didn’t apologise to me. To Marsilam he apologised, 
but to me he didn’t.
Pada is sometimes used instead of kepada:
Berikan surat itu pada saya.
Give that letter to me.
 Mudah-mudahan Allah memberikan karuniaNya 
pada saya.
 Hopefully God gives me His blessings. (literally: ‘Hopefully 
God gives His blessings to me.’)
Like kepada, pada predominantly occurs in formal registers. 
Both of these prepositions are seldom used in informal 
conversation.
The word pada is usually used instead of di when location in 
time is referred to:
Dia datang pada jam tiga.
He came at three o’clock.
Kami akan berangkat pada tanggal dua.
We will leave on the second.
However, there is an increasing tendency for di to be used for 
some references to time, including before the words hari ‘day’, 
bulan ‘month’, tahun ‘year’ followed by a proper noun, although 
some people regard use of di here as substandard:
pada/di bulan Desember in December
2.124

198 Phrases
Muhammadiyah lahir di awal abad 20 yang lalu.
 Muhammadiyah was formed at the beginning of the 20th 
century.
 Di awal abad 19, Hong Kong hanyalah pelabuhan kecil 
dengan penduduk berjumlah ribuan.
 At the beginning of the 19th century, Hong Kong was only a 
small port with a few thousand people.
Besides pada and di, dalam may also be used for references to 
time. In this case, dalam indicates that an event occurs within a 
certain period or that a state pertains during that period.
Kapal itu tenggelam pada/di/dalam tahun 1985.
The ship sank in 1985.
Lamaran diterima dalam minggu ini.
Applications are accepted this week.
Rupiah dalam pekan ini kembali melemah.
Rupiah weakened again this week.
Besides its use in reference to time, pada is used in other contexts 
of ﬁ gurative space:
Saya tertarik pada pelajaran itu.
I’m interested in that subject.
Perubahan-perubahan itu terjadi pada semua bahasa.
Those changes occur in all languages.
The form kemari ‘(to) here’, as in Datang kemari! ‘Come here!’, 
is written as a single word because mari does not occur with the 
other locative prepositions; it means the same as ke sini.
Other prepositions
There are many prepositions apart from the locatives. A number 
occur in clause adjuncts, as discussed in sections 2.165ff. A few 
of the more common non-locative prepositions are:
untuk, bagi, guna, buat for
dengan with
tentang about, concerning
oleh by
sampai until
seperti like
tanpa without
2.125
2.126

Prepositions and prepositional phrases 199
Some prepositions are complex, including a preﬁ x:
terhadap towards
beserta together with
sesudah, setelah after
menjelang approaching (for time, events)
menuju toward
Some also function as verbs, as indicated in parentheses:
menurut according to (follow)
mengenai about, concerning (affect, concern)
lewat via (pass by)
A few consist of two words:
oleh karena because of, on account of
bersama dengan together with
 seiring dengan in accordance with (literally: ‘side by side
  with’)
sejalan dengan in parallel with
akibat dari as a result of
The forms kepada ‘to’ and daripada ‘than, of’ consist of two 
words written as one.
A number of words function both as conjunctions (see 4.69) 
and prepositions. As conjunctions they link a subordinate 
clause to the main clause in a sentence; as prepositions they 
link a noun phrase to the predicate. In the ﬁ rst example below, 
karena ‘because’ is a conjunction, followed by a subordinate 
clause; in the second it is a preposition followed by a noun 
phrase:
Dia tidak datang karena ayahnya meninggal.
He didn’t come because his father died.
Dia tidak datang karena kematian ayahnya.
He didn’t come because of the death of his father.
Among other words which can function as both preposition 
and conjunction are:
sebab because
sebelum before
2.127

200 Phrases

Not all Indonesian prepositions consistently translate one 
English preposition. The preposition terhadap illustrates the 
variety of correspondences which might occur. This does not 
result from any vagueness in the meaning of terhadap; the 
meaning ‘directed at’ is discernible in all these contexts:
sangsi terhadap orang yang melanggar kebiasaan
sanctions against people who violate custom
sikapnya terhadap tamu-tamunya
his attitude to/towards his guests
jengkel terhadap dirinya sendiri
annoyed at himself
perlakuan Iran terhadap para sandera
Iran’s treatment of the hostages
berminat terhadap sejarah
interested in history
perang terhadap perjudian
war on/against gambling
kemenangan terhadap Jepang
victory over Japan
kebencian terhadap mereka
hatred of/towards them
The preposition oleh ‘by’ marks the agent of a passive verb (see 
3.27) and the agent attribute in a noun phrase (see 2.53). It 
can sometimes follow an intransitive verb, in which case it can 
be regarded as a contraction of oleh karena ‘as a result of, 
because of’:
Ratusan juta orang akan tewas oleh ledakan, radiasi, 
wabah penyakit dan kelaparan.
Hundreds of millions of people will die as a result of 
ex plosions, radiation, epidemics and hunger.
2.128
2.129

The predicate phrase 201
It can sometimes occur with an adjective predicate, being 
syn onymous with dengan ‘with’:
Stadion penuh sesak oleh orang yang datang untuk 
menonton pertandingan.
The stadium was packed with people who had come to see 
the match.
If, however, dengan indicates instrument or means, oleh cannot 
alternatively occur:
Mereka bepergian dengan kapal laut.
They travelled by ship.
A number of intransitive verbs take a following prep osition, 
being equivalent in meaning to transitive verbs with sufﬁ x 
-i. These are further discussed in section 1.219. With some 
of these verbs there is considerable freedom as to which 
prepositions it can take. In particular, akan and pada are 
frequently interchangeable. The following are some examples:
cinta akan/pada love
percaya akan/pada believe in
kenal akan/dengan know, be acquainted with
curiga akan/pada/terhadap be suspicious of
Colloquially, sama can replace all the above prepositions.
 Tapi aku dari dulu percaya sama yang namanya reinkarnasi.
 But I have for a long time believed in what’s called 
reincar nation.
The preposition antara ‘between’ may be followed by 
coordinated noun phrases, in which case dengan is usually the 
coordinator. Examples are given in section 2.207.
THE PREDICATE PHRASE
The predicate is the essential component of every clause (see 3.4). 
A predicate phrase contains an obligatory predicate centre, which 
is a verb or one of a number of phrases, including noun phrase, 
adjective phrase and prepositional phrase. The predicate centre 
determines the type of clause, as discussed in section 3.4.
2.130
2.131
2.132

202 Phrases
In addition to the obligatory centre a predicate phrase may 
contain a number of other elements, including markers of time, 
modality, negation and reciprocity.
Negation
There are four negative words: bukan, tidak, belum and 
jangan. Belum ‘not yet’ combines the meanings of bukan/
tidak plus temporal marker sudah and is discussed in section 
2.156. Jangan ‘don’t’ occurs in imperative constructions and is 
discussed in section 4.35.
Bukan negates a noun; that is, it is used if the predicate centre 
contains a noun or noun phrase:
Dia bukan guru.
She isn’t a teacher.
Tidak negates all types of predicate other than nouns, including 
verbs, adjectives and prepositional phrases:
Mereka tidak menolong kami.
They didn’t help us.
Dia tidak di sini.
She isn’t here.
Hawa Bandung tidak terlalu panas.
The climate of Bandung is not too hot.
A number of prepositions, including karena ‘because’, untuk 
‘for’, seperti ‘like’, can be negated by either bukan or tidak:
Ini bukan/tidak untuk saudara.
These are not for you.
Penyakitnya bukan/tidak karena itu.
His illness is not because of that.
Ini bukan/tidak seperti desa kita.
This isn’t like our village.
Bukan can replace tidak. As such it is emphatic, implying that a 
contradictory statement could follow:
Dia bukan bodoh.
 He isn’t stupid (but there is another reason for his behaviour).
2.133
2.134
2.135
2.136
2.137

The predicate phrase 203
The contradiction can be expressed, for instance, as a clause 
beginning with melainkan ‘but rather’:
Dia bukan bodoh, melainkan malas saja.
He’s not stupid but just lazy.
Such constructions are discussed in section 4.84.
Several variants of tidak occur. Tak has a literary ﬂ avour for 
most Indonesians. It was once obligatory before ter- verbs (see 
1.272), although in modern Indonesian tidak is also common 
in this position:
Tak ada dosa yang tak terampuni.
There are no sins which cannot be forgiven.
Tiada is a literary form meaning the same as tidak ‘not’ and 
tidak ada ‘there isn’t’:
Aku tiada berkata begitu.
I did not say that.
Di daerah itu tiada air.
In that region there is no water.
With some verbs tidak can be replaced by kurang ‘less’ to 
indicate a lessened degree of negation or to soften the impact 
of the negation:
Aku kurang percaya akan kabar itu.
I didn’t really believe that news.
Both tidak and bukan can be emphasised by sama sekali 
‘(not) at all, deﬁ nitely (not)’ and sedikit pun ‘(not) even a 
little’:
Ini sama sekali bukan uang orang lain.
This is deﬁ nitely not other people’s money.
Saya sama sekali tidak tergantung pada dia.
I’m not in the least dependent on him.
Mereka sedikit pun tidak mempedulikan nasib orang lain.
 They don’t in the slightest care about the fate of other 
people.

204 Phrases
Tidak can occur in several phrases besides the predicate 
phrase, including adjective phrases (see 2.104), and with 
indeﬁ nite numbers (see 2.113). Bukan occurs as a sentence 
tag, irrespective of which negative would occur in the main 
clause (see 4.9). It also occurs in some correlative structures 
(see 4.83ff).
Temporal markers
In many languages, including English, it is necessary to specify 
when an action occurs in relation to the present or in relation 
to some other event, either in the form of the verb or with 
obligatory aspect markers (as in ‘ate’, ‘has eaten’, ‘had eaten’, 
etc.). In Indonesian the form of the verb does not change 
to indicate tense or aspect. A sentence such as Dia pergi ke 
kantor carries no indication of whether the verb refers to a 
regular occurrence or to a single occurrence and, if the latter, 
when it happens in relation to the present. This is inferred 
by listeners from the context within which the utterance 
is made.
Time can be indicated by adjuncts of time (see 2.182), such 
as setiap hari ‘every day’ and tadi pagi ‘this morning (past)’:
Dia pergi ke kantor setiap hari.
He goes to the ofﬁ ce every day.
Tadi pagi dia pergi ke kantor.
This morning he went to the ofﬁ ce.
Time can also be indicated by a set of temporal markers within 
the predicate. These indicate that the action has occurred, is 
occurring, or is yet to occur in relation to the moment of utter-
ance or in relation to some other event referred to.
In studies of Indonesian grammar these are usually referred 
to as ‘aspect markers’, indicating completeness or continuation 
of an action. Because of this interpretation akan ‘will’ is usually 
grouped apart, with modals or ‘auxiliary verbs’.
Sudah usually indicates that an action has occurred or that a 
state has been achieved:
Ali sudah bangun.
Ali has woken up.
2.141
2.142
2.143

The predicate phrase 205
Ali sudah sembuh.
Ali has recovered.
With verbs which indicate a state sudah usually refers both to 
the action which begins the state and to the continuation of the 
state:
Dia sudah tidur.
He has gone to bed/He is asleep.
Dia sudah duduk.
He has sat down/He is seated.
With such verbs, however, sudah can also indicate that the 
action is complete, context indicating which is meant:
Dia sudah tidur.
He has slept (and is now ready for work).
Sudah can occur with other predicates besides verbs, ‘already’ 
usually occurring in the English translation:
Dia sudah tinggi/di sini/guru.
He is already tall/here/a teacher.
Telah has the same meaning as sudah:
Dia telah pergi/makan.
He has gone/eaten.
The difference between the two is in register; telah is almost 
entirely conﬁ ned to writing and very formal speech, while 
sudah occurs in all registers from informal speech to the most 
formal styles.
Sedang indicates that an action is in progress, sometimes glossed 
‘in the process of’:
Mereka sedang makan.
They are eating.
Lagi and tengah can replace sedang, although they are less 
frequent and not used by all speakers:
Mereka lagi makan.
They are eating.
2.144
2.145
2.146

206 Phrases
 Sebuah kompleks apartemen mewah kini tengah dibangun 
di Jalan Satrio.
 A luxury apartment block is in the process of being built in 
Satrio Road.
Masih indicates that an action is still occurring:
Dia masih makan.
She is still eating.
Like sudah, it can occur with other predicate types:
Dia masih muda/di sini/pegawai.
She is still young/here/an employee.
Akan indicates a future event or state:
Kami akan makan nanti.
We will eat soon.
Tugasnya akan berat.
His task will be heavy.
Bakal indicates a future event. It is less common than akan and 
only refers to action a considerable time in the future. Thus 
it can replace akan in the sentence below but not in the two 
sentences illustrating akan in section 2.148:
Dia akan/bakal menjadi presiden.
He will become president.
It does not occur with other than verbal predicates. Where 
bakal precedes a noun it is part of the noun phrase, meaning 
‘prospective, future’: bakal presiden ‘future president’, bakal 
suami ‘future husband’.
Bakalan is also used to indicate a future event, but unlike 
bakal it cannot occur in a noun phrase:
Ratusan orang bakalan hadir dalam rapat tahunan itu.
 Hundreds of people are going to attend the annual meeting.
Baru indicates that an action has just occurred or a state has just 
been reached:
Dia baru tiba/mandi.
He has just arrived/bathed.
2.147
2.148
2.149
2.150

The predicate phrase 207
Umurnya baru empat tahun.
She’s just four years old.
Baru is often followed by saja for emphasis:
Dia baru saja tiba.
He’s only just arrived.
Pernah indicates that an action occurred in the far past. It cannot 
be used of recent events. It corresponds to ‘ever’, but unlike the 
English word it is not restricted to negative and interrogative 
sentences. It is also translatable as ‘once’:
Dia pernah belajar di Paris.
She once studied in Paris.
In examples in sections 2.143–51 temporal markers refer to 
time in relation to the moment of utterance. Time relative to 
another event may also be indicated. In the following examples 
the point of reference is an event in the past. Thus sudah and 
telah indicate that an action had occurred before another 
action, while sedang indicates that an action was in progress 
when another action occurred:
 Sebelum meninggal dia telah menceritakan riwayat 
hidupnya.
Before dying he had related his life story.
Ketika saya sampai di rumahnya Tom sudah bangun.
When I arrived at his house Tom had already got up.
Ketika saya sampai di rumahnya Tom sedang makan.
When I arrived at his house Tom was eating.
If the point of reference is the past, akan indicates that some-
thing was going to happen (although sometimes it does not 
occur), translatable as ‘would; was going to’:
Dia berjanji akan datang.
He promised he would come.
 Ketika akan menyerang Batavia, Sultan Agung lebih dulu 
mendirikan lumbung-lumbung padi di sepanjang jalan 
yang akan dilalui bala tentaranya.
 When he was going to attack Batavia, Sultan Agung ﬁ rst of 
all built rice barns along the road which his army was going 
to use.5

208 Phrases
Modals
Modals, often called auxiliary verbs in studies of Indo nesian, 
refer to such concepts as possibility, ability and necessity. 
Grammars of Indonesian vary considerably as to the words they 
place in this category, and not all modals function in precisely 
the same way. The main modals are:
dapat, bisa can, be able
boleh may, have permission
harus, mesti must
perlu must
mampu, sanggup able, have the capacity
sempat have the opportunity, have the time, be able
A number of other words usually grouped with modals, 
es pecially ingin and mau ‘want’, differ both grammatically and 
semantically from modals and are best treated as full verbs.
Modals usually occur with verbs:
Kamu boleh pergi tapi harus pulang sebelum jam lima.
You may go but you must come home before ﬁ ve o’clock.
Some modals can occur with adjectives and locatives:
Tidak banyak orang yang bisa dekat dengan Kim Jong Il.
Not many people are able to be close to Kim Jong Il.
Seorang polisi harus tinggi.
A policeman must be tall.
Saya harus ke sana.
I have to go there.
Combinations of negative, temporal marker and modal
Many combinations of negative, temporal and modal are 
possible. In general, the ﬁ rst to occur modiﬁ es the meaning 
of everything which follows within the predicate. In the ﬁ rst 
example below tidak modiﬁ es boleh hadir ‘may be present’, 
giving ‘not the case that (he) may be present’, while in the 
second example boleh expresses the possibility of tidak hadir 
‘not present’, giving ‘permissible (for him) not to be present’:
Dia tidak boleh hadir.
He is not allowed to be present.
2.153
2.154

The predicate phrase 209
Dia boleh tidak hadir.
He is allowed to be absent.
Pelamar tidak harus sudah menikah.
Applicants do not need to be married.
Pelamar harus belum menikah.
Applicants must not yet be married.
Sometimes a reversal of word order does not change meaning. 
Thus sudah harus and harus sudah both mean ‘must already’:
Kamu sudah harus di sini jam lima.
Kamu harus sudah di sini jam lima.
You must be here by ﬁ ve o’clock.
Not all combinations are possible and Indonesians differ in what 
they ﬁ nd acceptable. Some combinations, while occurring, are 
of very low frequency.
Two negatives may co-occur in the predicate. In the following 
example, the ﬁ rst tidak negates dapat. This combination in 
turn modiﬁ es tidak terkena ‘not subject to’, giving ‘cannot be 
the case that (it) is not subject to’. In the second example, tidak 
negates tak terbatas ‘unlimited’:
 Bahasa Indonesia tidak dapat tidak terkena hukum 
perubahan.
 Indonesian cannot avoid being subject to the laws 
of change.
Kekuasaan kepala negara tidak tak terbatas.
The powers of a head of state are not unlimited.
Belum ‘not yet’ combines the meanings of bukan/tidak plus 
temporal marker sudah:
Dia belum professor.
He isn’t a professor yet.
Mereka belum berangkat.
They haven’t left yet.
Sudah can precede tidak and bukan, the combination indi-
cating that what follows is no longer the case. Lagi (see 2.161) 
frequently occurs also:
2.155
2.156

210 Phrases
Karena asap menara pengendali sudah tidak terlihat lagi.
 Because of the smoke the control tower could no longer 
be seen.
Dia sudah bukan pembantu lagi.
She is no longer a servant.
For many speakers, negatives do not combine with sedang, 
masih and baru, although tidak can precede akan and pernah:
Mereka tidak pernah pergi ke bioskop.
They never go to the movies.
Dia tidak akan datang.
He won’t come.
The combination belum pernah is equivalent to the negative 
of sudah pernah and thus differs from tidak pernah, as in the 
following examples:
Saya belum pernah pergi ke sana.
I have never been there.
Saya tidak pernah pergi ke sana.
I never go there.
There are only a few combinations of temporals, usually involv-
ing akan:
Apakah dia akan pernah mendapat pekerjaan?
Will he ever get work?
The combination sudah akan means ‘about to’ when referring 
to the past. Referring to the future, sudah akan and akan sudah 
both mean ‘will have (done the action)’:
Dia sudah akan setuju tadi.
He was about to agree just now.
Kami akan sudah selesai kalau anda kembali jam lima.
We will already be ﬁ nished if you come back at ﬁ ve.
 Saya yakin dalam beberapa hari lagi surat anda sudah akan 
sampai.
I am sure that in a few days your letter will have arrived.
The combination akan pernah and pernah akan can be 
negated:
2.157
2.158

The predicate phrase 211
Situasi itu tidak akan pernah timbul.
That situation will never arise.
A combination of two modals always includes harus ‘must’:
Australia harus dapat meyakinkan mitra dagangnya.
Australia must be able to convince its trading partners.
Combinations of temporal and modal are common:
Itulah yang masih harus dibuktikan.
That’s what still has to be proved.
Dia bakal mampu menaklukkan mereka.
He will be able to defeat them.
Some combinations of negative, temporal and modal occur:
Partai itu tidak akan bisa membentuk pemerintahan.
That party will not be able to form a government.
Saling
Before a verb saling marks reciprocal action. It can occur 
with any verb which allows a human object. As with verbs 
having reciprocal afﬁ xation (see 1.248 and 1.255), an object 
does not occur. The English translation has ‘each other’ as 
object:
Mereka saling mengenal/memaafkan/mengunjungi.
They know/forgive/visit each other.
Several -i verbs (see 1.212ff) optionally drop the sufﬁ x in the 
presence of saling:
 Mereka saling mengingkar/mencinta. (cf. Dia menging-
kari/mencintai istrinya.)
They betray/love each other. (cf. He betrays/loves his wife.)
Saling can occur redundantly with reciprocal verbs (see 1.251).
Kembali and lagi
The predicate centre can be followed by kembali or lagi. Both 
mean ‘again’; kembali also has the meaning ‘return to former 
state’. (Occurring before the predicate lagi is a temporal marker 
meaning ‘in the process’—see 2.146).
2.159
2.160
2.161

212 Phrases
Anak itu menangis lagi.
That child is crying again.
Koran yang dibredel sudah terbit kembali.
The banned newspaper has reappeared.
The combination of a negative and lagi means ‘no longer, not 
any more’ (see also 2.156):
Dia bukan guru lagi.
She’s no longer a teacher.
For speakers from some regions, the combination of belum and 
lagi means ‘not yet’:
Saya belum lapar lagi.
I’m not hungry yet.
REFLEXIVE PHRASES
A reﬂ exive phrase consists minimally of reﬂ exive pronoun diri 
‘self’. A minimal reﬂ exive phrase usually occurs as the object of 
a verb and indicates that the object is the same person as the 
subject of the verb:
Kamu harus menjaga diri baik-baik.
You must look after yourself properly.
Tuan rumah memperkenalkan diri kepada kami.
The host introduced himself to us.
Kami mengabdikan diri kepada tanah air.
We devote ourselves to the nation.
Sometimes a transitive verb followed by diri occurs where 
English uses an intransitive verb:
Penjahat itu melarikan diri.
The criminal ﬂ ed.
Perdana menteri mengundurkan diri.
The prime minister resigned.
Other examples of this formation where English uses an intran-
sitive verb are the following; in some cases an intransitive verb 
can also occur, as indicated:
meloloskan diri/lolos escape
2.162
2.163

Reﬂ exive phrases 213
menarik diri withdraw
mencalonkan diri stand (for ofﬁ ce)
mengkhususkan diri specialise (in a certain ﬁ eld)
menyerahkan diri/menyerah surrender
When membunuh ‘kill’ occurs with diri, preﬁ x meN- is usually 
lost: bunuh diri ‘commit suicide’.
The full reﬂ exive phrase is diri + possessive pronoun + sendiri. 
Third person -nya corresponds to a plural as well as a singular 
third person subject:
dirinya sendiri himself/herself/themselves
Either the possessive pronoun or sendiri can be omitted. The 
addition of either is more emphatic than diri alone; occurrence 
of sendiri makes the phrase particularly emphatic:
Kasim menganggap dirinya lain dari orang lain.
Kasim considers himself different from other people.
Sekarang anda pasti sudah mempersiapkan diri anda.
Now you have certainly prepared yourself.
 Tidak ada orang lain yang menghargaiku sebagai manusia. 
Karena itu aku harus menghargai diriku sendiri.
 No one else respects me as a person. Because of that I must 
respect myself.
Dia gemar mencandai dirinya sendiri.
He’s fond of joking at himself.
If the object is a bahwa clause (see 3.109) a reﬂ exive phrase still 
occurs, whether bahwa is present or omitted (English does not 
use a reﬂ exive if corresponding ‘that’ occurs):
Dia menyatakan dirinya bukan familiku lagi.
He declared himself no longer a relative of mine.
 Mereka percaya bahwa dirinya lebih unggul dari orang lain.
They believe that they are superior to other people.
A reﬂ exive phrase can also follow a preposition if it refers to the 
same person as the actor (the subject of an active clause or the 
agent of a passive clause). Following a preposition, diri cannot 
occur alone:
2.164

214 Phrases
Dia jengkel terhadap dirinya sendiri.
He is annoyed at himself.
Kata-kata itu saya tujukan kepada diri saya sendiri.
I directed those words at myself.
 Narkotika itu dia beli tak hanya untuk pasien tapi juga 
untuk dirinya sendiri.
 He bought those narcotics not only for the patients but also 
for himself.
Sometimes a reﬂ exive phrase is used instead of a personal 
pronoun even though the action is not reﬂ exive; that is, the 
reﬂ exive phrase does not identify the same person as the actor. 
This is usually done for emphasis (although sometimes the 
speaker may be confused as to whether the action is reﬂ exive 
or not):
 Dia menolak untuk diperiksa mengenai tuduhan-tuduhan 
terhadap dirinya.
He refused to be examined on the charges against him.
 Saya siap menghadapi hukuman apa pun yang akan 
dijatuhkan atas diri saya.
I am prepared to face any punishment which befalls me.
A phrase consisting of diri followed by a noun, meaning some-
thing like ‘the person of [noun]’, can occur in a non-reﬂ exive 
context:
Dia akan menulis buku tentang diri Presiden.
He is going to write a book about the President.
 Raksasa itu melambangkan nafsu-nafsu jahat dalam diri 
manusia.
The giant symbolises the evil passions within humans.
The reﬂ exive phrase can be subject of a passive clause (see 
3.40).
ADJUNCTS
Adjuncts are components of a clause which give infor mation 
about such matters as place, time, frequency and manner. 
Adjuncts may be single words, prepositional phrases (see 
2.165

Adjuncts 215
2.118ff) or other phrase types. Adjuncts are often called adverbs 
or adverbials, although here the word ‘adverb’ is restricted to 
adjuncts of manner.
There is a great variety of adjuncts, of which only the most 
frequent can be dealt with in the following sections. In addition 
to adjuncts which give information that applies to the clause 
in general, there are other adjuncts, called focusing adjuncts, 
which focus on a particular element in the clause. These are 
discussed in sections 2.216–26.
Adverbs
Adverbs are a subgroup of adjuncts which give infor mation about 
the manner in which an action is performed. They are sometimes 
called adverbs of manner. Many adverbs are based on adjec-
tives and are usually translated by an adjective with sufﬁ x -ly in 
English. There are several ways in which adverbs are derived from 
adjectives, as described in the following sections. Some adverbs 
are not based on adjectives, and these are also described below. 
Where the derivation involves afﬁ xation, adverbs are described in 
Chapter 1 (see 1.136 and 1.142).
Adjectives used directly as adverbs
A few adjectives can be used directly as adverbs without a prep-
osition or reduplication:
Kami bekerja keras.
We work hard.
Mereka akan mudah mencari pekerjaan.
They will get work easily.
Adverbs formed with dengan
Many adverbs of manner are phrases consisting of dengan 
followed by an adjective or adjective phrase:
 Pebulutangkis itu melompati net dengan gembira setelah 
mengalahkan lawannya.
 The badminton player jumped the net with glee after defeat-
ing her opponent. 
 Jumlah penduduk di kota Jakarta menanjak dengan cepat 
sekali.
Jakarta’s population is rising very quickly.
2.166
2.167
2.168

216 Phrases
 Amerika dengan tegas mengingatkan dunia akan kemam-
puannya.
America forcefully reminded the world of its strength.
While many adjectives can be adverbialised by placing dengan 
before them a few cannot, including aneh ‘strange’, benar ‘true’, 
bodoh ‘stupid’, lucu ‘funny’. However, there is considerable vari-
ation between what different people regard as acceptable.
The sufﬁ x -nya can optionally occur on the adjective:
Hujan turun dengan derasnya.
The rain fell heavily.
Adverbs formed with secara
Some adjectives can be adverbialised by placing secara before 
them:
Mereka hidup secara sederhana.
They live simply.
Topeng dapat dibuat secara mudah.
Masks can be made easily.
 Dia tidak mengatakan pemikirannya dan sikapnya secara 
jujur.
He did not state his thinking and attitude honestly.
Adverbs formed with secara are not based solely on adjectives. 
They can be based on verbs acting adjectivally, as discussed in 
section 2.98, and also on some verbs which do not act as adjec-
tives and on other word classes:
 Manusia hidup berdampingan dengan serangga secara 
menguntungkan.
Humans live side by side with insects proﬁ tably.
Mereka mengundang penelitian ilmiah secara terbuka.
The openly invite scientiﬁ c inspection.
 Plaza ini secara berkala digunakan untuk maksud-maksud 
komersial.
This plaza is used periodically for commercial purposes.
Kasus itu diusut secara hukum.
The case was investigated legally.
Secara pribadi Moerdiono ikut protes.
Privately Moerdiono joined the protest.
2.169

Adjuncts 217
The adjective following secara can be negated:
 Pernyataan itu secara tidak langsung mengesampingkan 
anggota PLO.
The statement indirectly ignores the PLO members.
 Dia dituduh bergaul secara tidak senonoh dengan wanita 
itu.
He was accused of associating immorally with the woman.
Reduplicated adjectives
Some adverbs consist of reduplicated adjectives:
Habiskan nasimu cepat-cepat!
Finish your rice quickly!
Kakinya diikat erat-erat.
His feet were bound tightly.
Penyakit itu betul-betul dapat disembuhkan.
The disease can really be cured.
Dia diam-diam meninggalkan istana.
He quietly left the palace.
Some adverbs can be derived from adjectives either by use of 
dengan or reduplication, although their number is limited:
Sofyan berteriak keras-keras/dengan keras.
Sofyan screamed loudly.
Other adverbs
A small group of adverbs consist of a negative followed by  redu-
plicated adjective base plus -nya. These indicate that the quality 
or state speciﬁ ed by the reduplicated form is never reached, often 
translating ‘without ever getting [base]’. The following examples 
are based on putus ‘broken, interrupted’, jemu ‘tired’ and jera 
‘wary, having learned one’s lesson’ respectively:
Dengan mereka raja tak putus-putusnya bercanda.
With them the king incessantly cracked jokes.
Dia bekerja tidak jemu-jemunya.
He works tirelessly.
Belum jera-jeranya Salim mencuri.
 Salim steals undaunted (not having learned from past 
experience).

2.171
2.172

218 Phrases
Others in this group include:
tidak puas-puasnya without ever getting enough
tidak bosan-bosannya without ever getting bored
tidak sembuh-sembuhnya without ever recovering
The verb base henti ‘cease’, with optional preﬁ x ber-, also occurs 
in this construction:
Paman saya tak (ber)henti-hentinya merokok.
My uncle smokes incessantly.
Adverbs derived by reduplication of the adjective with 
afﬁ xation se-…-nya are discussed with examples in section 
1.136.
In this group are a few set expressions consisting of se- plus 
adjective plus noun, such as sepuas hati ‘to one’s heart’s content’ 
and sekuat tenaga ‘with all one’s strength’:
Kamu boleh bermain sepuas hati.
You can play to your heart’s content.
The forms described in section 1.136 can be replaced by a 
construction in which the reduplication and -nya are replaced 
by mungkin ‘possible’:
 Dia memukul temannya sekeras-kerasnya/sekeras mungkin.
He hit his friend as hard as possible.
Kita harus berangkat selekas-lekasnya/selekas mungkin.
We must leave as soon as possible.
Words which rarely or never occur as adjectives tend to function 
adverbally without reduplication or a preceding preposition, 
such as terus-menurus ‘continuous’, asyik ‘busy’, serentak 
‘in unison, at the same time’ (of a number of people acting 
together), sekaligus ‘together, at the same time (of action done 
to several things at once)’:
Hujan turun terus-menerus.
Rain fell continuously.
Tetangganya asyik bekerja di sawah.
His neighbours were busily working in the ﬁ elds.
Semua orang serentak berdiri.
All the people stood up together.
2.173
2.174
2.175

Adjuncts 219
Dia minum semua tablet sekaligus.
He took all the tablets at once.
Others in this group include:
segera immediately
langsung directly, immediately
terus continuously
tetap permanently
mutlak unconditionally
The words begini, seperti ini ‘like this, in this way’, begitu, 
demikian, seperti itu ‘like that’ are adverbs of manner:
Mengapa mereka dihina begitu?
Why were they humiliated like that?
Setiap tahun ribuan hektar tanah menghilang begini.
 Every year thousands of hectares of land are lost in this 
way.
A set of manner adverbs based on numbers indicate the number 
of people or things involved together in the action. Redupli-
cated numbers can occur alone (see 1.25 for examples) or with 
preﬁ x ber- (see 1.160 for examples). Alternatively, the numbers 
can be separated by demi or per:
Mereka keluar dua demi dua.
They came out two by two.
Satu per satu para terdakwa dijatuhi hukuman penjara.
One by one the accused were sentenced to jail.
The phrase sedikit demi sedikit ‘little by little’ can also be 
grouped here.
Other manner adverbs based on numbers are described in 
sections 1.158–60 and 1.163.
The adverbs sendirian, seorang diri and, colloquially, sendiri 
(see 2.51) mean ‘by oneself, alone’:
 Anak itu bermain sendirian/seorang diri/sendiri di 
taman.
The child played alone in the park.
2.176
2.177
2.178

220 Phrases
The reduplicated form sendiri-sendiri means ‘apart, sepa-
rately’:
Mereka memasak sendiri-sendiri.
They cook separately.
Both sendiri and the phrase dengan sendirinya mean ‘auto-
matically, by itself, of its own accord’ when referring to action 
by an inanimate subject:
Lemari itu terbuka sendiri.
The cupboard opened by itself.
Batu ginjal keluar dengan sendirinya.
The kidney stone came out by itself.
As adverbs of manner, ramai and banyak are restricted to 
preceding certain passive verbs to indicate that the action is 
performed by a great many people:
Pasar Lewolebo ramai dikunjungi oleh para pedagang.
The Lewolebo market is visited by large numbers of traders.
Adjuncts of time
An adjunct of time can be a noun phrase, a prepositional phrase 
or a word. Adjuncts can indicate both speciﬁ c time and relative 
time.
Speciﬁ c time does not make reference to the time of utter-
ance. Speciﬁ c times can be clock times, days of the week, months, 
years and dates.
Relative time indicates when an action or state occurs in 
relation to the present or some other event. It can be indicated 
by a temporal marker within the predicate (see 2.142), by a 
subordinate clause of time (see 4.70) or by an adjunct of time 
within the clause.
Clock times
These are usually expressed in terms of hours and minutes or 
parts of an hour. The number indicating the hour is preceded 
by jam or pukul ‘o’clock’:
jam dua two o’clock
pukul lima ﬁ ve o’clock
2.179
2.180
2.181
2.182
2.183

Adjuncts 221
There are several ways of indicating minutes or parts of the 
hour. For minutes after the hour and before the half hour, the 
minute is preceded by lebih ‘more’ or lewat ‘past’. The word 
menit ‘minute’ may follow:
jam sembilan lebih sepuluh
ten past nine
pukul lima lewat dua puluh menit
twenty minutes past ﬁ ve
For expressing the half hour, setengah ‘half’ is used before the 
number of the following full hour. The word jam/pukul is 
frequently omitted:
(jam) setengah tiga half past two
Between the half hour and the following full hour minutes are 
subtracted, the minute being preceded by kurang ‘less’:
jam empat kurang delapan (menit)
eight (minutes) to four
For quarter hours, seperempat ‘one quarter’ is used as an alter-
native to lima belas (menit):
jam lima lebih seperempat/jam lima lebih lima belas
a quarter past ﬁ ve
 pukul dua kurang seperempat/pukul dua kurang lima 
belas menit
a quarter to two
It is common, particularly in informal speech, to simply place 
the minute after the hour. With this system, counting always 
precedes forward to the full hour:
jam enam tiga puluh six thirty
jam dua empat puluh two forty
Parts of the day, pagi ‘morning until about ten’, siang ‘between 
about ten and four’, sore ‘between about four and six’ and 
malam ‘night’ can follow the time, equivalent to ‘a.m., in the 
morning’ and so on:
jam lima pagi ﬁ ve o’clock in the morning
jam tujuh malam seven at night

222 Phrases
In formal contexts, a twenty-four hour clock is used. The time 
is always preceded by pukul and minutes are counted forward 
to the full hour:
pukul delapan belas tiga puluh
eighteen thirty hours (six thirty p.m.)

Years
The name of a year is expressed either by stating it as a cardinal

separately. The number is preceded by tahun ‘year’. Thus ‘1994’ 
is expressed in either of the following ways:
tahun seribu sembilan ratus sembilan puluh empat
tahun sembilan belas sembilan puluh empat
nineteen ninety-four
If the part referring to the century is stated separately the group

Eras can be expressed by placing Sebelum Masehi ‘before 
Christ’, abbreviated to SM ‘BC’ in writing, or Masehi ‘(after) 
Christ’, abbreviated to M ‘AD’ in writing, after the year:

speciﬁ c time (see 2.124):

However, pada can be omitted:
Toko ini buka (pada) jam tujuh.

September.
Mr Siagian moved to Surabaya on the ﬁ fth/in September.
Phrases with pada can contain a word which indicates which 
part of the time period is being referred to, including awal 
‘beginning’, pertengahan ‘middle’ and akhir ‘end’:
pada awal tahun delapan puluhan
at the beginning of the nineteen eighties
In some contexts di can occur instead of pada (see 2.124), and 
like pada, di can also be omitted:
 Band yang terbentuk di pertengahan tahun 2008 itu 
dinamai ‘Kredo’.
 This band, which was formed in the middle of 2008, is called 
‘Kredo’.
Insiden itu terjadi awal tahun lalu.
The incident occurred at the beginning of last year.
Other prepositions occurring in time adjuncts include:
sebelum before

There are a great many words, phrases and expressions indicat-
ing relative time, only a few of which are listed here.
Some adjuncts of time indicate time relative to the present, 
while others can indicate time relative either to the present or to 
some other event. Adjuncts of time include:
sekarang now
kini now, nowadays
dulu, dahulu earlier, previously
kemudian afterwards
akhir-akhir ini recently
baru-baru ini recently
mula-mula at ﬁ rst
akhirnya ﬁ nally
sebentar lagi in a moment

2.191

226 Phrases
Kelak saya ingin punya banyak anak.
Later I want to have lots of children.
Phrases with hari ‘day’, bulan ‘month’ and so on can combine 
with ini ‘this’:
hari ini today
bulan ini this month
They can also combine with (yang) lalu ‘past’ and depan (yang) 
akan datang ‘next’:
tahun lalu last year
minggu depan/yang akan datang next week
These can occur with a number:
dua minggu lalu two weeks ago
beberapa tahun yang lalu several years ago
Referring to time relative to some other event, these expressions 
can be expanded in numerous ways:
beberapa jam sesudah itu several hours after that
dua hari kemudian two days later
keesokan harinya the following day
Adjuncts of time also refer to speciﬁ c days before or after the 
present, optionally followed by an indication of the part of 
the day:
kemarin yesterday
kemarin dulu the day before yesterday
besok tomorrow
lusa in two days’ time
kemarin pagi yesterday morning
While nanti and tadi can occur alone as adjuncts of relative 
time (see 2.191), they can also occur with nouns identifying 
parts of the day to indicate past or future within the twenty-four 
hour period; they can occur either before or after the noun for 
the time period, expressions with the adjunct last being more 
formal:
2.192
2.193
2.194

Adjuncts 227
tadi malam, malam tadi last night
tadi pagi, pagi tadi this morning
nanti sore, sore nanti this evening
The only combination not possible is that of nanti and pagi. For 
‘tomorrow morning’ besok pagi is used. Tadi is used after the 
period of the day referred to is past, nanti if the period has not yet 
arrived. Thus, if it is still morning at the moment of utterance the 
phrase pagi ini ‘this morning’ is used, rather than tadi pagi.
The periods of the day can be reduplicated to form adjuncts 
of time. Thus pagi-pagi ‘early in the morning’ from pagi 
‘morning’:
Kita harus berangkat pagi-pagi.
We must set off early in the morning.
The other forms in this group are:
siang-siang not too late in the day, at daylight
sore-sore late in the day, early in the evening
malam-malam late at night
Siang-siang polisi merazia tempat judi.
The police raided a gambling place at daylight.
Jangan tidur sore-sore.
Don’t go to bed too early.

occurs, as illustrated by berkali-kali ‘repeatedly’ and jarang 
‘rarely’:
Dia sudah berkali-kali dipanggil.
He’s already been called repeatedly.
Ia jarang datang kemari.
She rarely comes here.
Other adjuncts of frequency include:
kadang-kadang sometimes
sekali-sekali occasionally, now and then

2.196

228 Phrases
 sering, sering kali, kerap, kerap kali, acap kali frequently, 
often
selalu, senantiasa always
berulang kali, berulang-ulang repeatedly
biasanya usually
umumnya usually, generally
The phrase tidak pernah ‘never’ occurs within the predicate

modifying adverbs mentioned in section 2.100:
Jarang sekali mereka makan di rumah.
They very rarely eat at home.
Makin sering mereka bertengkar.
They argue more and more frequently.
Numbers can occur with kali ‘times’ to indicate how many times 
the action occurs:

These expressions can be expanded to indicate how often within 
a certain time period the action occurs:
Dia menulis kepada istrinya dua kali seminggu.
He writes to his wife twice a week.

We hold a meeting once a month.
Sekali ‘once’ can occur after indication of the time period:

sentence.
The time period within which the event has occurred that many 
times can also be mentioned:
untuk kedua kali bulan ini
for the second time this month
A time period with preﬁ x se- (see 1.146) occurs alone to indicate 
that the action is done by a certain number of people or to a 
certain number of people or things once in such a period; the 
number is mentioned in the phrase identifying the people or 
things:
 Lebih dari delapan ribu turis mengunjungi pulau itu 
sebulan.

2.200
2.201

Nouns indicating a period of time can be reduplicated 
and preﬁ xed with ber- to indicate duration of an indeﬁ nite

be followed by lamanya ‘long (of time)’ or preceded by sejak 
‘since’:

Berjam-jam lamanya saya berusaha.
I’ve been trying for hours.

Sejak can be preceded by sudah to emphasise the span between 
a past time and the moment of utterance:

Sejak is sometimes used to mean ‘from’:
 Sejak berusia beberapa bulan bayi sudah mampu memu-
tuskan akan bergaul dengan siapa.
 From a few months of age, a baby is already able to decide 
whom to socialise with.
Sentences with sudah occurring within the predicate (see 2.143) 
can also be followed by sejak as a time adjunct:

 It seems that they have been following me since I was in 
Jakarta.
Untuk ‘for’ and selama ‘for, during’ can be omitted, as in the

2.205

232 Phrases
Saya membaca sampai/hingga halaman tiga puluh.
I read up to page thirty.
Kami berjalan kaki sampai desa Jatisari.

There are a number of combinations of such prepositions with 
adjuncts of time (see 2.191) and with some conjunctions, such 
as sementara ‘meanwhile’:
Hingga kini mereka belum mengambil tindakan.
Until now they haven’t taken action.

A measurement noun phrase (see 2.30) can also indicate the 
distance of the event from something else:

There are several combinations of prepositional phrases 
which indicate the time or distance within which the action 
occurs.

followed by another prepositional phrase with sampai, sampai 
dengan, hingga ‘until, up to’:

Location
Adjuncts of location state where an event occurs. With verbs of 
motion they also refer to source and direction. These adjuncts are 
mostly prepositional phrases, discussed in sections 2.118–25.
Instrument and means
Adjuncts of instrument and means indicate a device or method 
used to carry out something. The preposition is dengan ‘with; 
by’:

2.210

234 Phrases
Dia pergi ke Medan dengan istrinya.
He went to Medan with his wife.

I holidayed in Bali together with my family.
Occurring by itself, bersama ‘together’ indicates that the subject 
phrase refers to a number of people acting together:
Kami berangkat bersama.
We set off together.
Beneﬁ ciary
The adjunct indicates for whose beneﬁ t the action is performed. 
Prepositions are untuk, bagi, buat ‘for’ (see also 1.206–7 for 
examples):
 Perlakuan istimewa dicadangkan untuk/buat/bagi para 
pengusaha.
Special treatment is reserved for business people.
Phrases with preposition demi ‘for, for the sake of’ can also be

2.211
2.212

Adjuncts 235
Comparison
These adjuncts indicate that the subject is like some other person 
or thing in a characteristic or manner of doing something. These 
constructions are prepositional phrases. Prep ositions include 
seperti, bagai, sebagaimana, bagaikan, ibarat, laksana:
 Dia berjalan tergesa-gesa seperti orang yang dikejar 
hantu.
He walked hurriedly like a person pursued by a ghost.
Gigi di mulutnya kuat bagaikan baja.
The teeth in its mouth are strong like steel.
Exception
The preposition kecuali ‘except’ indicates who or what is not 
included in the action:
Tidak ada orang yang membantu dia kecuali ayahnya.
No one helped him except his father.
Subject matter
Preposition tentang ‘about’ indicates that the action concerns a 
particular subject or topic:
Menlu memberi keterangan tentang peristiwa itu.
The foreign minister gave an explanation about the matter.
More formally, mengenai ‘about, concerning’ can occur.
Focusing adjuncts
Focusing adjuncts identify the most important thing 
involved in what is being said. There are several types. Particle 
pun is also here included among the focusing adjuncts 
(see 2.221). The foregrounding particles -lah and -kah are 
discussed separately, -lah in sections 3.51–3 and -kah in 
sections 4.23–6.
Limiters
Limiters restrict what is said to the part of the clause on which 
attention is focused. Most limiters, including hanya, cuma, 
semata-mata ‘only’, precede the predicate. The focused item can 
vary depending on which word is given stress. In the following 
example, focus would normally be on the fact that nothing was 
2.213
2.214
2.215
2.216
2.217

236 Phrases
eaten except bread. However, if makan ‘eat’ receives stress, the 
sentence can indicate that the only thing done to the bread was 
that it was eaten:
Tadi pagi saya hanya makan roti.
This morning I only ate bread.
The limiters saja and melulu ‘just’ follow the focused item:
Tadi pagi saya makan roti saja.
This morning I just ate bread.
Hanya and saja can combine to give additional emphasis:
Dia hanya makan roti saja.
He ate nothing but bread.
Some limiters restrict what is said particularly or mainly to 
the part of the clause focused, including terutama ‘especially, 
particularly’ (see also 2.63) and khususnya ‘in particular’:
Kenaikan pendapatan itu terutama berasal dari pajak.
The rise in income in particular comes from taxes.
Additives
Juga and pula ‘also, too, as well’ indicate that the focused part 
is an addition. The focused item can vary depending on what 
is given stress. Thus in the following example the focused item, 
the addition, may be saya ‘I’ (as well as someone else), makan 
‘eat’ (as well as the performance of some other action, such as 
cooking), nasi ‘rice’ (as well as other food):
Saya makan nasi juga.
I eat rice too.
Justru
Justru emphasises that a particular component of the clause is 
the case rather than any other possibility, this being contrary to 
what the listener might expect. Justru, translatable ‘precisely’, 
usually precedes the focused component, always doing so if it 
occurs last in the clause:
Yang mengeluh justru Garuda.
It was precisely Garuda which complained.
2.218
2.219
2.220

Adjuncts 237
Film-ﬁ lmnya menjadi besar justru karena tema kecil.
 His movies became big precisely because of their small 
themes.
Otherwise, justru sometimes follows the focused element and is 
translatable ‘the very one’ or ‘precisely’:
 Di perusahaan semacam ini pegawai yang baik justru 
menjadi bulan-bulanan ﬁ tnah.
 In businesses like this good employees are the very ones who 
become the targets of slander.
 Saya datang ke sini karena saya justru melihat kemungki-
nan di desa ini.
 I came here precisely because I saw the possibilities in this 
village.
Particle pun
Particle pun acts as a focusing adjunct in some of its functions. It 
can also act like a linking adjunct, as discussed in section 2.222. 
Whatever its function, pun always follows the subject of the clause 
and acts to emphasise it. Except when it occurs in conjunctions 
(see 2.226) pun is written as a separate word, although some 
people will write it attached to the pre ceding word.
Saya pun mau pergi kalau diberi tiket gratis.
I’d go too if given a free ticket.
One major function of pun is to indicate that some additional 
information goes beyond expectations, translatable as ‘even’:
 Bahan-bahan pangan menjadi mahal dan untuk memper-
olehnya pun sangat susah.
 Foodstuffs have become expensive and even to obtain them 
is very difﬁ cult.
 Desa Bangunarjo menjadi terkenal di seluruh kabupaten 
sampai pedagang kota pun datang ke sana.
 The village of Bangunarjo has become well-known through-
out the kabupaten, to the extent that even city traders come 
there.
Like pun, juga and pula ‘also’ can be used to indicate emphasis 
(see, for example, discussion in 4.91) and addition (see 2.219), 
2.221
2.222
2.223

238 Phrases
and thus sometimes accompany pun to make a stronger state-
ment:
 Indonesia adalah tanah yang subur. Tetapi bukan tanahnya 
saja; penduduknya pun demikian pula.
 Indonesia is a fertile land. But it is not just the land; the 
people also are the same.
 Mereka ingin menyadarkan masyarakat bahwa mereka 
pun manusia juga.
 They wish to make society aware that they too are human 
beings.
Sometimes pun acts to link two clauses which have the same 
subject, being placed after the subject of the second clause. In 
earlier literary Malay this device was very common in construc-
tions referring to a sequence of actions; in modern Indonesian 
it is much rarer:
 Setelah Taifah mendengar kata perempuan itu, Taifah pun 
segera kembali ke rumahnya.
 After Taifah heard what the woman said he returned to his 
house.
 Maka sekali waktu baginda pergi berburu ke dalam hutan, 
maka baginda pun bertemu dengan seekor kijang …
 Once His Majesty went hunting in the forest. He came across 
a deer …6
Two clauses can be linked by pun even if they have differ-
ent subjects. Pun follows the subject of the second clause and 
emphasises it. The action of the second clause always follows the 
action of the ﬁ rst clause; pun can thus often be translated ‘then’ 
in such constructions:
 Teriakan Sukijan cepat didengar dan para tetangga pun 
mulai berdatangan.
 Sukijan’s cries were quickly heard and the neighbours then 
began arriving.
 Berdasarkan surat kecil ini, polisi pun mulus melacak 
alamat mereka.
 On the basis of this brief letter the police were then easily 
able to trace their address.
2.224

Adjuncts 239
 Merasa gundah dan tak tahu apa yang harus dia lakukan, 
Presiden pun bertanya …
 Feeling depressed and not knowing what he should do, the 
President then asked …
In literary Malay, the subject is often marked by pun while the 
predicate is indicated by -lah in the main clause. However, this is 
not common usage in modern Indonesian. Examples are given 
in section 3.52.
Conjunctions such as meskipun and walaupun ‘although, even 
if’ (see 4.76) or biarpun ‘even if’ have pun attached to them and 
have a meaning which is clearly related to this particle.
Indeﬁ nite pronouns often include pun. These may be formed 
with interrogative pronouns; for example, siapa pun, apa pun, 
berapa pun.
Siapa pun yang ada diajak ke rumahnya.
Whoever was there was invited to her house.
Ia selalu akan dicurigai, ke mana pun perginya.
She’ll always be suspected wherever she goes.
Bagaimana pun juga, kita akan menyelamatkannya
No matter how, we’ll save him.
Negative indeﬁ nite pronouns include tidak seorang pun ‘no one’ 
(see 2.91) and sedikit pun tidak ‘not even a little’ (see 2.140).

3 CLAUSES
A clause is a construction which contains a predicate and, with 
some minor exceptions, a subject. A clause is either indepen-
dent or dependent. An independent clause is one which can 
occur alone as a sentence (see 4.63). A dependent clause cannot 
occur alone but is always part of a larger structure. It may be 
embedded in a clause or in a smaller component such as a noun 
phrase. Dependent clauses may also be combined with other 
clauses to form sentences; these are called subordinate clauses. 
All clause types are described in this chapter except subordinate 
clauses, which are discussed in Chapter 4.
A distinction can be made between basic and derived clauses. 
A basic clause is an independent clause which is described 
without reference to any other clause type. Derived clauses can 
best be described with reference to basic clauses; they can be 
either independent or dependent. Under this deﬁ nition passive 
clauses are derived. However, they are discussed together with 
active clauses, beginning in section 3.26. Other derived clauses 
are described in sections 3.86–145.
BASIC CLAUSES
Basic clauses have two types of constituents: nuclear con -
stituents and adjuncts. Nuclear constituents are obligatory to 
3.1
3.2

Basic clauses 241
the clause, the clause being incomplete without them. For most 
clause types, the nuclear constituents are subject and predicate. 
Subjects are discussed in section 3.3 and predicates in section 3.4. 
Other nuclear components of clauses are discussed elsewhere. For 
transitive verbal clauses, object and, in some, secondary object are 
nuclear. Further, complements are nuclear in a variety of clause 
types. Adjuncts are rarely essential to a construction. They give 
additional information on such matters as manner, time, place 
and so on; their absence does not affect the basic meaning of the 
clause. Adjuncts are described in sections 2.165–226.
The normal word order of clause constituents is mentioned 
in section 3.41 and changes from that order are discussed in 
following sections. One of the functions of changing word order 
is to focus attention on a particular clause element. A number 
of particles also serve this function (see 3.50ff).
Subject
The subject of a clause is in general terms the thing which is 
being discussed, the ‘theme’ of the utterance. It is frequently 
something which has been mentioned previously, about which 
something new (the predicate) is said. As such it is usually 
deﬁ nite (although this is not always the case—see 3.39).
The subject of a clause is usually a noun phrase or a pronoun 
phrase, as in the ﬁ rst two examples below. A number of other 
constructions can also be subject, including a simple nominal 
clause (see 3.143) and a bahwa clause (see 3.108), as in the third 
and fourth examples:
Anak-anak itu bermain di pantai.
The children were playing on that beach.
Mereka menyelengarakan penelitian di Aceh.
They undertook research in Aceh.
Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
Finding work in the city isn’t very easy.
Bahwa dia suka pada Siti bukan rahasia lagi.
That he likes Siti isn’t a secret any more.
A number of other constructions can function as subject of a 
clause; examples are given in the sections dealing with those 
constructions.
3.3

242 Clauses
Some clauses have no subject; these are discussed in section 
3.15.
Predicate types
The structure of predicate phrases is described in sections 
2.132–61. The predicate is the hub of the clause and it deter-
mines much of the rest of the clause structure. Clause types are 
identiﬁ ed by the element functioning as the predicate centre. 
Clauses are either verbal, having a verb as their predicate centre, 
or non-verbal, having one of a number of non-verbal elements 
as their predicate centre. The major types of non-verbal clause 
are discussed in sections 3.5–15. Copulas, which occur in non-
verbal clauses, are discussed in section 3.14. Verbal clauses are 
discussed in sections 3.16–40.
Noun clauses
Noun clauses have a noun phrase as their predicate centre. A 
noun phrase predicate tells us what the subject is: either identi-
fying it, as with keputusan saya ‘my decision’ below, or explain-
ing what sort of thing it is, as with guru ‘a teacher’.
Ini keputusan saya. This is my decision.
Dia guru. She is a teacher.
Noun clauses are negated by bukan (see 2.134):
Dia bukan guru. She isn’t a teacher.
Most subtypes of noun can occur in the predicate, including 
demonstrative pronouns (see 2.65) and personal pronouns (see 
2.66). Also included are simple nominal clauses (see 3.143), 
bahwa clauses (see 3.108) and untuk clauses (see 3.113). That 
these function as nouns can be seen from the fact that the 
re lationship between subject and predicate is equative, not 
one of actor and action. Further, the negative is bukan and the 
subject and predicate are frequently separated by copula adalah 
or ialah (see 3.14), which cannot occur in verbal clauses:
Pekerjaannya tiap hari ialah memasak di dapur.
Her work every day is to cook in the kitchen.
Kesukaannya bukan membaca novel.
His pastime is not reading novels.

3.6

Basic clauses 243
Hakikatnya ialah bahwa saya benar.
The truth is that I am correct.
Maksudnya adalah untuk mendidik rakyat Australia.
His purpose is to educate the Australian people.
In a few cases, the predicate core appears to be a noun but 
is in fact a verb or an adjective and is therefore negated with 
tidak rather than bukan. Thus sekolah ‘school’ in the following 
example is acting as a verb, being equivalent to bersekolah ‘go 
to school’. Likewise, kuliah ‘lecture’ can mean ‘attend a lecture’ 
and sukses ‘success’ can mean ‘successful’.
Anak saya (tidak) sekolah di Rawamangun.
My children (do not) go to school in Rawamangun.
 Jika yang tidak kuliah saja bisa sukses, apalagi anak 
kuliahan.
 If those who have not studied at university can be successful, 
then university students can be even more so.
Quantity clauses
In quantity clauses the predicate states the number or measure-
ment of the subject.
The predicate can be a cardinal number (see 2.107):
Anaknya lima.
He has ﬁ ve children. (literally: ‘His children are ﬁ ve.’)
Kucing saya dua.
I have two cats.
Other numbers can occur in the predicate, including some 
indeﬁ nite numbers (see 2.113) and indeﬁ nite multiples with 
ber- (see 1.161):
Uangnya banyak/sedikit.
 He has a lot of/little money. (literally: ‘His money is a lot/a 
little.’)
Ternak Pak Harun ini beratus-ratus.
 Mr Harun has hundreds of animals. (literally: ‘Mr Harun’s 
livestock are hundreds.’)
The predicate can be a number followed by a classiﬁ er or partitive, 
or it can be a partitive of the type mentioned in section 1.162:
3.7
3.8

244 Clauses
Anggota panitia itu sepuluh orang.
 That committee has ten members. (literally: ‘The members 
of that committee are ten + classiﬁ er.’)
 Jumlah wesel yang dikirim sembilan ribu tujuh ratus 
lembar.
 The number of money orders sent was nine thousand seven 
hundred.
Kue di meja lima potong.
 There are ﬁ ve slices of cake on the table. (literally: ‘The cake 
on the table is ﬁ ve pieces.’)
tanahnya berhektar-hektar.
He has (many) hectares of land.
A measurement noun phrase (see 2.30) can occur as predicate 
of a quantity clause. The subject of such a clause can be a nomi-
nalised adjective of measure (see 3.140):
Beratnya tujuh puluh kilo.
His weight is seventy kilos.
Tinggi saya seratus tujuh puluh delapan (sentimeter).
 My height is one hundred and seventy-eight 
(centimetres).
Panjang sisinya lima belas meter.
The length of its sides is 15 metres.
Quantity clauses are negated with tidak unless a contrast is 
stated or implied, in which case bukan is used (see 2.137):
Anaknya tidak banyak.
They don’t have many children.
Penggemarnya bukan satu dua orang melainkan ribuan.
Her fans are not only one or two but thousands.
Adjective clauses
Adjective phrases (see 2.99) can occur in the predicate centre:
Risikonya akan berat sekali.
The risk will be very great.
Minuman itu harus dingin.
The drinks must be cold.
3.9

Basic clauses 245
If an adjective clause is negated, tidak usually occurs immedi-
ately before the adjective phrase:
Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
Looking for work in the city isn’t very easy.
Sometimes tidak can occur directly before the adjective. This is 
discussed in section 2.104.
An adjective clause can contain an experiencer phrase (see 2.105) 
and have a simple nominal clause (see 3.143) as its subject. If 
the simple nominal clause immediately follows the experiencer 
phrase, the noun may at ﬁ rst glance appear to be the subject of 
the nominal clause:
Sulit bagi kita mencari pekerjaan di kota.
It is difﬁ cult for us getting work in the city.
However, the experiencer phrase bagi kita ‘for us’ is a single unit 
and can be omitted; also, the simple nominal clause can either 
precede the predicate or be preceded by untuk. These variations 
show that kita ‘we’ is not acting as subject of the simple nominal 
clause. Examples of these constructions are given in section 
3.115.
Adjective clauses containing an experiencer phrase and having as 
subject a simple nominal clause or an untuk clause correspond 
semantically to adjective clauses containing a verbal clause as 
complement (as discussed in section 3.85). The following two 
examples both have sukar ‘hard, difﬁ cult’ as predicate centre. 
The ﬁ rst construction has bagi kami ‘for us’ as an experiencer 
phrase within the predicate and (untuk) menerima kenyataan 
ini ‘to accept this fact’ as subject; the second has kenyataan ini 
‘this fact’ as subject and (untuk) kami terima ‘for us to accept’ 
as complement. The latter construction is more likely to be 
limited to formal written Indonesian.
Sukar bagi kami untuk menerima kenyataan ini.
It is difﬁ cult for us to accept this fact./
Accepting this fact is difﬁ cult for us.
Kenyataan ini sukar (untuk) kami terima.
This fact is difﬁ cult for us to accept.
3.10
3.11

246 Clauses
Prepositional clauses
Some of the prepositional phrases which can occur as clause 
adjuncts (see 2.165ff) can also occur as predicate centres. The 
following examples illustrate a variety of clauses with preposi-
tional phrases in their predicates:
Kalung ini untuk ibu.
This necklace is for mother.
Tidak semua perusahaan seperti ini.
Not all companies are like this.
Dia dengan pacarnya sekarang.
He’s with his girlfriend now.
Mereka di Jakarta sekarang.
They are in Jakarta now.
Some prepositional clauses can be negated by either bukan or 
tidak (see 2.136):
Kehidupan mereka tidak tanpa harapan.
Their lives aren’t without hope.
Penyakitnya bukan karena itu.
His illness is not because of that.
The preposition sama dengan ‘equals, the same as’ occurs in prep-
ositional clauses indicating arithmetic operations (see 2.111):
Enam tambah dua sama dengan delapan.
Six plus two equals eight.
Sepuluh kurang lima sama dengan lima.
Ten minus ﬁ ve equals ﬁ ve.
The copulas adalah and ialah
The copulas, which correspond to what are sometimes called 
linking verbs in grammars of other languages, are adalah and 
ialah. They occur optionally between the subject and predicate 
in non-verbal clauses. The two forms are interchangeable except 
that ialah only occurs after third person subjects.
Copulas occur most commonly in noun clauses and 
some Indonesians regard them as unacceptable in any other 
clause types. However, they are readily used by other speakers 
in some other non-verbal clauses, especially in adjective 
clauses.
3.12
3.13
3.14

Basic clauses 247
Copulas mark the division between subject and predicate. 
They are not obligatory and are least likely to occur in short 
constructions such as Ayah guru ‘Father is a teacher’.
They are most common in noun clauses where either the 
subject or predicate is long, in which case they break up a string 
of nouns and add a smoothness to the construction:
Ayah Tomo adalah pegawai Bank Indonesia.
Tomo’s father is an employee of the Bank of Indonesia.
Kain kebaya ialah pakaian wanita Jawa.
The kain kebaya is the clothing of Javanese women.
Copulas are also frequently used if the predicate is a nominalised 
verb, bahwa clause or untuk clause (see 3.6 for examples).
The following examples illustrate copulas in adjective and 
prepositional clauses:
Setiap calon pembeli adalah penting.
Each prospective purchaser is important.
Satu-satunya air yang ada adalah dari telaga.
The only water there is is from the lake.
The copulas adalah and ialah are not verbs; they precede the 
entire predicate, including a negative. The combination of a 
copula and negative is, however, rare:
 Bahasa Indonesia adalah bukan bahasa yang penampil 
subyek.
Indonesian is not a subject-prominent language.
Pernyataan ketua koperasi itu adalah tidak benar.
 The statement by the chairman of the cooperative is not 
correct.
Several other words are sometimes referred to as copulas 
because they serve to link two noun phrases. However, these 
words, including merupakan ‘be, constitute’ and menjadi ‘be, 
become’, are full verbs and can be negated.
Subjectless clauses
Some clauses describe states or events for which there is no 
subject. They correspond to English constructions which have 
‘impersonal it’ as subject (which is sometimes called a ‘dummy 
3.15

248 Clauses
subject’ because it does not actually refer to or identify anything; 
it simply occurs because the clause structure of English, unlike 
Indonesian, demands the presence of a subject).
Such clauses frequently refer to natural states:
Hujan sekarang.
It’s raining now.
Dingin sekali.
It’s very cold.
Sepi di sini.
It’s quiet here.
Some people use words such as hari ‘day’ or hawa ‘weather’ as a 
subject in some of these constructions:
Hari hujan.
It’s raining.
Hawa panas.
The weather’s hot.
Subjectless clauses can also refer to time:
Sudah jam tujuh.
It’s already seven o’clock.
Verbal clauses
Verbal clauses have a verb as their predicate centre. Verbal 
clauses display greater variety and complexity than non-verbal 
constructions; special consideration is required for transitivity 
(see 3.18–25), voice (see 3.26–40) and word order (see 3.41–9). 
The verb ada has some unique characteristics and is discussed 
separately in sections 3.54–60.
Further, a consideration of grammatical roles and semantic 
roles is important for an understanding of verbal clauses. This 
topic is mentioned in section 3.17.
Participant roles
Components of the clause such as subject and object refer to 
grammatical relationships. However, the semantic relationship 
between these elements and the predicate can vary. For instance, 
in the clause Ali memukul John ‘Ali hits John’, the subject Ali 
refers to the participant who carries out the action, the actor. 
3.16
3.17

Basic clauses 249
In the clause Ali dipukul John ‘Ali is hit by John’, the subject 
Ali identiﬁ es the participant to which something is done, the 
patient.
The major participants, or semantic roles, are:
 Actor: The one who carries out the action. The actor is 
expressed by the subject in an active clause, such as Ali in Ali 
menolong saya ‘Ali helps me’. It occurs as agent in a passive 
clause, which is optionally marked by oleh ‘by’ (see 3.27): 
Saya ditolong (oleh) Ali ‘I am helped by Ali’.
 Patient: The patient, also called the goal, is the participant 
which is moved or affected by the action. It occurs as object 
in most active clauses, such as Ali in Mereka menolong Ali 
‘They help Ali’. It occurs as subject in the passive of such 
constructions: Ali ditolong oleh mereka ‘Ali is helped by 
them’. With ditransitive verbs the patient can occur as the 
secondary object (see 3.20). Thus, the patient uang ‘money’ 
occurs as secondary object in Saya memberi dia uang 
‘I give him money’.
 Recipient: This is the person at whom the action is directed. 
It can follow prepositions kepada and pada ‘to’. With some 
verbs, especially some -i verbs (see 1.212), it can occur as 
object, such as dia ‘he’ in Saya mengirimi dia uang ‘I sent 
him money’. In passives of such constructions it occurs as 
subject: Dia dikirimi uang ‘He is sent money’.
 Location: This is the place where the action occurs or the 
place from which or to which the action is directed. It is 
normally marked by a prepositional phrase. However, it can 
be the object with some -i verbs and some simple transitive 
verbs, such as kebun ‘garden’ in Mereka menanami kebun 
‘They plant the garden’. In passives of such constructions it 
occurs as subject: Kebun ditanami ‘The garden is planted’.
 Beneﬁ ciary: This is the person for whose beneﬁ t an action is 
performed. It is usually marked by preposition untuk ‘for’. 
With benefactive -kan verbs (see 1.206) it occurs as object, 

250 Clauses
such as Ali in Saya membelikan Ali buku ‘I buy Ali a book’. 
In passives of such constructions it occurs as subject: Ali 
dibelikan buku ‘Ali is bought a book’.
 Instrument: This is the thing with which the action is 
performed. It is usually marked by preposition dengan ‘with’, 
such as tali ‘rope’ in Dia mengikat anjing dengan tali ‘He 
tied up the dog with a rope’. This participant can sometimes 
occur as object; that is, with ‘instrumental’ -kan (see 1.205). 
However, it is probably best to recognise a reinterpretation of 
the role of the participant in this case. That is, in the construc-
tion Dia mengikatkan tali ke pohon ‘He tied the rope to a 
tree’, tali is best considered as having the role of patient.
Transitive and intransitive
An intransitive clause has two nuclear components: a subject, 
which indicates the actor, and a predicate, which contains an 
intransitive verb (see 1.166ff):
Mereka bekerja.
They are working.
Siti menangis.
Siti is crying.
Intransitive clauses frequently contain one or more adjuncts 
(see 2.165); the following includes adjuncts of time, manner 
and location:
Setiap hari mereka bekerja keras di pabrik.
Every day they work hard in the factory.
In addition to the actor, some actions or events directly involve 
another person or thing which is affected by the action and 
which is expressed by a noun phrase following the verb, called 
the object. Clauses which have an object are called transitive 
clauses and verbs which occur in these clauses are called transi-
tive verbs (see 1.186ff):
Saya membantu ibu.
I am helping mother.
Ali menjual mobilnya.
Ali sold his car.
3.18
3.19

Basic clauses 251
A transitive clause minimally consists of a subject, a predi-
cate and an object, as in the above examples. In addition, a 
number of adjuncts can occur. In the following construction 
an adjunct of time and a recipient occur:
Tahun lalu Ali menjual mobilnya kepada Hasan.
Last year Ali sold his car to Hasan.
Ditransitive clauses
The object may express one of a number of participants. In 
the examples in section 3.19 it expresses a patient. It may also 
express a beneﬁ ciary (see 1.206) or a recipient (see 1.212). In 
such clauses another noun phrase, the secondary object, must 
occur to express the patient:
Mereka mengirimi kami surat.
They sent us a letter.
Ibu membuatkan Siti rok.
Mother made Siti a skirt.
In the above examples the ﬁ nal noun, surat ‘letter’ in the ﬁ rst 
sentence and rok ‘skirt’ in the second, is the secondary object. 
Clauses which require two objects are usually called ditransitive 
clauses. In grammars of English, and in some grammars of Indo-
nesian, the person who receives (such as kami in the ﬁ rst example 
above) or beneﬁ ts (such as Siti in the second example above) is 
usually called the indirect object, while the patient (surat and 
rok) is called the direct object. However, in this description the 
noun immediately following the verb is called the primary object 
and the other noun is called the secondary object. As explained 
in sections 1.206 and 1.229, the clause can be arranged so that the 
patient appears as primary object; in this case, the recipient or 
beneﬁ ciary must be expressed by a prepositional phrase and there 
is no secondary object (see also the examples in 3.17).
Pseudo-intransitive verbs
While most transitive verbs require the object to be expressed, there 
are some whose object need not be expressed. The object of such 
verbs can be omitted when it is obvious or unimportant, as in:
Wendy sedang membaca.
Wendy is reading.
3.20
3.21

252 Clauses
The action expressed by membaca ‘read’ involves an object. 
However, interest is often on the fact that the action is being 
performed rather than on what it is being done to; in such cases 
the object is not expressed, as in the above example. Such verbs are 
sometimes called intransitive. However, a real intransitive verb refers 
to an action which does not carry over to another person or thing 
and involves only the actor, such as tidur ‘sleep’ and berdiri ‘stand’. 
Verbs like membaca ‘read’ describe actions which conceptually 
have a patient, even if it is not expressed as an explicit object. They 
are therefore transitive and have a passive form. Some grammars 
call them pseudo-intransitive verbs. A large number of transitive 
verbs can occur without an object being expressed, including:
makan eat 
menulis write
minum drink 
melukis paint
menyapu sweep 
menggambar draw
memasak cook 
menyeterika iron
mencangkul hoe 
menggergaji saw
All verbs acting in this way are simple transitive verbs (see 1.187). 
Verbs with afﬁ xes per-, -kan or -i cannot omit the object (with 
the exception of the emotion verbs discussed in section 1.194). 
Where sufﬁ x -kan and -i are optional (see 1.210 and 1.224), only 
the variant without the sufﬁ x can occur without an object:
Anak-anak sedang menyanyikan lagu.
The children are singing a song.
Anak-anak sedang menyanyi (lagu).
The children are singing (a song).
Kami bisa menyeberangi sungai di sini.
We can cross the river here.
Kami bisa menyeberang (sungai) di sini.
We can cross (the river) here.
In English the list of pseudo-intransitive verbs is longer than 
in Indonesian; an English pseudo-intransitive verb sometimes 
corresponds to different transitive and intransitive verbs in 
Indonesian. Thus pseudo-intransitive ‘enter’ corresponds to 
either transitive memasuki or intransitive masuk:
Dia memasuki kamar.
He entered the room.
Dia masuk.
He entered.

Basic clauses 253
Formal distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs
In standard Indonesian a clear distinction is made between 
intransitive and transitive verbs. By its form a verb almost 
always identiﬁ es itself as transitive or intransitive. (Intransi-
tive verbs with preﬁ x meN-, such as menangis ‘cry’, and a very 
few intransitive verbs which have a sufﬁ x [see 3.25] would be 
exceptions to this generalisation.) While in English many verbs 
function both transitively and intransitively, in Indonesian this 
is almost never the case. There is almost always some difference 
in form between an intransitive and transitive verb having the 
same base. Each (a) construction below is an intransitive clause; 
each (b) construction is the transitive counterpart. The verbs 
always differ, while in English they do not:
a.  Anaknya mandi.
 
His child is bathing.
b.  Dia memandikan anaknya.
 
He is bathing his child.
a.  Bis berhenti di depan gedung sekolah.
 
The bus stopped in front of the school.
b.  Sopir menghentikan bis di depan gedung sekolah.
 
The driver stopped the bus in front of the school.
In the above examples the transitive verbs have causative sufﬁ x 
-kan. Other examples are given in section 1.198. In some cases 
transitive and intransitive verbs differ only in their preﬁ x, the 
intransitive verb, sometimes indicating reﬂ exive action, having 
ber- and the transitive verb having meN-, such as berubah 
‘(undergo) change’ and mengubah ‘change (something)’:
Wajah Jakarta sudah berubah.
The face of Jakarta has changed.
 Gedung-gedung pencakar langit sudah mengubah wajah 
Jakarta.
Skyscrapers have changed the face of Jakarta.
Other pairs include:
bercukur shave 
mencukur shave (someone/
something)
bergaruk(-garuk) scratch 
menggaruk scratch 
(something)
3.22

254 Clauses
berputar turn, revolve 
memutar turn, revolve 
(something)
berhias dress up 
menghias decorate, dress 
(something) up
berias put on make-up 
merias dress (someone) up
berbentuk be in the form of membentuk form 
(something)
bergantung hang, be 
menggantung hang 
  suspended  
  (something) up
Transitive and intransitive in Indonesian and English
Some intransitive verbs correspond to transitive verbs in English. 
Corresponding to the object of the English verb is a preposi-
tional phrase, as in the ﬁ rst example below (see also 1.219), or a 
complement, as in the second example. Although resembling an 
object, the complement cannot become the subject in a passive 
construction (see 3.63).
Pak Parno cinta akan istrinya.
Mr Parno loves his wife.
Mereka belajar bahasa Jepang.
They are learning Japanese.
Some Indonesian transitive verbs are translated by English 
verbs which take a following preposition (called phrasal verbs 
in English), such as mencari ‘look for’:
Ali mencari adiknya di pasar.
Ali looked for his sister at the market.
Others, with exemplary objects in parentheses, include:
melamar (pekerjaan) apply for (work)
meminta (uang) ask for (money)
membayar (barang) pay for (goods)
melihat (foto) look at (photo)
memikirkan (hal itu) think about (that matter)
meminang (gadis) propose to (a girl)
Intransitive verbs with a sufﬁ x
A few verbs with a sufﬁ x are not transitive; they do not have 
a passive form and the following noun is therefore a comple-
3.23
3.24
3.25

Basic clauses 255
ment, not an object. These include merupakan ‘constitute, be’ 
and menyerupai ‘resemble’:
 Pulau Bali merupakan tujuan yang paling populer untuk 
turis asing.
Bali is the most popular destination for foreign tourists.
Dia menyerupai ayahnya.
He resembles his father.
The verb memadai ‘satisfy; be sufﬁ cient’ can occur with or 
with out a complement:
Gaji mereka tidak memadai.
Their salary is not sufﬁ cient.
Gaji itu tidak memadai kebutuhan mereka.
The salary does not fulﬁ l their needs.
Voice: active and passive
The person or thing we want to talk about is usually expressed 
as the subject of the clause. If we want to talk about the actor, 
we make it the subject of the verb and use an active verb. Active 
transitive verbs have preﬁ x meN-. The construction is called an 
active clause or said to be in active voice.
The other participant in the action is expressed by the object 
in an active clause. If we want to focus attention on this other 
participant, we make it the subject of the passive form of the 
verb. The construction is called a passive clause or is said to be 
in passive voice. The actor is expressed by an agent phrase which 
follows the passive verb. A passive verb either has preﬁ x di- 
(see 3.27) or has no preﬁ x (see 3.28). The ﬁ rst example below 
is an active construction in which the subject is the actor; the 
second is a passive construction in which the subject is the 
patient:
Mereka sudah menjemput Tomo.
They have met Tomo.
Tomo sudah dijemput oleh mereka.
Tomo has been met by them.
Some grammars of Indonesian do not use the terms active and 
passive, instead using such terms as subject and object construc-
tion or subjective and objective focus. This is because there are 
3.26

256 Clauses
differences between the constructions in Indonesian and the 
active and passive in European languages such as English, in both 
structure and function. Nevertheless, there are also important 
similarities, and the relationship between the two constructions 
is often similar to the relationship between active and passive in 
English, allowing the same terms to be used to describe them. 
The structure of a passive clause can be described with reference 
to the corresponding active.
The passive construction is more frequent in Indonesian than 
in English. Where a passive translation would sound unnatu-
ral, translation by an active construction is usually given in the 
following sections.
The Indonesian passive has two different forms, called here 
‘passive type one’ and ‘passive type two’.1 The choice of passive 
type is determined by the actor.
Passive type one
In this type of passive the actor is third person, that is pronoun 
dia or mereka, or a noun (but see 3.29 regarding ﬁ rst and 
second person agents with type one passives). Passive type one 
is also used if no actor is expressed. The structure of an active 
clause and its corresponding passive type one are set out as 
follows:
Active voice:
Subject (actor) + meN-verb + object (patient)
Passive voice:
Subject (patient) + di-verb + (oleh) + agent (actor)
These structures are illustrated by the following active clause 
and corresponding passive form:
Dia menjemput saya.
He met me.
Saya dijemput oleh dia.
I was met by him.
In the above example the actor is dia ‘he’. The following illus-
trate passives with the other possible actors, mereka, a noun or 
no actor expressed:
3.27

Basic clauses 257
Dia sudah diberi uang itu oleh mereka.
She has already been given the money by them.
Surat ini ditulis oleh sekretaris.
This letter was written by the secretary.
Barang ini akan dikirim ke Jepang.
These goods will be sent to Japan.
A third person singular agent can be expressed by either dia or 
-nya. They are optionally preceded by oleh ‘by’:
Saya dijemputnya/olehnya.
Saya dijemput dia/oleh dia.
I was met by him.
Oleh is optional when the agent immediately follows the verb. If 
the agent does not immediately follow the verb, oleh is obliga-
tory. This occurs when another clause element comes between 
the verb and agent or when the agent is placed before the verb 
to receive highlighting (see 3.47).
In passive type one the components of the predicate (see 
2.132ff) apart from the verb remain unchanged:
Mereka sudah dijemputnya.
They have already been met by him.
Mereka tidak harus dijemputnya.
They do not have to be met by him.
While makan ‘eat’, minum ‘drink’ and a few other transitive 
verbs usually occur without preﬁ x meN- in active voice (see 
1.186), they take di- in the passive: dimakan ‘eaten’, diminum 
‘drunk’. The verb mengerti ‘understand’ retains its preﬁ x meN- 
in the passive (see 1.186): dimengerti ‘understood’.
Passive type two
In passive type two the agent is a pronoun or pronoun substi-
tute (see 2.67). The agent phrase comes before the verb, which 
does not have a preﬁ x. The structure of passive type two is 
thus:
Subject (patient) + agent (actor) + verb
3.28

258 Clauses
The following example shows the relationship between an active 
clause and a passive type two clause:
Kami menjemput dia.
We met him.
Dia kami jemput.
He was met by us.
No other component of the clause can come between the 
agent and the verb in passive type two, especially in writing. 
In par ticular, components of the predicate phrase (see 2.132ff), 
such as negative and temporal marker, come before the agent in 
passive type two:
Buku ini tidak akan kami baca.
This book will not be read by us.
If the agent is aku ‘I’ or kamu ‘you’ the bound forms, ku- and 
kau- respectively (see 2.71), usually occur:
Buku ini sudah kubaca.
I’ve read this book.
Buku ini harus kaubaca.
You must read this book.
Choosing passive type
When producing a passive clause, two things must be consid-
ered in deciding if passive type one or two is to be used: Is the 
actor ﬁ rst, second or third person? and: Is the actor a pronoun 
(including a pronoun substitute) or is it a noun?
Nouns and pronouns can be distinguished as follows:
ﬁ rst
person
second 
person
third 
person
singular
saya
kamu etc.
dia
A
plural
kami, kita
B
mereka
nouns
Passive type one is used where the actor is in box A and passive 
type two is used where the actor is in box B.
3.29

Basic clauses 259
Note that sentences with … oleh saya and so on (passive 
type one with ﬁ rst or second person agent) are being used more 
frequently, even among educated speakers, especially if the 
agent is added as an afterthought. However, this construction is 
still regarded as ungrammatical and should be avoided in more 
formal contexts.
Either passive type one or passive type two can be used if 
the actor is dia or mereka; they occur in both boxes in the 
diagram in section 3.29. This is because they are third person, 
allowing passive type one, and also pronouns, allowing passive 
type two:
Buku sejarah ini belum dibacanya.
Buku sejarah ini belum dia baca.
He hasn’t read this history book yet.
Buku-buku ini sudah dibaca oleh mereka.
Buku-buku ini sudah mereka baca.
They have read these books.
As mentioned in section 2.67, kinship terms such as bapak 
‘father’, ibu ‘mother’ and personal names can occur as pronoun 
substitutes. They can refer to the addressee, meaning ‘you’, or to 
the speaker, meaning ‘I’. When they occur as agent, passive type 
two is used:
Buku itu sudah Tini kembalikan.
I (Tini) have returned the book.
Surat ini harus bapak tandatangani.
You must sign this letter.
If a third person is being spoken about, Tini and bapak would 
be third person nouns and passive type one would be used:
Buku itu sudah dikembalikan oleh Tini.
The book has been returned by Tini.
Surat ini harus ditandatangani bapak.
This letter has to be signed by father.
With ter- verbs (see 1.265ff) and ke-…-an verbs (see 1.276ff) 
which allow an agent only passive type one occurs, even if 
the agent is ﬁ rst or second person. If the agent is a pronoun,

260 Clauses
including a third person pronoun, oleh is obligatory. Examples 
are given in sections 1.269, 1.272 and 1.283. One exception is 
with teringat ‘remember’ (see 1.271).
Further correspondences between active and passive
Typically, only subject, verb and object are affected in active and 
passive constructions, as described in sections 3.26–31. Compo-
nents of the clause other than subject, verb and object are not 
affected.
If there are two objects (see 3.20) in an active clause, it is only 
the primary object—the one immediately following the verb—
which corresponds to the subject of the passive. The following 
examples illustrate active clauses with benefactive -kan and 
locative -i and their passive equivalents:
Dia membelikan adiknya buku.
He bought his brother a book.
Adiknya dibelikannya buku.
His brother was bought a book by him.
Kepala kantor menyerahi kami tugas itu.
The ofﬁ ce head handed us that task.
Kami diserahi kepala kantor tugas itu.
We were handed that task by the ofﬁ ce head.
In the above examples the primary object is the recipient, which 
corresponds to the subject of the passive. If the primary object 
is the patient then the patient is the subject of the correspond-
ing passive, as in the following:
Dia membeli buku itu untuk adiknya.
He bought that book for his brother.
Buku itu dibelinya untuk adiknya.
That book was bought by him for his brother.
Kepala kantor menyerahkan tugas itu kepada kami.
The ofﬁ ce head handed that task to us.
Tugas itu deserahkan oleh kepala kantor kepada kami.
That task was handed by the ofﬁ ce head to us.
In general the sufﬁ xes -i and -kan remain the same in corre-
sponding active and passive sentences. However, there are some 
3.33
3.34
3.35

Basic clauses 261
cases in which their presence or absence differs between active 
and passive.
With some verbs -kan is optional in active voice but obliga-
tory in passive voice, including verbs with bases ajar ‘teach’, 
kirim ‘send’, beri ‘give’, nyanyi ‘sing’:
Dia mengajar(kan) bahasa Indonesia.
He teaches Indonesian.
Bahasa Indonesia diajarkan di sini.
Indonesian is taught here.
Dia sudah memberi(kan) uang itu kepada adiknya.
He has given the money to his brother.
Uang itu sudah diberikan kepada adiknya.
The money has been given to his brother.
Mereka menyanyi(kan) lagu Indonesia.
They are singing an Indonesian song.
Lagu apa yang mereka nyanyikan?
What song are they singing?
On the other hand -kan is obligatory with some active verbs, 
such as meninggalkan ‘leave’ and memaksudkan ‘mean’, but 
can be omitted in the passive:
Dia meninggalkan tasnya di kantin.
She left her bag (deliberately) in the canteen.
Tasnya ditinggal(kan) di kantin.
Her bag was left (deliberately) in the canteen.
Dia memaksudkan kalimat ini.
He means this sentence.
Kalimat ini yang dimaksud.
This is the sentence which is meant.
A number of -kan verbs with emotive adjective bases are usually 
causative in active voice but indicate that the actor experiences 
the emotion in the passive. These are discussed in section 
1.197.
Preposition dengan ‘with’ can be omitted in a passive clause if 
the subject marks the recipient. In almost all cases, the verb has 
locative -i and no agent is expressed:
Aku didandani pakaian pengantin.
I was adorned in bridal clothes.
3.36
3.37

262 Clauses
Kamar-kamar di hotel ini dilengkapi sistem pendingin.
Rooms in this hotel are provided with a cooling system.
Tanah itu ditanami pohon jati.
The land was planted with teak trees.
The verb can be a simple transitive verb, but the relationship of 
the subject must nevertheless be that of recipient:
Tangannya diikat tali plastik.
His hands were bound with plastic cord.
If an agent is expressed it must follow the instrument (and be 
marked by oleh), otherwise dengan must occur:
 Kantor Monitor dilempari batu oleh sekelompok 
mahasiswa Islam.
 The Monitor ofﬁ ce was pelted with stones by a group of 
Moslem students.
Ladang itu ditanami Pak Mendur dengan ubi.
The gardens were planted by Mr Mendur with cassava.
Dengan cannot be omitted if the subject marks the patient:
Nasi boleh dimakan dengan tangan.
Rice can be eaten by hand.
Uses of the passive
As in English, passive constructions allow the speaker to avoid 
mentioning the actor. This is sometimes necessary or desired 
because the actor is not known, is obvious or is not impor-
tant, or because the action is something which can be done by 
anyone:
Sepedanya dicuri tadi malam.
His car was stolen last night.
Saya disuruh pergi.
I was ordered to go.
Mayatnya ditemukan dekat rel kereta api.
His body was discovered near the railway line.
Mudah-mudahan segala dosa orang ini akan diampuni.
Hopefully all this person’s sins will be forgiven.
Buku macam ini dapat dipinjam dari perpustakaan pusat.
Books like this can be borrowed from the central library.
3.38

Basic clauses 263
While every active transitive verb has a passive counterpart, it is 
not the case that every active construction has a corresponding 
passive construction that is natural or acceptable. If the patient 
is indeﬁ nite, it usually cannot be the subject of a passive verb. 
Thus most Indonesians would not accept a passive correspond-
ing to the following active clauses:
Dia membaca sebuah buku.
He’s reading a book.
Dia melihat seseorang.
He saw someone.
The choice between active and passive voice is a choice between 
actor and patient as subject. Subject selection is primarily a 
stylistic matter, which means that in a given context one 
choice may be more appropriate than another but in other 
contexts more than one choice might be possible. Thus, the 
choice between active and passive constructions cannot always 
be explained by set rules. Sometimes, as when no actor is 
expressed, a passive construction must be used, even though 
the patient is indeﬁ nite:
 Seorang gadis kecil, berumur empat tahun, ditemukan tadi 
pagi di depan rumah sakit …
 A little girl, aged four, was discovered this morning in front 
of the hospital …2
 Sebuah rencana untuk mengembangkan dan memanfaat-
kan gas alam sedang disiapkan.
A plan to develop and use natural gas is being prepared.
In most language styles passive constructions are far more 
common in Indonesian than in English. Consequently, an Indo-
nesian passive can often only be translated into natural English by 
an active construction, as in several of the examples in previous 
sections, this being one of the reasons why some grammar-
ians have been reluctant to apply the terms ‘active’ and ‘passive’ 
to Indonesian.3 The following passive sentences are natural in 
Indonesian but cannot be translated by English passives:
Anaknya sendiri tidak pernah dicarikannya jodoh.
 She had never looked for a marriage partner for her own 
child.
3.39

264 Clauses
 Surat kabar ini sudah licin tandas saya baca sampai 
iklan-iklannya.
 I’ve completely read this newspaper right down to the 
advertisements.
Cuma ini yang saya peroleh hari ini.
This is all I’ve got today.
Frequently in narrative discourse a series of actions carried out 
by the same actor is expressed by a string of passive clauses, 
sometimes following an introductory active clause. In such 
sequences there is a focus of interest on the series of actions 
rather than on the participants in the action. Some of the clauses 
in the following examples include word order changes discussed 
in sections 3.41ff:
 Dia datang membawa susu dua gelas. Segelas diletakkan-
nya di atas meja. Yang lain dibawanya padaku.
 She came carrying two glasses of milk. She put one glass on 
the table. The other she brought to me.
 Dimatikannya lampu-lampu dalam kamar tidur itu, lalu 
dengan meraba-raba didekatinya tempat tidur …
 He turned off the lights in the bedroom then, groping his 
way, he approached the bed …
 Ia menimang-nimang kaki ayamnya, sebentar hendak 
ditaruhnya juga di piringnya, sebentar hendak dibuang-
nya. Akhirnya, setelah diawasinya benar-benar tak ada 
bagian yang boleh dimakan, barulah diletakkannya di 
lantai …4
 He played with his chicken leg, one moment going to put it 
on the plate, the next going to throw it away. Finally, but only 
after carefully observing that there was nothing which could 
be eaten, he placed it on the ﬂ oor …
Reﬂ exive passives
A reﬂ exive phrase (see 2.162) can be the subject of a passive 
clause. In this case diri cannot occur alone; constructions like 
melarikan diri ‘ﬂ ee’ (see 2.163) do not have a passive counter-
part. The subject usually follows the verb:
Diamatinya dirinya di kaca dengan cermat.
She studied herself carefully in the mirror.
3.40

Basic clauses 265
Word order in clauses
The normal or standard order of constituents in a clause is 
subject + predicate. In a transitive verbal clause, the normal 
order is subject + predicate + object. If there are two objects 
(see 3.20), the normal order is subject + verb + primary object 
+ secondary object. In a passive type one clause (see 3.27), the 
normal order is subject + verb + agent. If there is a secondary 
object this freely precedes or follows the agent. In passive type 
two (see 3.28) the order is subject + agent + verb.
While some adjuncts tend to occur in a particular position 
within the clause, such as before the subject or after the predi-
cate, they are much freer to move than nuclear components and 
it is not unusual for them to appear in a variety of pos itions. An 
adjunct which usually occurs in one position does not receive any 
emphasis when in that position. If shifted elsewhere, attention 
is drawn to it. Thus the adverb dengan cepat ‘quickly’ occurs in 
its usual position after the verb in the ﬁ rst clause below, where it 
receives no emphasis. In the second clause it is placed before the 
subject, where it receives emphasis:
Endang lari ke toko dengan cepat.
Endang ran to the shop quickly.
Dengan cepat Endang lari ke toko.
Quickly Endang ran to the shop.
Nuclear clause components usually have a ﬁ xed position in 
relation to other nuclear components. When they are moved 
from this position, attention is focused on them.
Changes from normal word order, or inversion, of nuclear 
clause components is discussed in the following sections. A few 
cases of word order change are also mentioned elsewhere when 
it is necessary in the description of a particular construction.
Placing the predicate before the subject
The predicate can occur before the subject in a non-verbal 
clause, such as in a noun clause or adjective clause. In this case, 
the predicate receives highlighting:
Mahasiswa Unpad dia.
She is an Unpad (University of Padjadjaran) student.
3.41
3.42

266 Clauses
O! Sombong kau, Ki Demang.
Oh! you are arrogant, Ki Demang.
Cantik sekali gadis itu.
That girl is very pretty.
An intransitive verb can also occur before the subject. When 
shifted to pre-subject position, a verb frequently takes fore-
grounding particle -lah (see 3.51):
Lalu datanglah seorang musyaﬁ r.
Then there came a traveller.
 Di sini hati saya hancur. Menangislah saya dengan sangat 
sedih.
Here my heart broke. I cried very sadly.
The emphasis given to the verb when it is placed before the 
subject is to some extent caught by the translation of the ﬁ rst 
example above: Datanglah seorang musyaﬁ r ‘There came a 
traveller’, although this device is not always possible in English.
A transitive verb, whether active or passive, can also occur before 
the subject. A passive verb frequently precedes its subject to take 
foregrounding, often with -lah (see 3.51). Very frequently in 
such constructions the verb is preceded by an adjunct, which 
gives a kind of balance to the construction, the verb still occur-
ring in the ‘middle’ of the clause. Similar constructions occur in 
English:
Di atas gunung telah didirikan sebuah antene raksasa.
On top of the mountain has been built a giant antenna.
Pada hari itu terciptalah suatu negara Indonesia merdeka.
On that day there was created a free Indonesia.
Such balancing is not, however, obligatory:
Sudah dibuatkan sepatu khusus bagi dia.
Special shoes have been made for him.
Frequently a long subject is placed after the verb. In the follow-
ing example the subject is the noun phrase beginning with alat-
alat and continuing to the end of the sentence:
3.43
3.44
3.45

Basic clauses 267
 Sekarang di toko Tuan Ong tersedia alat-alat yang menarik 
perhatian orang desa yang berkunjung ke kota.
 Now in Mr Ong’s store are available implements which 
attract the attention of villagers visiting the town.
In such cases the verb is not placed before the subject for high-
lighting, but rather the subject is placed last to avoid a stylis-
tically clumsy construction.
When the subject is a dependent clause, such as a bahwa 
clause (see 3.112), an untuk clause (see 3.115), a supaya/agar 
clause (see 3.127) or a nominal clause (see 3.143), or an indirect 
question (see 4.29) it usually follows the predicate. Such subjects 
are frequently long. The placing of such subjects after the predi-
cate occurs also in non-verbal clauses, as in the last example 
below. The occurrence of ‘it’ at the beginning of corresponding 
constructions in English is discussed in section 3.112:
Diputuskan bahwa saya harus dibuang.
It was decided that I must be driven out.
Sulit untuk menurunkan harga.
It is difﬁ cult to lower prices.
 Diserukan agar dilancarkan aksi-aksi protes internasional 
di semua pusat operasi perusahaan itu.
 It was urged that international protest actions be launched 
in all centres of operation of the company.
Mulai tahun 1970 diwajibkan mengenakan tali pengaman.
 Beginning in 1970 the wearing of seat belts became 
compulsory.
Masih diragukan apakah keputusan ini dapat diterima.
It is still doubted whether this decision can be accepted.
Bukan maksud saya menggurui ayah.
It’s not my intention to lecture father.
In general, the longer a subject the more likely it is to follow 
the predicate. Nevertheless, a long subject may retain its usual 
position before the verb. In the following example the subject, 
jemaat Katolik Jawa yang pertama ‘the ﬁ rst Javanese Catholic 
congregation’, occurs before the verb:
3.46

268 Clauses
 Di mata air Sendangsono pada tanggal tiga puluh Desember 
1904 jemaat Katolik Jawa yang pertama dipermandikan.
 In the Sendangsono spring on the thirtieth of December 
1904 the ﬁ rst Javanese Catholic congregation was baptised.
The position of the agent in a passive clause
The agent of a passive normally comes immediately after the 
verb. However, it can be preceded by several clause elements, in 
which case oleh is obligatory.
A secondary object can occur before or after the agent:
Kami diserahi kepala kantor tugas itu.
Kami diserahi tugas itu oleh kepala kantor.
We were handed that task by the ofﬁ ce head.
A number of adjuncts, such as the adjunct of location in the 
following example, can also precede the agent:
Kami dibawa ke bioskop oleh ayah.
We were taken to the movies by father.
If the speaker wants to treat the agent of a passive verb as impor-
tant information, it can go before the verb. Since it is out of its 
standard position, the agent phrase must be preceded by oleh 
(see 3.27). It can precede or follow the subject:
 Oleh seorang bekas penderita kusta Pak Hena disuruh ke 
rumah sakit lepra.
 By a former leprosy sufferer Mr Hena was told to go to the 
leprosy hospital.
Oleh orang tuanya ia diberi pembantu.
By his parents he was given an assistant.
 Musikus itu oleh pengadilan Selandia Baru divonis tujuh 
tahun penjara.
 The musician was sentenced to seven years jail by the New 
Zealand court.
Position of the object
The object of an active verb cannot occur before the verb. 
Occurrence of the patient participant (see 3.17) before the verb 
requires it to be the subject of a passive verb. This rule also 
applies in derived constructions, as discussed in sections 3.85, 
3.91 and 3.99.
3.47
3.48

Basic clauses 269
If the object of a verb is long it is usually placed last in the 
clause, following other clause components such as adjuncts 
and secondary object. In the following example the object, the 
phrase beginning with rekannya ‘his colleague’, follows the 
instrument:
 Pemain tenis itu mengipasi dengan handuk rekannya yang 
kepanasan.
 The tennis player fanned with a towel his colleague, who was 
overcome by the heat.
If the object is a nominalised construction, such as a bahwa 
clause, a clause beginning with untuk or supaya or an indirect 
question beginning with apakah (see 4.30), it is also placed last 
in the clause. In the following examples the object follows a 
locative phrase beginning with kepada ‘to’:
 Pemerintah mengumumkan kepada petani bahwa harga 
beras akan naik.
 The government announced to the farmers that the price of 
rice would rise.
Dia menyarankan kepada Tuti supaya berolah raga.
He advised Tuti to play sport.
 Kita akan menanyakan kepada masyarakat apakah mereka 
akan menerima kita kembali.
We will ask the community if they will accept us back.
Several changes occurring together
Changes in word order to focus attention on a particular 
component of a clause and to avoid a stilted construction may 
occur together. In the following passive construction the agent 
is fronted for highlighting while the subject, being exceptionally 
long, is placed after the verb:
 Selain itu, oleh desa dikembangkan pula usaha di bidang 
industri rumah, seperti pertenunan.
 Apart from that, by the village have been developed also 
endeavours in the area of home industries, such as weaving.
3.49

270 Clauses
Foregrounding particles
Two particles are recognised here as foregrounding particles, -lah 
and -kah. The latter occurs only in questions and is discussed 
in sections 4.23–6. Particle pun is usually grouped with -lah in 
discussions of Indonesian grammar. Here it is grouped with the 
focusing adjuncts (see 2.221ff).
Particle -lah
Although referred to as a particle, -lah is always written attached 
to the preceding word. Particle -lah has been called, among 
other things, a ‘predicative marker’ and a ‘foreground marker’. 
Its most common function is to mark the predicate when the 
predicate is out of its normal position, usually when it is placed 
before the subject. Since the predicate is strongly foregrounded 
or highlighted in this position -lah is associated with that fore-
grounding, as in the following examples (other examples occur 
in section 3.43):
 Kira-kira tahun 1400 masuklah pengaruh Islam di Indonesia.
About the year 1400 the inﬂ uence of Islam entered Indonesia.
 Sesudah mengucapkan kata-kata itu, bangkitlah dia dari 
kursi dan terus pergi tanpa mengucapkan kata-kata pamit.
 After uttering those words he got up from his chair and 
straightaway went, without taking leave.
Tertipulah kamu!
You were tricked!
Makin yakinlah aku akan kebenaran ﬁ rman Tuhan.
 I am increasingly convinced of the truth of God’s 
commandments.
Particle -lah attaches to the ﬁ rst word of the predicate, which 
may be a negative, temporal marker or modal:
 Dapatlah disimpulkan bahwa serangan itu direncanakan 
lama sebelumnya.
 It can be concluded that the attack was planned well in 
advance.
 Tidaklah pantas kalau pemburuan kanguru masih tetap 
diizinkan.
 It is not appropriate if kangaroo hunting is permitted to 
continue.
3.50
3.51

Basic clauses 271
Particle -lah can also attach to negatives to give emphasis (or 
foregrounding), even if the predicate is in its normal position:
 Hubungan antara kedua petinggi itu saat ini tidaklah 
terlalu baik.
 Relations between the two important ﬁ gures at the moment 
are not too good.
 Hutan lindung Kapuk bukanlah hutan lindung pertama 
yang berubah fungsi.
 The Kapuk protected forest is not the ﬁ rst protected forest to 
undergo a change of function.
It sometimes also occurs with other words, such as modify-
ing adverbs, to emphasise them without the predicate being 
fronted:
Hubungan Indonesia dan Amerika sangatlah dekat.
Relations between Indonesia and America are very close.
Particle -lah is never obligatory; it is particularly common in 
certain constructions where the predicate typically precedes 
the subject, such as identifying clauses (see 3.92) and certain 
imperatives (see 4.40), and is discussed separately for such 
constructions.
A predicate marked by -lah does not occur before the subject if 
this is marked for emphasis by pun (see 2.221ff):
 Dan penonton menyambut dengan tepuk tangan yang 
meriah. Kemudian layar pun tutuplah.
 And the audience applauded (our performance) with 
cheerful clapping. Afterwards the curtain closed.
 Anak-anak mulai bubar. Dan yang tinggal di ruang kelas 
enam, tempat kami disunati, hanyalah orang tua-tua. 
Mereka pun pulanglah seorang demi seorang …
 The children dispersed. And only the elders remained in 
classroom six, where we were circumcised. Then they too 
went home one by one …
Besides occurring within the predicate, -lah can be attached to 
a clause adjunct to foreground it. The adjunct always occurs 
ﬁ rst in the clause with -lah attached to its last word. Such 
3.52
3.53

272 Clauses
constructions are usually translated by cleft sentences (see 3.92) 
in English:
 Sejak tahun itulah Indonesia secara resmi menjadi jajahan 
Belanda.
 It was from that year that Indonesia ofﬁ cially became a 
Dutch colony.
 Beginilah terungkapkan cinta dan kesetiaan terhadap para 
leluhur.
 In this way can be expressed love and faithfulness towards 
the ancestors.
Di desalah terdapat masa depan bangsa kita.
It is in the villages that the future of our people is found.
The verb ada
Ada is an intransitive verb which differs signiﬁ cantly from other 
verbs and deserves special comment. It has four basic functions 
corresponding to different word order of the clause in which it 
occurs.
Presentational ada
Ada functions as a ‘presentational’ verb with the meaning ‘there 
is’, ‘there are’. Presentational ada comes before the noun phrase 
denoting the person or thing presented; the latter represents 
information that has not yet been identiﬁ ed in the discourse:
Ada koran.
There is a newpaper.
Ada orang di kantor.
There is someone (/there are people) in the ofﬁ ce.
O ya, masih ada tetangga: mereka juga perlu diundang!
 ‘O yes, and then there are the neighbours: they too should 
be invited!’
Like other verbs, ada can be preceded by negative markers, 
temporal markers and modals:
Di Indonesia tidak ada kanguru.
In Indonesia there are no kangaroos.
Akan ada orang yang berdemonstrasi di luar kantornya.
There will be people demonstrating outside his ofﬁ ce.
3.54
3.55

Basic clauses 273
When banyak ‘much, many’ occurs, presentational ada is 
optional:
Tidak (ada) banyak mobil di jalan hari ini.
There aren’t many cars on the road today.
Presentational ada followed by a phrase beginning with yang 
can best be translated as ‘some (are)’, ‘there are those who/
which …’:
Ada yang besar, ada yang kecil.
Some are big, some are small.
Locational ada
Ada functions as a ‘locational’ verb with the meaning ‘to be 
present’, ‘to be there’ (and not elsewhere). Locational ada follows 
the noun phrase it identiﬁ es as being present; this noun phrase 
refers to a person or thing already identiﬁ ed in the conversation, 
as the following examples demonstrate:
Koran itu ada.
The newspaper is there/available.
Ibu ada? Ada. Di kamar mandi.
Is Mum there? Yes, she is. She’s in the bathroom.
Mengapa tidak membeli mobil baru? Uangnya ada!
Why not buy a new car? The money is there!
Locational ada is optional before the locative preposition di, 
giving a certain emphasis to the person or thing it locates:
Ayah di kantor/Ayah ada di kantor.
Father is in the ofﬁ ce.
Locational ada can be substituted with the verb berada when 
followed by a prepositional phrase:
 Sekarang kita berada (/ada) di sebuah desa di Jawa 
Tengah.
Now we are in a village in Central Java.
Locational ada is different from adalah, which occurs as a 
copula before non-verbal predicates (see 3.14), because ada, 
unlike adalah, is a verb and can be preceded by such predicate 
elements as tidak ‘not’:
3.56

274 Clauses
Ayah tidak (ada) di kantor.
Father is not in the ofﬁ ce.
Sometimes, locational ada can also be translated into English as 
‘exist’, as in the following philosophical statement:
Tuhan ada
God is there./God exists.
Possessive ada
Ada functions as a ‘possessive’ verb with the meaning ‘have’, 
‘possess’. Possessive ada is preceded by a noun phrase indicating 
the possessor and is followed by a complement indicating the 
person/thing had. It is more common in colloquial style:
Abang saya ada tiga anak.
My (older) brother has three kids.
Saya tidak ada uang kecil.
I don’t have any small change.
Another seemingly possessive construction consists of ada 
preceded by the thing possessed and followed by pada + by the 
owner or possessor. This construction can best be translated as 
‘to be in the custody or possession of’, ‘to be with’ [the pre ceding 
noun]. It is not another main function of ada, but rather a 
special application of locational ada:
Buku Ali ada pada saya.
Ali’s book is with me/I’ve got Ali’s book.
Intensifying ada
Ada can occur before a verb as an ‘intensiﬁ er’; intensifying ada 
probably cannot in itself be regarded as a verb, its role being 
similar to that of emphatic ‘do’ in English:
Ia ada menerima surat itu.
He did receive the letter.
Complements
A complement is a clause component which resembles an 
object but which cannot become the subject of a passive clause. 
Complements occur in transitive and intransitive clauses and 
also in adjective clauses. A complement can be an adjective 
3.57
3.58
3.59
3.60
3.61

Basic clauses 275
phrase, a noun phrase or a verbal clause. A complement is 
almost always obligatory to the construction in which it occurs. 
Thus Ibu mulai ‘Mother began’ is incomplete because it does 
not state what mother began doing. The verb mulai requires 
a verbal complement: Ibu mulai berbicara ‘Mother began to 
speak’. Only some ber- verbs, mentioned in section 3.64, have 
optional complements.
For convenience of description, noun and adjective comp-
lements are mentioned in sections 3.62–71, separate from verbal 
complements, which are described in sections 3.72–6. Comp-
lements introduced by untuk are discussed in sections 3.77–9, 
complements introduced by supaya or agar in section 3.80 and 
those introduced by sebagai in sections 3.82–3. Complements 
of adjective clauses are discussed separately in sections 3.83–5.
Noun and adjective complements
Noun and adjective complements can occur with both intran-
sitive and transitive verbs. Occurrence with intransitive verbs 
is described in sections 3.63–70 and with transitive verbs in 
section 3.71. Complement noun phrases include bahwa clauses 
(see 3.66) and indirect questions (see 3.67).
Noun and adjective complements of intransitive verbs
In Indonesian a transitive and an intransitive verb sometimes 
have the same meaning or similar meanings:
Banyak siswa belajar bahasa Perancis.
Banyak siswa mempelajari bahasa Perancis.
Many students study French.
Only the transitive verb has a passive counterpart:
Bahasa Perancis dipelajari banyak siswa.
French is studied by many students.
In the above example, bahasa Perancis ‘French’ is the object of 
the transitive verb mempelajari ‘study’ and can be the subject 
of its passive transformation dipelajari ‘studied’. However, 
belajar is an intransitive verb with no passive counterpart. 
Following belajar the phrase bahasa Perancis is a complement, 
not an object.
3.62
3.63

276 Clauses
Most intransitive verbs with complements correspond to 
English transitive verbs with objects. Thus belajar translates the 
English transitive verbs ‘study’ and ‘learn’.
Among intransitive verbs with noun phrase comp lements are 
numerous ber- verbs. Thus the verb beternak ‘breed animals’ 
can take a noun complement which speciﬁ es which type of 
animal is bred, such as beternak ayam ‘breed chickens’. Section 
1.176 mentions ber- verbs which have a compound base, such 
as bercelana panjang ‘wear long trousers’. The base of such 
a verb is the entire noun phrase, in this case celana panjang 
‘long trousers’, and thus such a construction is not a verb with a 
complement. On the other hand, ternak ayam is not a possible 
phrase and cannot be regarded as a compound base; ayam must 
be treated as a complement to the verb beternak.
Many of the verbs in this group take an optional comp-
lement, especially those with noun bases. Thus beternak can 
occur without a noun complement: Ayah saya beternak ‘My 
father breeds animals’. Others, especially those with verb bases, 
must take a complement, such as bertukar (pikiran) ‘exchange 
(ideas)’. Other examples, with illustrative complements in 
parentheses, are:
berbicara (bahasa Jepang) speak (Japanese)
bermain (olah raga) play (sport)
berpakaian (piyama) wear (pyjamas)
bernyanyi (lagu) sing (a song)
berisi (air) contain (water)
berpindah (tempat) change (places), move (house)
 berdagang (barang-barang berharga) trade (in valuable goods)
berumur (delapan tahun) be aged (eight years)
bernama (Idrus) be named (Idrus)
bertanam (jagung) plant (corn)
berburu (rusa) hunt (deer)
berjual (ikan) sell (ﬁ sh), engage in selling (ﬁ sh) for a living
Many of these complements refer to a class of things in general, 
such as in the above example, where ayam refers to poultry in 
general, not to a speciﬁ c chicken. Some of these forms contrast 
with transitive verbs which take an object which can refer to a 
3.64

Basic clauses 277
speciﬁ c instance. Thus bertanam (jagung) ‘plant (corn)’ refers 
to a general state or occupation, whereas menanam jagung 
(itu) ‘plant (that) corn’ may refer to a single action; berburu 
rusa means ‘carry out the activity of hunting deer’, and cannot 
refer to the hunting of a particular deer, whereas memburu 
rusa (itu) ‘hunt (that) deer’ can.
Besides ber- verbs, many simple and meN- intransitive verbs 
take noun phrases as complements. With these verbs the comple-
ment is obligatory. The following examples include illustrative 
complements:
menjadi (presiden) become (president)
punya (uang) have (money)
suka (kopi) like (coffee)
mau (teh) want (tea)
tahu (hal itu) know (that matter)
 merangkap (menteri keuangan) double as (minister 
of ﬁ nance)
menyangkut (masalah politik) involve (political matters)
A few verbs with sufﬁ xes do not have a passive form and are thus 
intransitive, occurring with a complement. These are men tioned 
in section 3.25.
A number of intransitive verbs can take a complement noun 
phrase instead of a prepositional noun phrase (see also 1.219). 
Thus ke dalam ‘into’ can be omitted from the following:
Dia masuk (ke dalam) rumah.
He entered the house.
Apart from simple primary verbs, a number of secondary verbs 
take complements. These include some reciprocal verbs (see 
1.248 and 1.255), ber-…-kan verbs (see 1.262ff) and some 
ke-…-an verbs (see 1.276ff).
Intransitive report verbs can have bahwa clauses as comp-
lements (see 3.109):
Saya yakin bahwa dia pencuri.
I am sure that he is a thief.
3.65
3.66

278 Clauses
Saya berharap bahwa anda berhasil.
I hope that you succeed.
This group of verbs includes:
tahu know 
berkata say
percaya believe 
sadar be aware
ingat remember 
berpendapat have the opinion
berpikir think 
lupa forget
beranggapan have the 
  opinion, consider
A few of these verbs, such as berkata ‘say’ and berpikir ‘think’, 
can alternatively have a direct quote as complement (see 3.95).
Indirect questions (see 4.27) can also occur as complements:
Saya tidak tahu apakah dia akan datang.
I don’t know whether he will come.
With intransitive verbs reciprocity can be indicated by the 
complement satu sama lain (literally: ‘one with the other’):
Mereka kenal satu sama lain.
They know each other.
The number of intransitive verbs which can occur with adjec-
tive complements is limited:
Mereka merasa puas.
They feel satisﬁ ed.
Kakinya terasa sakit.
His foot feels sore.
Other verbs include kelihatan ‘looks, seems’ and kedengaran 
‘sounds, seems’ (see 1.283).
The verb menjadi ‘be; become’ can have both noun and adjec-
tive complements:
Suprapto sudah lama menjadi guru.
Suprapto has been a teacher for a long time.
Bapak menjadi marah.
Father became angry.

Basic clauses 279
Noun and adjective complements of transitive verbs
Some transitive verbs allow a complement to follow the object; 
this is usually called an object complement. The comp lement 
can be an adjective phrase or a noun phrase—as discussed 
here—or a verbal complement as discussed in section 3.76. The 
noun that is the object of the main verb simultaneously serves 
as the subject of the complement. In the ﬁ rst example, ibunya 
‘his mother’ is object of menjadikan ‘make’ and subject of the 
adjective predicate sedih ‘sad’; in the second example, -nya is 
the object of menganggap and subject of munaﬁ k:
Perbuatannya menjadikan ibunya sedih.
His actions made his mother sad.
Mereka menganggapnya munaﬁ k.
They consider him a hypocrite.
Some verbs, such as membuat ‘make’ and mengira ‘consider, 
reckon’, can take either an adjective phrase or noun phrase as 
complement:
Dia membuat saya marah/asistennya.
He made me angry/his assistant.
Orang sekampung mengira dia gila/pencuri.
The village people consider him mad/a thief.
Verbal complements
Some verbs can have a verbal clause as a complement. In this 
situation two verbs occur within the one clause. To distinguish 
them the terms ‘main verb’ and ‘complement verb’ are used here. 
In the clause Ibu mulai berbicara ‘Mother began to speak’ the 
main verb (sometimes called the superordinate verb) is mulai, 
while the complement verb (sometimes called the subordinate 
verb) is berbicara. Verbal complements follow an intransitive 
verb, as discussed in section 3.73. They may also follow the object 
of a transitive verb, as discussed in section 3.76.
Verbal complements of intransitive verbs
The verbal complement of an intransitive verb can itself be 
intransitive, as in the ﬁ rst two examples below, or transitive, as 
in the last two examples. The main verb and the complement 
verb have the same subject:
3.71
3.72
3.73

280 Clauses
Saya sudah berhenti merokok.
I’ve stopped smoking.
Siti mulai menangis.
Siti began to cry.
Siti ikut membantu ayah.
Siti joined in helping father.
Dia lupa menulis namanya.
He forgot to write his name.
If the complement verb is transitive it can be active, as in the 
above examples, or passive:
Keputusan pemerintah mulai dibicarakan.
The government decision began to be discussed.
Tesisnya selesai diperbaiki.
His thesis is ﬁ nished being corrected.
If the complement verb is active, the subject is the actor of 
the complement verb as well as of the main verb; Siti is actor 
of the main verb mulai ‘begin’ and of the complement verb 
menangis ‘cry’ in Siti mulai menangis ‘Siti began to cry’. If the 
complement verb is passive, the subject is its patient; keputusan 
pemerintah ‘the government decision’ is patient of dibicarakan 
‘discussed’ in Keputusan pemerintah mulai dibicarakan ‘The 
government decision began to be discussed’.
When some verbs, including berhasil ‘succeed’ and gagal ‘fail’, 
occur with a passive complement verb, they express what the 
actor of the complement verb succeeds or fails in doing, not 
what their own subject succeeds or fails in doing:
Tujuh anggota komplotan berhasil diringkus polisi.
Police succeeded in catching seven members of the gang.
Dia gagal diselamatkan.
(They) failed to save him.
If mau ‘want’ and ingin ‘want, wish’ have a passive comp lement, 
ambiguity occurs as to whether it is the subject or the agent of 
the complement who wants the action to occur. While the ﬁ rst 
sentence below is unambiguous, the second means either that 
Bill wants to be helped or that Ali wants to help him:
3.74
3.75

Basic clauses 281
Ali mau menolong Bill.
Ali wants to help Bill.
Bill mau ditolong Ali.
Bill wants to be helped by Ali. OR Ali wants to help Bill.
In practice context makes the meaning clear. Thus, while the ﬁ rst 
sentence below is ambiguous without a context, meaning either 
that beliau doesn’t want to be interviewed or that saya does 
not want to interview, the second sentence occurs in a context 
which indicates that beliau is the one who does not want to be 
interviewed:
Beliau tidak mau saya wawancarai.
 I don’t want to interview him. OR He doesn’t want me to 
interview him.
Kalau beliau tidak mau saya wawancarai, tidak apa-apa.
If he doesn’t want me to interview him, it doesn’t matter.
The ﬁ rst sentence below would automatically be interpreted as 
meaning that the agent of bunuh ‘kill’ wants to perform the act, 
while the second, which occurs with question intonation, clearly 
means that the subject wants the act to be performed:
Kau mau kubunuh.
I want to kill you.
Kau mau kubunuh, ya?
You want me to kill you, eh?
If the subject is inanimate, the one who wants is clearly the agent 
of the complement:
Bagian kalimat ini ingin ditegaskannya.
He wanted to emphasise this part of the sentence.
Verbal complements of transitive verbs
As mentioned in section 3.71, the complement of a transitive 
verb follows the object and is a type of object comp lement. 
The object of the main verb is simultaneously subject of the 
complement verb. Thus in the ﬁ rst example below anaknya 
‘his children’ is object of menyuruh ‘order’ and subject of 
pergi ‘go’:
3.76

282 Clauses
Suwono menyuruh anaknya pergi ke sekolah.
Suwono ordered his children to go to school.
 Polisi menghentikan para demonstran memasuki kampus.
The police stopped the demonstrators entering the campus.
As the main verb is transitive it has a corresponding passive 
form (see 3.26). In the passive the complement remains after 
the main verb. In such constructions the subject is patient of 
the main verb and actor of the complement verb. The ﬁ rst two 
examples below of passive main verbs with complements are 
preceded by their active counterparts. The ﬁ nal example has a 
transitive ke-…-an verb (see 1.283):
Dia menyuruh saya pergi.
He ordered me to go.
Saya disuruh pergi.
I was ordered to go.
Mereka menugasi saya melakukan observasi.
They assigned me to carry out observations.
Saya ditugasi mereka melakukan observasi.
I was assigned by them to carry out observations.
Bangkai mobil dibiarkan bertumpuk.
Car wrecks were allowed to pile up.
Pak Sarif ditunjuk pemerintah mengurus pabrik itu.
 Mr Sarif was appointed by the government to manage the 
factory.
Pak Sujud kelihatan membakar kemenyan.
Mr Sujud could be seen burning incense.
Complements with untuk
Some complement verbs refer to an action which occurs in the 
future with respect to the main verb, which can be intrans itive 
or transitive. The complement can optionally be preceded by 
untuk. Untuk clauses are discussed in sections 3.113ff.
Although untuk can always be omitted from a comp lement 
(see 3.116), it cannot always be added; many transitive verbs 
do not allow an untuk clause as complement. These include 
verbs whose complement verb refers to an action taking place 
at the same time as the main verb. In this category are verbs of 
3.77
3.78

Basic clauses 283
perception, such as melihat ‘see’, mendengar ‘hear’, mengamati 
‘observe’, and numerous other verbs, such as mempergoki 
‘catch’. These verbs take an object complement as described 
in section 3.76:
 Polisi mengamatinya menelpon sejumlah orang dari 
terminal.
 Police observed him telephone a number of people from 
the terminal.
 Kami mempergoki dia sedang mencoba membuka lemari 
besi.
We caught him trying to open a safe.
Complements with untuk must be distinguished from 
subordinate clauses beginning with untuk (and guna). The 
complement is an essential part of the clause; if it is omitted 
the construction is incomplete. On the other hand a subordi-
n ate clause, while adding further information, is not obliga-
tory. A further difference is that untuk is optional before a 
comp lement but obligatory before a subordinate clause. 
Subordinate clauses introduced by untuk are discussed in 
section 4.74.
Complements with supaya and agar
Transitive and intransitive verbs which indicate that the subject 
intends someone else to perform an action can take a comple-
ment introduced by supaya, agar or, more formally, agar supaya 
‘that, so that’. Verbs which can take a complement introduced by 
supaya/agar include:
ingin want, desire 
menghendaki want
berharap hope 
menyuruh order, tell
hendak want 
mempersilakan invite
mau want 
memerintakhan instruct
berkeinginan desire 
meng(h)imbau appeal
berpesan instruct 
menyerukan appeal
berusaha endeavour 
menasihati advise
bercita-cita desire 
(me)mohon request
mendesak urge 
(me)minta request
mengajak invite, urge 
mengusulkan suggest
3.79
3.80

284 Clauses
menuntut demand 
menginginkan want, desire
mengharapkan hope, expect menginstruksikan instruct
Clauses introduced by supaya/agar are discussed in sections 
3.119ff.
Complements with supaya/agar must be distinguished from 
subordinate clauses beginning with the same conjunction. The 
complement is an essential part of the clause; if it is omitted, 
the construction is incomplete. On the other hand a subordi-
nate clause, while adding further information, is not obliga-
tory. Subordinate clauses introduced by supaya or agar are 
discussed in section 4.74.
Complements with sebagai
While similar to an adjunct, a prepositional phrase with sebagai 
is essential to the meaning of the clause, which is therefore 
incomplete without it. As such these constructions are comp-
lements, which link directly to either the subject or object of 
the clause.
A complement with sebagai can occur with some intransi-
tive verbs to indicate what role or function the subject has:
Dia bekerja di sana sebagai tukang kayu.
He works there as a carpenter.
 Bahasa Indonesia berfungsi sebagai alat pemersatu bangsa.
Indonesian functions as the national uniﬁ er.
The complement can occur with some transitive verbs and 
describes the (presumed) role of the patient. The patient can be 
object of an active clause or subject of a passive clause:
Panitia memilih Djunawi sebagai ketua sidang pleno.
 The committee chose Djunawi as the president of the general 
session.
 Harian Kompas memandang keputusan pemerintah 
sebagai langkah mundur.
 The daily Kompas regards the government decision as a 
backward step.
Mereka dicap sebagai bandit.
They were branded as bandits.
3.81
3.82

Basic clauses 285
Kacong dianggap polisi sebagai penjahat.
Kacong was considered by the police to be a criminal.
Complements of adjective clauses
There are two types of verbal complement in adjectival clauses. 
In one type the subject of the main clause is also actor of the 
complement verb, discussed in section 3.84. In the other the 
subject of the main clause stands as patient of the complement 
verb, discussed in section 3.85.
A limited number of adjectives can take an active verb as a 
complement. The adjective then indicates the manner in which 
the subject performs the action. In these constructions the 
adjective is the predicate centre and can be negated; it does 
not function as an adverb within a verbal clause. The following 
verb usually occurs as a ‘to-inﬁ nitive’ verb in the English trans-
lation. Adjectives which can take such a complement include 
pandai ‘clever, capable’ (translated in this construction as ‘able, 
capable’), berani ‘brave’ (translated in this construction as 
‘dare’) and gembira ‘delighted’:
Ratna pandai berenang.
Ratna is able to swim.
Dia tidak berani membantah pendapat guru.
He wouldn’t dare contradict the teacher’s opinion.
Saya gembira mendengar berita itu.
I was delighted to hear the news.
Other adjectives able to take such complements include:
takut afraid 
malu embarrassed
senang happy 
bangga proud
segan reluctant 
cenderung inclined
A limited number of adjectives can take a verbal comp lement 
in which the verb is passive and the adjective describes the 
way in which the subject noun undergoes the action. Adjec-
tives occurring in this construction include sukar ‘difﬁ cult’, 
sulit ‘difﬁ cult’ and mudah ‘easy’. Untuk optionally begins the 
complement:
3.83
3.84
3.85

286 Clauses
Tulisan saudara sulit (untuk) dibaca.
Your writing is hard to read.
Kata-kata baru ini sukar (untuk) saya ingat.
These new words are hard for me to remember.
Jawabannya tidak mudah dimengerti.
His answer wasn’t easy to understand.
Other adjectives taking such complements include:
menarik interesting 
enak pleasant
gampang easy 
patut appropriate
baik good
In Indonesian a verb must be passive if the subject noun iden-
tiﬁ es its patient. This is also the case where the verb occurs in 
an embedded clause as in the above constructions. Thus, 
in the ﬁ rst example above tulisan ‘writing’ stands as patient of 
the verb ‘read’; the verb must therefore be in its passive form 
dibaca. (This rule does not apply in English, where the verb is 
usually active, as in the above examples.) This rule also applies 
in relative clauses, and is further discussed in relation to such 
constructions (see 3.99).
These constructions can be transformed into the construc-
tions discussed in sections 3.10–11.
Verbal complements are also possible with many other adjec-
tives when modiﬁ ed by the adverbs terlalu and cukup. Untuk 
obligatorily introduces the complement:
Sepatu ini terlalu mahal untuk kami beli.
These shoes are too expensive for us to buy.
Papaya ini sudah cukup masak untuk dimakan.
This papaw is already ripe enough to eat.
DERIVED CLAUSES
Derived clauses are constructions which are best described with 
reference to changes undergone by basic clauses. Some derived 
clauses are independent; that is, they can occur alone as a 
sentence. These are topic-comment clauses (see 3.87), identifying 
clauses (see 3.92) and direct quote clauses (see 3.95). Others are 
dependent; that is, they cannot occur alone as a sentence. These 
3.86

Derived clauses 287
include relative clauses (see 3.97), bahwa clauses (see 3.108), 
untuk clauses (see 3.113), supaya/agar clauses (see 3.119) and 
nominalised clauses (see 3.130).
Topic-comment clauses
In addition to the nuclear components occurring in 
basic clauses (see 3.2), a topic-comment clause contains an 
additional nuclear component, the topic. Topic-comment 
clauses are used to highlight a particular noun phrase. This 
phrase is taken from the basic clause and placed before it, 
becoming the topic. The rest of the clause is then a comment 
on the topic. The place from which the topic is taken is marked 
by -nya. There are two types of topic-comment clause: those 
whose topic is based on a possessor, called here possessor 
topic-comment clauses, and those whose topic is based on an 
object, called here object topic-comment clauses.
Possessor topic-comment clauses
This construction is based on a clause whose subject noun 
phrase contains a possessor. The possessor is placed before the 
clause, becoming the topic. Its place in the subject is marked by 
-nya. This process is illustrated by the following example, the 
basic clause being given ﬁ rst, then the topic-comment clause:
Nama sopir itu Pak Ali.
The name of that driver is Mr Ali.
Sopir itu namanya Pak Ali.
Concerning that driver, his name is Mr Ali.
In the basic clause above, the subject is nama sopir itu ‘the 
name of that driver’. The possessor, sopir itu ‘that driver’, 
becomes the topic, its place being marked by -nya. Thus in the 
topic-comment clause the topic is sopir itu ‘that driver’ and 
the comment is namanya Pak Ali ‘his name is Mr Ali’. A topic-
comment clause has the force of ‘as for [topic], …’ or ‘concern-
ing [topic], …’, as in the above example. Such a construction 
is, however, frequently unnatural in English, although used in 
the above example to convey the force of this construction. The 
emphasis on the topic is accompanied by a rise in pitch (rising 
intonation). A slight pause may also occur after the topic; in 
3.87
3.88

288 Clauses
writing, a comma can but need not follow the topic. The trans-
lations of the following examples do not necessarily convey the 
force of the Indonesian construction:
Jakarta wajahnya sudah mulai berubah.
The face of Jakarta has begun to change.
Para pegawai gajinya tidak akan naik.
The salary of the employees will not rise.
Teman saya, anaknya tiga.
My friend, he has three children.
Mahasiswa itu, rambutnya tidak pernah disisir.
That student, his hair is never combed.
The place of the topic in the subject is always marked by -nya, 
even if it is plural:
Mereka adiknya dipanggil polisi.
 (As for them) their brother has been summoned by the 
police.
Some Indonesians accept a ﬁ rst or second person topic, such as 
the following, while others reject this construction:5
Saya asalnya dari Semarang.
(As for me) I’m from Semarang.
In informal speech it is common to put kalau before the topic:
Kalau Pak Yanto, anaknya sudah kawin.
As for Mr Yanto, his children are already married.
The topic can be a demonstrative pronoun (see 2.65), as in the 
following example; in this case the basic clause can be regarded 
as containing a possessive noun, such as nama benda ini ‘the 
name of this thing’:
Ini namanya Monas, Monumen Nasional.
 This is named Monas, the National Monument. (literally: 
‘(As for) this, its name is Monas, the National Monument.’)
With some possessor topic-comment clauses foregrounding of 
the predicate is also possible, by placing it before the subject. 
Thus the ﬁ rst example above could be changed to:
3.89

Derived clauses 289
Jakarta sudah mulai berubah wajahnya.
The face of Jakarta has begun to change.
If the predicate precedes the subject a comma is not placed after 
the topic in writing and in speech there is usually no pause. The 
predicate can only precede the subject if the subject is some-
thing inalienably possessed by the topic. This is shown by the 
following example. In the ﬁ rst construction the thing possessed 
by the topic Pak Ali is mata ‘eyes’. Eyes are something inalien-
ably possessed, something intrinsic to or part of the possessor. In 
the ﬁ rst construction, therefore, the subject can occur after the 
predicate. In the second construction the thing possessed is istri 
‘wife’. However, a wife is not something inalienably possessed, it 
is not part of the possessor; Pak Ali remains the same without 
a wife. Consequently, the subject of this construction cannot 
follow the predicate:6
Pak Ali matanya dioperasi.
Pak Ali dioperasi matanya.
Mr Ali’s eyes were operated on.
Pak Ali istrinya dioperasi.
Mr Ali’s wife was operated on.
The following examples of topic-comment constructions with 
inverted subject and predicate all refer to inalienable possession:
Mereka itu kolot pikirannya.
Their thinking is old-fashioned.
Dilihat dari bawah, orang itu seperti semut saja besarnya.
 Seen from below, those people look as big as ants. (literally: 
‘… those people, their size is like an ant.’)
Golongan itu bertambah hari bertambah kuat suaranya.
The voice of that group gets stronger by the day.
The pronouns formed from collective numbers, as in section 
2.94, and indeﬁ nite numbers, as in section 2.95, can occur 
as subject of a topic-comment construction whose topic 
identiﬁ es the noun they refer to. Although there is not a 
possessor–possessed re lationship between topic and subject, 
the construction is based on analogy with the possessor topic-
comment form:
3.90

290 Clauses
Saudagar itu ketiga-tiganya berasal dari Jepara.
All three of those merchants come from Jepara.
Anak ini semuanya berasal dari Nusa Tenggara.
All of these children come from Nusa Tenggara.
Object topic-comment clauses
These derive from active transitive clauses. The object of the 
basic clause goes to the front as topic, while its place after the 
verb is taken by -nya. The ﬁ rst clause below is a basic active 
construction and the second is the topic-comment clause 
derived from it:
Saya belum menerima surat itu.
I haven’t received that letter yet.
Surat itu, saya belum menerimanya.
Concerning that letter, I haven’t received it yet.
The object of an active verb cannot precede the verb (see 3.48). 
However, in object topic-comment clauses what was object in 
the basic clause, surat itu in the above example, is no longer 
object but topic. The object is -nya, which remains after the 
verb, allowing the verb to be active. As the above example 
shows, the word order in the comment undergoes no change. 
For comparison, the corresponding passive of the above basic 
clause is:
Surat itu belum saya terima.
I haven’t received that letter yet.
As with possessor topic-comment clauses, a comma optionally 
occurs after the topic in writing. Other examples:
 Apa yang terjadi kemudian, anda sendiri mungkin pernah 
mengalaminya.
 What happened next you yourself have possibly experienced.
Kebiasaan yang buruk itu susah merubahnya.
That bad habit is hard to change.
Object topic-comment clauses can sometimes occur as relative 
clauses, as discussed in section 3.105.
3.91

Derived clauses 291
Identifying clauses
An identifying construction is another method of focusing 
attention on a particular element of a clause. Identifying 
clauses correspond to what are called cleft sentences in English, 
although their structure is quite different. The following clause 
is a neutral statement:
Orang itu mencuri dompet saya.
That person stole my wallet.
If we want to clarify who was responsible for the action, in this 
case orang itu, we can use an identifying clause construction:
Orang itu yang mencuri dompet saya.
It is that person who stole my wallet.
Here orang itu acts as the predicate and the rest of the clause, 
beginning with yang, is a nominalised relative clause (see 
3.131) and acts as subject. Such constructions are commonly 
used when the event or state expressed in the yang clause, in 
this case mencuri dompet saya, is presupposed, either because 
it was previously mentioned or can otherwise be assumed from 
context. These clauses can be translated by cleft sentences, as 
in the above example, or by constructions like ‘That person is 
the one who stole my wallet’. 
Identifying clauses are far more frequent in Indonesian than 
cleft sentences in English where, at least in speech, it is more 
common simply to stress the ﬁ rst word of the phrase: ‘That 
person stole my wallet’. The identifying clause in Indonesian is 
also accompanied by extra stress on the ﬁ rst phrase. Because 
the predicate occurs before the subject, it is foregrounded or 
highlighted (see 3.42–4) and can optionally be marked by 
foregrounding particle -lah (see 3.51):
Wayang kulitlah yang paling kami gemari.
It is the wayang kulit that we most admire.
 Faktor politiklah yang terutama mempengaruhi 
hukum.
Political factors are what most inﬂ uence the law.
Hadi yang berangkat tadi.
It was Hadi who left just now.
3.92

292 Clauses
The predicate can be a personal pronoun or, as occurs commonly, 
a demonstrative pronoun:
Inilah yang paling lezat, sehat dan segar.
It is this which is most delicious, healthy and fresh.
As the predicate is a noun phrase, it is negated by bukan:
Bukan saya yang selalu terlambat.
It isn’t me who’s always late.
Many Indonesians do not allow question words siapa ‘who’ and 
apa ‘what’ to be the subject of a basic passive clause. Instead, 
they must occur in identifying constructions. This is discussed 
in section 4.16.
The order of subject and predicate cannot be reversed in an 
identifying clause; reversal of order produces a basic clause in 
which the subject is a nominalised relative clause (see 3.131–2). 
In each of the pairs of constructions below the ﬁ rst is an identi-
fying clause, which has rising intonation on the predicate, while 
the second is a basic clause, with normal intonation pattern:
Pakaian yang saya beli.
It was clothes that I bought.
Yang saya beli pakaian.
What I bought was clothes.
Pak Hasjim(lah) yang mendirikan sekolah itu.
It was Mr Hasjim who founded that school.
Yang mendirikan sekolah itu (adalah) Pak Hasjim.
The one who founded that school was Mr Hasjim.
Direct quote clauses
Some verbs report what someone said. The object of such 
verbs, or the complement if they are intransitive (see 3.61), is 
a direct quote, sometimes called direct speech. In writing, this 
is placed within quotation marks and is usually preceded by a 
comma:
Dia berkata, ‘Terima kasih’.
He said, ‘Thank you’.
Dewi menjawab, ‘Betul’.
Dewi replied, ‘That is correct’.
3.93
3.94
3.95

Derived clauses 293
These clauses are here called direct quote clauses. A person’s words 
can also be indirectly reported, as discussed in section 3.109.
As well as basic direct quote clauses discussed above, there 
are corresponding quote clauses in which the direct speech is 
placed ﬁ rst for emphasis. When the direct speech is placed ﬁ rst 
it is followed by a quote noun plus possessor, never by a verb of 
speaking:
‘Terima kasih,’ katanya.
‘Thank you,’ he said. (literally: ‘his utterance’)
‘Betul,’ jawab Dewi.
‘That is correct,’ replied Dewi. (literally: ‘Dewi’s reply’)
The direct speech can be anything from a single word to a long 
construction. It can be a question, command or exclamation 
as well as a statement. For each of the following examples the 
subject and verb of the corresponding verbal clause are also 
given:
‘Saya diperlakukan tak adil,’ teriak terhukum.
[Terhukum berteriak, ‘…]
‘I’ve been treated unjustly,’ shouted the sentenced man.
‘Siapa itu?’ tanyaku. [Aku bertanya, ‘…]
‘Who is that?’ I asked.
‘Saya sudah mengundang dia,’ tambahnya.
[Dia menambahkan, ‘…]
I’ve already invited him,’ he added.
 ‘Diusulkan agar saya belajar di Belanda,’ lanjut Kristiyanto.
[Kristiyanto melanjutkan, ‘…]
 ‘It was suggested that I study in Holland’, continued Kristiyanto.
The direct speech can be broken up, with the quote noun phrase 
being inserted within the two parts of the quote:
 ‘Kalau gajinya tidak cukup,’ ujarnya, ‘jangan bekerja di sana’.
‘If the salary isn’t enough,’ he said, ‘don’t work there’.
Some other quote nouns are the following, with -nya ‘she/he’ 
given as possessor:
gerutunya he grumbled 
tegasnya she asserted
jelasnya she explained 
pikirnya he thought
3.96

294 Clauses
ceritanya she related 
ucapnya he pronounced
sahutnya he responded 
bentaknya he snapped
tulisnya she wrote 
guraunya she joked
The quote noun phrase may be followed by a number of other 
clause components, such as prepositional phrases indicating 
who was spoken to, the manner in which it was said and 
so on:
‘Ke sini!’ bisiknya kepadaku.
‘Here!’ he whispered to me.
‘Kami masih berteman,’ ujarnya dengan lemah-lembut.
‘We’re still friends,’ she said softly.
‘Itu bukan maksudku,’ katanya sambil tersenyum.
‘That’s not what I meant,’ she said while smiling.
Relative clauses
One way of adding information about a noun is by incorporat-
ing a clause within the noun phrase. This clause is preceded by 
yang and is called a relative clause. The head of the noun phrase 
corresponds to some component within the relative clause. 
The noun phrase within which the relative clause occurs, or is 
embedded, is called the embedding phrase.
There are a number of different types of relative clause. The 
most common of these is the deﬁ ning relative clause, described 
in sections 3.98–102 and usually referred to simply as a relative 
clause. Other relative clauses are topic-comment relative clauses, 
described in sections 3.103–5, and prepositional relative clauses, 
described in section 3.106. A fourth type of relative clause is not 
preceded by yang. This is the locative relative clause, discussed 
in section 3.107.
Deﬁ ning relative clauses
A deﬁ ning relative clause is one whose subject corresponds 
to the head noun of the embedding phrase. In the following 
sections a deﬁ ning relative clause is referred to just as a relative 
clause, being by far the most common type of relative clause. 
The clause is incorporated, or embedded, within the noun 
phrase by: (i) deleting its subject, which is identical to the head 
noun of the embedding phrase, and (ii) placing yang before it. 
3.97
3.98

Derived clauses 295
Thus, the following independent clause: (a) Orang itu duduk 
dekat jendela ‘That person is sitting near the window’ can be 
embedded within the subject noun phrase of the following 
clause: (b) Orang itu bekerja dengan saya ‘That person works 
with me’ by the two steps above, giving: (c) Orang yang duduk 
dekat jendela itu bekerja dengan saya ‘The person who is sitting 
near the window works with me’.
The italicised part in (c) is the relative clause; it derives from 
(a) by the steps (i) and (ii) above and occurs within the subject 
of (c). The subject of (c) ends with optional itu. Although itu 
identiﬁ es the subject of (b), this is also achieved by the relative 
clause; in this case, itu is more likely to be omitted from the 
embedding phrase. In journalistic style a long relative clause 
is sometimes placed after a demonstrative. This is discussed in 
section 2.60.
In Indonesian yang must occur before a relative clause, 
although in English corresponding ‘who’ or ‘that’ can some-
times be omitted:
Mobil yang ditubruk truk itu rusak sama sekali.
The car (that was) hit by the truck is a complete wreck.
Orang yang berkumpul di depan pintu harus pindah.
 The people (who are) gathering in front of the door will have 
to move.
Celana yang dibelinya kemarin terlalu kecil.
The trousers (that) he bought yesterday are too small.
A relative clause can contain any constituent occurring in an 
independent clause except the subject, which is identical to the 
head of the embedding noun phrase. Since the head noun stands 
in the same relationship to the verb as the subject of the clause, 
that relationship must be shown by the verb. If the re lationship 
is that of actor, the verb must be active:
orang yang membangun rumah saya
the person who built my house
If the noun stands as patient, the verb must be passive:
tanah yang sudah digarap
land that has been worked
3.99

296 Clauses
The rule that the verb must be passive following a noun which 
stands as patient to it can cause difﬁ culty for English speakers as 
in English the verb can be, and usually is, active in this context:
Rumah yang dibangun Pak Dani tidak begitu besar.
The house Mr Dani built isn’t very big.
Bis yang saya naiki tidak berhenti di Jalan Pramuka.
The bus I got didn’t stop at Pramuka Road.
Dokter yang kami telpon segera datang.
The doctor who we called quickly came.
Verbal sufﬁ xes remain unchanged in relative clauses. Thus the 
head noun can have any participant role that the subject of an 
independent passive clause has. In the ﬁ rst example below the 
head noun stands as recipient and in the second it stands as 
beneﬁ ciary:
Beberapa orang yang dikirimi surat belum menjawab.
 Several of the people who were sent letters have not yet 
replied.
Pemuda yang dicarikan pekerjaan sangat berterima kasih.
The youth for whom work was sought was very thankful.
Sections 3.98–100 refer only to verbal relative clauses. Relative 
clauses can also derive from other basic clause types. The follow-
ing are some examples of noun phrases containing non-verbal 
relative clauses. The ﬁ rst is an adjective relative clause (further 
discussed in section 2.45), followed by prepositional relative 
clauses:
mobil yang biru
the blue car
orang yang di sini tadi
the person who was here a while ago
anak yang seperti Tini
children who are like Tini
Noun relative clauses rarely occur. Normally yang cannot 
precede a noun. However, a noun relative clause can be used 
when the speaker wishes to distinguish a person from other 
people with similar characteristics, especially the same name:
3.100
3.101

Derived clauses 297
Soeharto yang presiden
Soeharto who was president (not some other Soeharto)
Moreover, there is a growing tendency, especially in journal-
istic style, to allow noun relative clauses to add information 
about the head noun rather than to identify, although this is not 
acceptable to all speakers:
 Pemerintah mengizinkan Zardari, yang juga anggota 
parlemen, untuk menghadiri sidang.
 The government allowed Zadari, who is also a member of 
parliament, to attend the session.
Ibu Alieva, yang seorang ibu, akan kami jemput.
Mrs Alieva, who is a woman, will be met by us.
A number of relative clauses can occur within the one noun 
phrase. The following example contains adjective and verbal 
relative clauses:
 pertambangan-pertambangan yang penting yang meng-
hasilkan bahan tambang strategis
important mines which produce strategic minerals
Topic-comment relative clauses
Both possessor topic-comment clauses (see 3.88) and object 
topic-comment clauses (see 3.91) can be embedded in noun 
phrases. The topic of the topic-comment clause is deleted; the 
noun of the embedding phrase then stands as topic (not subject) 
to the relative clause. The -nya in the relative clause identiﬁ es 
the head of the noun phrase.
Possessor topic-comment relative clauses meaning ‘whose’
In possessor topic-comment relative clauses, which translate 
constructions with ‘whose’ in English, the subject of the relative 
clause is the thing possessed by the head noun. The ﬁ rst example 
below derives from the independent topic-comment clause 
Sopir itu namanya Ali ‘That driver’s name is Ali’:
sopir yang namanya Ali
the driver whose name is Ali
orang yang mobilnya dicuri
the person whose car was stolen
3.102
3.103
3.104

298 Clauses
jalan yang panjangnya sekitar 18 kilometer
a road whose length is about 18 kilometres
If the subject of a topic-comment clause is something inalienably 
possessed by the topic it can occur after the predicate, as discussed 
in section 3.89. This rule also applies in relative topic-comment 
clauses:
 lima puluh empat negara Afrika yang diakui kedaulatan-
nya
ﬁ fty-four African nations whose sovereignty is recognised
kawasan yang dipuji kebersihannya ini
this region whose cleanliness has been praised
seorang pejabat yang tidak akan disebutkan namanya
an ofﬁ cial whose name will not be mentioned
 gadis yang kami kagumi kecantikan dan kelembutannya 
itu
the girl whose beauty and gentleness we admired
Object topic-comment relative clauses
The head of the embedding phrase is identical to the object of 
the relative clause and is marked by -nya occurring in object 
position within the clause. While these constructions do occur, 
they are sometimes considered convoluted or stylistically inap-
propriate by many speakers. In the ﬁ rst example below, the head 
of the embedding phrase harapan ‘hope’ is also object of the 
verb menyelesaikan ‘fulﬁ l’:
 Saya banyak menciptakan harapan bagi rakyat yang saya 
sendiri tidak mampu menyelesaikannya.
 I created many hopes for the people which I myself was not 
able to fulﬁ l.
senjata yang tidak setiap musuh bisa menghadapinya
weapons which not every enemy can face
sebuah lagu yang barangkali saudara akan menyukainya
a song which perhaps you will like
Prepositional relative clauses
In these constructions the head of the embedding phrase is 
not identical to the subject (or topic) of the relative clause. 
Instead, it is identical to the noun in a prepositional phrase 
3.105
3.106

Derived clauses 299
(see 2.118) within the relative clause. The noun following the 
preposition is deleted and replaced by -nya. The following 
basic clause contains a prepositional phrase as an adjunct of 
location (see 2.208):
Di belakang rumah itu ada pohon mangga.
Behind that house there is a mango tree.
This can be embedded in a noun phrase whose head is rumah 
‘house’. Rumah itu is deleted from the prepositional phrase and 
its place taken by -nya:
rumah yang di belakangnya ada pohon mangga
the house behind which there is a mango tree
The prepositional phrase may also contain a longer noun 
phrase; the whole of this is deleted from the relative clause as it 
also occurs in the embedding phrase. The prepositional locative 
adjunct in the following basic clause contains the phrase grup 
vokal itu ‘that vocal group’:
Ada empat penyanyi di dalam grup vokal itu.
There are four members in that vocal group.
The whole phrase is deleted from the relative clause and replaced 
by -nya:
grup vokal yang di dalamnya ada empat penyanyi itu
that vocal group in which there are four singers
In such constructions the preposition with -nya occurs at the 
beginning of the relative clause, immediately after yang. The 
preposition involved is usually a locative preposition, as in 
the examples above and the ﬁ rst example below. In the other 
examples below it is the recipient preposition kepada ‘to’ and 
the benefactive preposition untuk ‘for’:
meja yang di atasnya tersedia makanan
the table on which food is set
toko buku yang di depannya ada kafe
the bookshop that has a café in front of it
majalah yang di sampul belakangnya ada foto dirinya
a magazine that has her photo on the back cover

300 Clauses
Locative relative clauses
These differ from other relative clauses in that they are not 
preceded by yang. The more traditional construction begins 
with tempat, translated ‘where’:
Pabrik tempat mereka bekerja tidak jauh dari sini.
The factory where they work is not far from here.
Although some people still regard this as the only acceptable 
form, it is more commonly replaced by di mana in the present-
day language:
pabrik di mana mereka bekerja
the factory where they work
Based on analogy with this form, constructions with dari 
mana ‘from where, from which’ and dalam mana ‘in which’ are 
becoming more common in journalistic style, although unac-
ceptable to many people:
pangkalan dari mana roket itu dilepaskan
the base from which the rocket was launched
 surat-surat cinta dalam mana dia berjanji akan mengawini 
gadis-gadis itu
love letters in which he promised to marry those girls
Bahwa clauses
Any statement can follow bahwa ‘that’; these correspond to 
‘that’ clauses in English. A bahwa clause behaves like a noun 
phrase and can occur in a number of positions where nouns 
usually occur.
The most frequent occurrence of a bahwa clause is as object 
of a transitive verb or as complement of an intransitive verb 
(see 3.66). As such it introduces indirect speech, also called an 
indirect quote, which can be used instead of direct speech (see 
3.95):
Dia menjawab, ‘Saya tidak percaya’.
He replied, ‘I don’t believe it’.
Dia menjawab bahwa dia tidak percaya.
He replied that he didn’t believe it.
3.107
3.108
3.109

Derived clauses 301
Bahwa clauses most frequently occur as objects or comp lements 
of verbs which report something that happened or report what 
someone said; only the latter group can replace the bahwa 
clause by a direct quote. These are usually called reporting verbs 
in grammars of English and many of them rarely, if ever, have a 
noun as an object:
Dia sadar bahwa dia telah ditipu.
He was aware that he had been tricked.
Kami percaya bahwa kami dapat mengatasi kesukaran ini.
We believe that we can overcome this difﬁ culty.
 Kami mengakui bahwa kami perlu bantuan dari luar 
negeri.
We acknowledge that we need help from overseas.
A list of intransitive verbs which can have a bahwa clause as 
complement is given in section 3.66.
When a bahwa clause is object or complement, bahwa can 
be omitted:
Saya tahu (bahwa) dia pencuri.
I know (that) he is a thief.
 Dia memperkirakan (bahwa) Indonesia membutuhkan 
tiga ribu pilot baru.
 He estimates (that) Indonesia needs three thousand new pilots.
If the subject of the bahwa clause is the same as the subject of 
the main clause, it can be omitted along with bahwa:
 Mereka berjanji bahwa mereka tidak akan merongrong 
pemerintah.
 They promised that they would not undermine the 
government.
Mereka berjanji tidak akan merongrong pemerintah.
They promised not to undermine the government.
Dia mengancam bahwa dia akan membunuh saya.
He threatened that he would kill me.
Dia mengancam akan membunuh saya.
He threatened to kill me.
A bahwa clause can occur within a noun phrase, modifying the 
head noun (see also 2.54):
3.110

302 Clauses
 Kabar bahwa gaji pegawai akan naik menggembirakan 
kami.
The news that employees’ wages would rise delighted us.
Tudingan bahwa Bung Karno terlibat makin santer.
 Accusations that Bung Karno was involved became more 
and more frequent.
It can also occur as the predicate of a noun clause. A copula 
usually precedes bahwa (an example is given in section 3.6).
A bahwa clause can occur in subject position. As subject it 
usually follows the predicate. Corresponding to such clauses in 
English are constructions whose subject is impersonal ‘it’, with 
the ‘that’ clause following the predicate. In formal English the 
‘that’ clause may precede the verb as the sole subject, as given 
as an alternative translation to the ﬁ rst example below. The 
bahwa clause may also precede the predicate, although this is 
not common:
Jelas bahwa dia ingin menipu kita.
 It is clear that he wants to cheat us. (That he wants to cheat 
us is clear.)
Bukanlah rahasia lagi bahwa dia suka pada Irma.
It is no longer a secret that he likes Irma.
Belum disadari bahwa helm dapat mencegah luka berat.
It isn’t yet realised that a helmet can prevent serious injury.
 Bahwa kabar itu tidak benar diumumkan oleh yang 
berwajib.
 That the news was not true was announced by the authorities.
If the bahwa clause is in subject position and follows the predi-
cate, bahwa can be deleted; if it precedes the predicate, bahwa 
cannot be deleted:
 Tidak dapat disangkal (bahwa) ﬁ lm mempunyai pengaruh 
besar.
It cannot be denied that movies have a big inﬂ uence.
 Bahwa ﬁ lm mempunyai pengaruh besar tidak dapat 
disangkal.
That movies have a big inﬂ uence cannot be denied.
3.111
3.112

Derived clauses 303
Untuk clauses
An untuk clause often corresponds to an inﬁ nitive to-verb clause 
in English. An untuk clause obligatorily loses its subject, as the 
subject is always identical with some component of the main 
clause within which the untuk clause occurs. Untuk clauses can 
occur as subject, predicate and complement.
As well as not having a subject, an untuk clause allows very 
few predicate components; in addition to the verb, only tidak is 
at all frequent:
Dia memutuskan untuk tidak menolong mereka.
He decided not to help them.
Occurring as predicate, an untuk clause is frequently preceded 
by a copula. This is further discussed, with an example, in 
section 3.6.
Occurring as subject, an untuk clause usually follows the predi-
cate (see 3.45). The English translation frequently has an ‘antici-
patory “it” subject’, as discussed in section 3.112:
 Penting sekali bagi negara-negara Arab untuk memelihara 
hubungan dengan Iran.
 It is very important for the Arab countries to maintain 
relations with Iran.
Tidak semudah itu untuk mengubah sikap penduduk.
It isn’t as easy as that to change the attitude of the people.
Untuk can be omitted when the untuk clause occurs as subject, 
in which case the clause becomes a simple nominal clause (see 
3.143):
Untuk mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
To ﬁ nd work in the city isn’t very easy.
Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
Finding work in the city isn’t very easy.
An untuk clause can occur as complement of transitive and 
intransitive verbs to indicate an action which occurs after the 
action of the main verb:
Mereka bersedia untuk menurunkan harga.
They are prepared to lower prices.
3.113
3.114
3.115
3.116

304 Clauses
 Pemberontak berencana untuk melancarkan operasi baru.
The rebels plan to launch a new operation.
Mereka dipanggil untuk mengambil bagian.
They were called to take part.
Pemerintah mengizinkan dia untuk menghadiri sidang.
The government permitted him to attend the session.
Untuk can always be omitted, in which case the complement 
functions like the verbal complements discussed in sections 
3.73 and 3.76. The last example above can also be:
Pemerintah mengizinkan dia menghadiri sidang.
The government permitted him to attend the session.
The likelihood of untuk occurring depends on a number of 
factors. When the clause is a complement untuk rarely occurs 
following some main verbs, such as mencoba ‘try’, while it is rarely 
absent after some other verbs, such as memutuskan ‘decide’:
Saya mencoba (untuk) merokok Dji Sam Soe.
I tried to smoke Dji Sam Soe cigarettes.
Saya memutuskan untuk pergi.
I decided to go.
Some transitive verbs have no object but are directly followed 
by an untuk complement. This occurs when the subject of the 
complement verb is identical with the subject of the main verb:
Dia mengelak untuk menjawab langsung.
He avoided answering directly.
 Menteri memutuskan untuk memberitahu para 
wartawan.
The minister decided to tell the journalists.
 Dia menolak untuk menyebutkan jumlah pesawat yang 
diperlukan.
 He refused to state the number of planes which were 
required.
Untuk is also optional in this situation:
Dia mengelak menjawab langsung.
He avoided answering directly.
3.117

Derived clauses 305
In such constructions the untuk clause must be regarded as a 
complement and not an object because the main verb cannot be 
transformed to a passive. However, the complement verb can 
be passive; the two verbs still have the same subject:
Dia menolak untuk diperiksa oleh mereka.
He refused to be investigated by them.
Untuk also occurs as a conjunction before a subord -
in ate clause of purpose (see 4.74). In this function it cannot be 
omitted.
Supaya/agar clauses
Unlike an untuk clause (see 3.113ff), a clause introduced by 
supaya or agar has a subject. A supaya/agar clause can occur as 
subject, object or complement of a clause. Subordinate clauses 
introduced by these conjunctions are discussed in section 4.74.
Transitive and intransitive verbs of intent can take a comple-
ment introduced by supaya or agar. These verbs are listed in 
section 3.80.
Occurring as a complement with intransitive verbs of intent, a 
supaya/agar clause contains a subject which is always different 
from the subject of the main clause:
Dia ingin supaya kami menolong dia.
He wants us to help him.
Bung Karno berpesan agar Dewi menasihati Martono.
Bung Karno gave instructions that Dewi advise Martono.
 Dia bercita-cita agar anaknya dilamar oleh orang kaya saja.
 He desires that his daughter be proposed to by no one but a 
rich man.
Transitive verbs of intent indicate that the subject intends that 
the object perform some action, which is expressed by the 
complement clause. Because the subject of the supaya/agar 
clause is identical with the object of the main clause, it is almost 
always ellipted:
3.118
3.119
3.120
3.121
3.122

306 Clauses
 Kepala kantor memerintahkan Soeparno agar mencari 
berkas itu.
The ofﬁ ce head ordered Soeparno to ﬁ nd the ﬁ le.
 Secara terbuka Muso mengajak Indonesia supaya bergan-
dengan tangan dengan Moskow.
 Muso openly urged Indonesia to go hand-in-hand with 
Moscow.
 Para pendeta Katolik menyerukan jemaatnya agar 
mengirim surat protes.
 The Catholic priests called on their congregations to send 
letters of protest.
The object of the main clause and the subject of the comp lement 
can both be expressed, although this is uncommon:
Saya menyuruhmu supaya kamu membaca buku itu.
I order you to read that book.7
As the main verb is transitive it can be made passive. Its patient 
becomes the subject in the normal way (see 3.26). However, the 
complement remains after the main verb. In such constructions 
the subject is patient of the main verb and actor of the comp-
lement verb:
Saya disuruh oleh polisi supaya pergi.
I was ordered by the police to go.
 Perdana Menteri didesak oleh rakyat agar mengambil 
langkah tegas.
 The Prime Minister was urged by the people to take ﬁ rm 
steps.
What is expressed as object of the main clause can alternatively 
be expressed as subject of the complement clause; in this case, 
the supaya/agar clause becomes object of the main clause, as 
discussed in section 3.125.
Supaya/agar can be omitted, although with many intran s - 
itive verbs the construction is awkward without it. When the 
conjunction is omitted a transitive verb is followed by an object 
and object complement, as discussed in section 3.76:
3.123

Derived clauses 307
Suwono menyuruh anaknya (supaya) pergi ke sekolah.
Suwono ordered his children to go to school.
A supaya/agar clause can be the object of a transitive verb 
under two conditions: when the original object is ellipted 
(see 3.125), or when it is reinterpreted as a recipient phrase 
(see 3.126).
When a supaya/agar clause occurs as complement of a transi-
tive verb its subject is usually ellipted, as discussed in section 
3.122. Alternatively, the object of the main clause can be ellipted, 
in which case the subject of the supaya/agar clause is retained. 
The main verb is then immediately followed by the supaya/agar 
clause:
 Dia menginstruksikan agar sopir membawa tamunya ke 
hotel.
He instructed the driver to take his guests to the hotel.
 Rukman mengingatkan agar anak buahnya tidak 
menembak.
Rukman warned his men not to shoot.
Leo menyerukan agar rakyat punya keberanian mengadu.
 Leo appealed for the people to have the courage to complain.
In constructions such as those above, the supaya/agar clause 
is the object of the main verb. It can thus become subject of a 
passive construction, as illustrated in section 3.127.
The original object of the main clause can be reinterpreted as 
a recipient, introduced by kepada ‘to’. In this case, the supaya/
agar clause is no longer a complement but is reinterpreted as 
object. It always follows the recipient phrase and its subject is 
ellipted, being the same as the recipient. In the ﬁ rst example 
below, -nya is shown both as object and as recipient:
Dokter menganjurkannya supaya berobat di Australia.
 Dokter menganjurkan Kepadanya supaya berobat di 
Australia.
The doctor urged him to get medical treatment in Australia.
3.124

3.126

308 Clauses
 Mereka menghimbau kepada Presiden Soeharto agar 
mencabut keputusan Menteri Penerangan.
 They appealed to President Soeharto to revoke the decision 
of the Minister of Information.
As subject a supaya/agar clause invariably occurs in a 
passive clause. It almost always follows other nuclear com -
pon ents of the clause:
 Diserukan agar dilancarkan aksi-aksi protes internasional 
di semua pusat operasi perusahaan itu.
 It was urged that international protest actions be launched 
in all centres of operation of the company.
Disarankannya agar mereka dikawinkan.
She advised that they be married.
If the verb of the supaya/agar clause is negated either jangan or 
tidak can occur. Although use of tidak is historically the newer 
form, it is preferred by many people:
Saya minta supaya saudara tidak/jangan pergi.
I request that you don’t go/I ask you not to go.
When the subject of a supaya/agar clause is ellipted, as discussed 
in section 3.122, the clause has no subject and hence supaya/
agar can be replaced by untuk (see 3.113):
 Saya dapat mengusulkan kepada pimpinan untuk/supaya 
menerima saudara.
I can suggest to the leaders to accept you.
 Hasan Basrie mendesak pemerintah untuk memperkuat 
sensor terhadap ﬁ lm kekerasan.
 Hasan Basrie urged the government to toughen censorship 
against violent movies.
If a subject occurs, supaya cannot be replaced by untuk:
 Saya dapat mengusulkan kepada pimpinan supaya mereka 
menerima saudara.
I can suggest to the leaders that they accept you.
Nominalised clauses
The word ‘nominalised’ means ‘turned/made into a noun’. 
Nominalisation can apply not only to clauses but to various 
3.127
3.128
3.129
3.130

Derived clauses 309
words, including adjectives (see 2.35). Relative clauses (see 3.97) 
can be nominalised by deletion of the head of the noun phrase, 
as discussed in section 3.131. 
A clause can also be nominalised by use of -nya on the predi-
cate; this is called predicate nominalisation, which is discussed 
in section 3.136. Some clauses can be nominalised by occur-
ring in certain positions within another clause; these are simple 
nominal clauses, discussed in section 3.143. Indirect questions 
are also nominalised constructions; these are discussed in 
section 4.27.
Nominalised relative clauses
Relative clauses occur within noun phrases and are preceded by 
yang (see 3.97).
Nominalisation occurs when the head noun is ellipted (see 
4.111), usually because it is clear from context, leaving yang at the 
beginning of the noun phrase. The yang phrase then functions 
like a noun. In corresponding constructions in English the noun 
is frequently replaced by ‘one’. The noun mobil ‘car’ in the ﬁ rst 
clause below is omitted in the second clause because it is clear 
from the context what sort of thing is being spoken about:
 Mobil yang dibeli Ali berwarna biru. Yang dibeli Hasan 
berwarna merah.
 The car which Ali bought is blue. The one Hasan bought is red.
Any deﬁ ning relative clause (see 3.98) can be nominalised by 
deletion of the head noun. The following examples illustrate a 
number of different types of nominalised relative clauses:
yang itu
that one
yang mengajukan permohonan ini
the one who presented this request
yang kedua
the second one
yang lain
the other; others
Yang biru milik saya.
The blue one is mine.
3.131
3.132

310 Clauses
Yang sudah dipakai tidak bisa dikembalikan.
The used ones can’t be returned.
Kepada yang lapar diberikan makanan.
To the hungry will be given food.
Possessor topic-comment relative clauses (see 3.104) and preposi-
tional relative clauses (see 3.106) can also be nominalised:
Yang mobilnya dicuri langsung memberitahu polisi.
The one whose car was stolen told the police straightaway.
 Yang di depannya tumbuh pohon mangga adalah rumah 
Hendrik.
 The one in front of which grows a mango tree is Hendrik’s 
house.
Object topic-comment clauses (see 3.105) are unlikely to be 
nominalised because of their complex structure.
A nominalised relative clause can occur in any of the positions 
in which the embedding phrase can occur, including subject, 
predicate and object, as in the following examples:
Yang itu teman saya.
That one is my friend.
Mobil saya yang biru.
My car is the blue one.
Andi memilih yang besar.
Andi chose the big one.
Since the nominalised clause is a noun, it is negated by bukan if 
it appears in the predicate:
Mobil saya bukan yang biru.
My car isn’t the blue one.
However, the predicate within the nominalised clause can also 
be negated and if this is a verb it is negated by tidak in the usual 
way:
Mobil saya adalah yang tidak biru.
My car is the one which isn’t blue.
3.133
3.134

Derived clauses 311
It is stated in section 3.99 that the verb in a relative clause must 
be passive if the head noun stands as object to it. This rule holds 
in a nominalised relative clause, even though the head noun is 
deleted:
Yang dibangun Pak Dani tidak begitu besar.
The one Mr Dani built isn’t very big.
Predicate nominalisation
A predicate which contains a verb or an adjective can be nomi-
nalised by the sufﬁ xation of -nya. The subject of the clause 
becomes a possessor in the nominalised construction.
The process is illustrated with the following clause:
Beberapa jalan ditutup.
Several roads were closed.
(i)  The verb is placed before the subject and -nya is attached 
to it; the subject now acts as possessor to the nomi-
nalised verb:
 
ditutupnya beberapa jalan
 
the closure of several roads
(ii)  The whole construction is now a noun phrase, which 
can occur in a larger construction, italicised in the 
following example:
 
 Lalu lintas menjadi macet karena ditutupnya beberapa 
jalan.
 
 Trafﬁ c became jammed because of the closure of several 
roads.
A second illustrative example is the following:
 Yang amat menyolok adalah hadirnya anak-anak kecil di 
setiap tempat yang kita lalui.
 What was very conspicuous was the presence of small 
children in every place we passed through.
The nominalised clause in the above is hadirnya anak-anak 
kecil ‘the presence of small children’, which derives from the 
clause anak-anak kecil hadir ‘small children are present’.
3.135
3.136

312 Clauses
The nominalised predicate can be an adjective, as in the ﬁ rst 
two examples below, an intransitive verb, as in the third to ﬁ fth 
examples, or a transitive verb. If transitive it must be passive, 
as in the last two examples below. The basic clause from which 
the nominalised clause derives is placed in brackets after each 
example below:
 Hal ini disebabkan karena miskinnya orang tua. [Orang 
tua miskin.]
This is caused by the poverty of parents.
 Mereka harus menghadapi ganasnya laut selama 
berminggu-minggu. [Laut ganas.]
They had to face the fury of the sea for weeks.
 Mereka prihatin atas terjadinya kerusuhan di kampus. 
[Kerusuhan terjadi di kampus.]
 They are concerned about the occurrence of riots on the 
campus.
 Runtuhnya komunisme Soviet merugikan ekonomi Kuba. 
[Komunisme Soviet runtuh.]
 The collapse of Soviet communism damaged the Cuban 
economy.
 Sungguh luar biasa meningkatnya jumlah anak-anak 
di negeri kita ini. [Jumlah anak-anak di negeri kita ini 
meningkat.]
 The increase in the number of children in this land of ours 
is truly extraordinary.
 Polisi telah menahan dua orang pria sehubungan dengan 
terbunuhnya seorang anggota parlemen. [Seorang 
anggota parlemen terbunuh.]
 Police have detained two males in connection with the 
killing of a member of parliament.
 Para demonstran menuntut dibebaskannya semua buruh 
yang ditahan. [Semua buruh yang ditahan dibebaskan.]
 The demonstrators demanded the freeing of all the 
detained workers.
In the examples in section 3.136 the nominalised predicate is 
a single word. However, the predicate can contain any of the 
constituents discussed in sections 2.133–53:
3.137

Derived clauses 313
Ini menunjukkan tidak adanya eﬁ siensi kerja.
This indicates lack (non-existence) of work efﬁ ciency.
 Sebuah suara yang menggeletar mengumumkan akan 
datangnya seorang jenderal yang kelak menguasai dunia.
 A shimmering voice announced the future coming of a 
general who would rule the world.
 Mereka tidak sadar tentang bakal adanya pemilihan 
umum.
They aren’t aware of the forthcoming general elections.
If the nominalised predicate is adjectival, it can include modify-
ing adverbs occurring within the adjective phrase (see 2.100):
Ini menunjukkan makin baiknya hubungan bilateral.
 This indicates the increasing improvement in bilateral 
relations.
Nominalised adjectives and verbs can often be replaced by 
nouns with afﬁ xation ke-…-an (see 1.72) or peN-…-an (see 
1.87). The following are drawn from examples in section 3.136 
with corresponding nouns in parentheses:
miskinnya (kemiskinan) orang tua
the poverty of the parents
hadirnya (kehadiran) anak-anak kecil
the presence of small children
meningkatnya (peningkatan) jumlah anak-anak
the increase in the number of children
terbunuhnya (pembunuhan) seorang anggota parlemen
the killing of a member of parliament
Where there are both intransitive and transitive verbs with the 
same base, a corresponding peN-…-an noun does not distinguish 
between them (see 1.89); however, the nominalised predicate does: 
mendaratnya/pendaratan pasukan itu ‘the landing of those troops’ 
(from: Pasukan itu mendarat ‘Those troops landed’) and didarat-
kannya/pendaratan pasukan itu ‘the landing of those troops’ 
(from: Pasukan itu didaratkan ‘Those troops were landed’).
Not all nominalised verbs and adjectives can be replaced 
by ke-…-an or peN-…-an nouns. In particular, if the nomi-
nalisation involves other predicate components, such as tidak 
3.138

314 Clauses
adanya ‘non-existence’ and akan datangnya ‘future coming’, 
as in examples in section 3.137, this is not possible. Also, a 
few nominalised forms have different meanings from affixed 
forms with the same base. Thus banyaknya orang ‘the large 
number of people’ and kebanyakan orang ‘the majority of 
people’.
A nominalised predicate can consist of two words in contrast. 
The pair can be two adjectives, such as besar-kecilnya ‘size, 
dimensions’, two intransitive verbs, such as timbul-tenggelam-
nya ‘rise and fall’, or an adjective or intransitive verb and tidak, 
such as ada-tidaknya ‘existence or not’:
Besar-kecilnya rumah itu tidak diberitahukan.
 The size (largeness or smallness) of the house was not reported.
 Timbul-tenggelamnya suata negara tidak bergantung pada 
cara pemerintahannya.
 The rise and fall of a nation does not depend on its type of 
government.
 Pembebasan suatu negara tergantung pada ada-tidaknya 
kegiatan politik.
 The liberation of a country depends on the existence or 
otherwise of political activity.
Such constructions do not derive directly from independent 
clauses. However, many of them can be related to construc-
tions in which predicates are coordinated by atau (see 4.64), 
which is sometimes retained in the nominalised form. The 
nominalised structure in the following example derives from 
a clause with coordinated predicates, Usaha ini berhasil 
atau tidak berhasil ‘This endeavour succeeds or does not 
succeed’:
 Berhasil-tidaknya/berhasil atau tidaknya usaha ini tergan-
tung pada kita.
The success or failure of this endeavour depends on us.
Nominalisation of adjectives referring to measure is a partic-
ular type of predicate nominalisation. Adjectives of measure 
are nominalised as explained in section 3.136. Thus Orang itu 
tinggi ‘That person is tall’ yields tingginya orang itu ‘the height 
3.139
3.140

Derived clauses 315
of that person’. Such constructions frequently occur as subjects 
of quantity clauses (see 3.8):
Tingginya orang itu seratus tujuh puluh sentimeter.
 That person’s height is one hundred and seventy centimetres.
Nominalised adjectives of measure only take -nya obligatorily if 
there is no other possessor expressed. In the presence of a ﬁ rst 
or second person possessor -nya cannot occur:
Beratnya sepuluh kilo.
Its weight is ten kilos.
Berat(nya) koper ini sepuluh kilo.
The weight of this suitcase is ten kilos.
Berat saya delapan puluh kilo.
My weight is eighty kilos.
Nominalised measure adjective constructions frequently 
become topic-comment clauses (see 3.88):
Roket itu panjangnya 7,9 meter dan beratnya kg.
 The length of the rocket is 7.9 metres and its weight is 2,180 kg.
A nominalised adjective of measure cannot be used if the 
construction does not contain a possessor. Instead, a ke-…-an 
noun (see 1.72) is used:
 Roket itu mampu mencapai ketinggian 50 mil dan 
mencapai kecepatan mil per jam.
 The rocket can achieve a height of 50 miles and a speed of 
2,500 miles per hour.
A ke-…-an noun is sometimes used instead of a nominalised 
measure adjective even where there is a possessor (see also 
3.138). The nouns kedalaman ‘depth’ and kecepatan ‘speed’ 
frequently occur in such contexts:
Kedalaman/dalamnya sungai ini tiga meter.
The depth of this river is three metres.
Kecepatan/cepatnya mobil itu seratus kilometer per jam.
 The speed of the car was one hundred kilometres per 
hour.
3.141
3.142

316 Clauses
However, the two forms sometimes differ. Thus ketinggian 
‘height’ refers to how far above the ground something is: keting-
gian pesawat itu ‘the height of that plane (i.e. how high it is 
ﬂ ying)’, while tingginya ‘height, tallness’ refers to the measure-
ment of something from its base to top.
Simple nominal clauses
Intransitive verbs and transitive active verbs can be used as nouns 
meaning ‘the general activity denoted by the verb’. In grammars of 
English these are usually called gerunds, verbal nouns or nominal 
‘-ing’ clauses. They can occur as subject of a clause:
Berenang sangat baik untuk kesehatan.
Swimming is very good for the health.
Mengarang ialah seni.
Writing is an art.
While a verb is often nominalised alone, as in the above examples, 
other clause elements can occur with it. However, because the 
nominalised verb refers to activity in a general way it cannot 
have a subject:
Mengumpulkan perangko adalah kesukaannya.
Collecting stamps is his hobby.
Membersihkan rumah tidak boleh dilalaikan.
Cleaning the house cannot be neglected.
Menangkap pencuri itu tidak begitu mudah.
Catching that thief is not going to be so easy.
Besides components of the original clause, nothing can occur 
within the noun phrase with a nominal clause except the demon-
strative itu, which occurs when the statement is generic; that is, 
all possible instances of the action are referred to. Use of itu also 
has the effect of identifying the verb as nominal (see 2.7):
Lari itu sehat.
Running is healthy.
As mentioned in section 3.115 deletion of untuk results in a 
simple nominal clause, although not all simple nominal clauses 
can become untuk clauses.
3.143

Derived clauses 317
In all the examples in section 3.143, simple nominal clauses 
occur in subject position. A simple nominal clause can also 
occur as predicate, in which case it is usually preceded by copula 
adalah or ialah (see also the ﬁ rst example in 3.6):
Tugas saya adalah menjual koran.
My task is selling newspapers.
Kesenangan kami ialah bermain sepak bola.
Our favourite pastime is playing soccer.
That the verb is here acting as a noun is shown by the fact that 
the predicate is equated with the subject and is negated by 
bukan. When the predicate is negated, a copula rarely occurs:
Kegemaran saya bukan memelihara binatang.
My hobby is not looking after animals.
Secondary verbs of the type jahit-menjahit ‘everything to do 
with sewing’ are always nominalised; these are discussed in 
section 1.252.

4 SENTENCES
A sentence is a construction which is grammatically complete; 
it can stand alone as a complete utterance (although it may be 
closely linked to what has gone before). A sentence expresses 
a statement, question, command or exclamation. In writing a 
sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop, 
question mark or exclamation mark.
In this chapter the different types of sentence structure are 
described. The four moods—statements, questions, impera-
tives, exclamations—are described in sections 4.2–62.
Sentences are either simple or complex. A simple sentence 
consists of a single independent clause (clauses are described 
in Chapter 3). A complex sentence is one which consists of 
more than a single clause. Complex sentences are described in 
sections 4.63–110.
Ellipsis, or omission of clause components, is discussed in 
sections 4.111–18.
MOOD
Sentences can be classiﬁ ed according to the basic reason for 
their utterance. This is usually called mood or mode. The four 
moods recognised here are statements, questions, imperatives 
and exclamations.
4.1
4.2

Mood 319
Statements
Statements are used when we give information, express an 
opinion and so on. Statements are sometimes said to be in the 
declarative mood. Chapters 1–3 deal almost exclusively with 
statements.
Questions
Questions are sometimes said to be in the interrogative mood. 
There are two types of question: yes–no questions, dealt with 
in sections 4.5–13, and information questions, described in 
sections 4.14–22. In both types -kah can occur to mark the 
construction as a question. This is discussed in sections 4.23–6. 
Questions can be placed within statements. These are called 
indirect questions, discussed in sections 4.27–31.
Yes–no questions
Questions which seek the answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ are yes–no ques-
tions:
Kamu lapar? Are you hungry?
Tidak. No.
(The answer might not be a simple positive or negative; there 
are many other responses, such as kadang-kadang ‘sometimes’, 
mungkin ‘possibly’ and so on.)
Yes–no questions are spoken with interrogative intonation, 
marked by a rise in ﬁ nal pitch, and written with a ﬁ nal question 
mark. Frequently intonation (a question mark in writing) is the 
only difference between a statement, marked by a fall in ﬁ nal 
pitch, and a yes–no question:
Sri sudah pulang.
Sri has gone home.
Sri sudah pulang?
Has Sri gone home?
Dia guru.
He is a teacher.
Dia guru?
Is he a teacher?
4.3
4.4
4.5

320 Sentences
A yes–no question does not usually have a different word order 
from the corresponding statement. However, if boleh occurs it 
usually precedes the subject:
Boleh saya masuk?
May I come in?
A yes–no question can be made overtly interrogative by placing 
apa or apakah before it. This is more common in writing and 
formal speech:
Apa ini hari Selasa?
Is this Tuesday?
Apakah dia guru?
Is she a teacher?
In this context apa(kah), which is here called a question marker, 
has no lexical function but simply signals that what follows is a 
question. It must be distinguished from the question word apa 
‘what?’ (see 4.15):
Apa dia sudah makan?
Has she eaten?
Dia sudah makan apa?
What has she eaten?
The ﬁ rst sentence above contains the question marker apa, 
which can be omitted:
Dia sudah makan?
Has she eaten?
In the second sentence apa ‘what’ is the object of the verb and 
cannot be omitted.
If question marker apa does not occur -kah can be attached to 
another word to signal that the construction is a question, that 
word usually being placed ﬁ rst in the clause:
Sudahkah dia makan? Has she eaten?
Use of -kah is discussed in sections 4.23–6.
4.6
4.7
4.8

Mood 321
Bukan as sentence tag
Bukan can be attached to a statement to turn it into a question. 
Bukan then corresponds to a sentence tag with ‘be’, ‘have’ or 
‘do’ in English. This is usually used either when the speaker, 
uncertain as to the truth of the statement, seeks conﬁ rm ation 
or, when knowing the statement to be correct, seeks agreement 
from the addressee:
Saudara mahasiswa, bukan?
You are a student, aren’t you?
Pesawat berangkat jam lima, bukan?
The plane leaves at ﬁ ve, doesn’t it?
Dia sudah makan, bukan?
She has eaten, hasn’t she?
As the above examples show, bukan is used in this way even if the 
construction would usually be negated with tidak or belum.
Bukan can occur as tag to a negative sentence:
Saudara tidak punya surat jalan, bukan?
You don’t have a travel document, do you?
Bukan occurs ﬁ rst in the sentence if -kah is attached to it (see 4.25).
Informally bukan may be replaced by kan, but only when the 
speaker is seeking agreement from the addressee to a situation 
the speaker knows to be correct. Kan often comes before the 
predicate, rather than at the end of the sentence:
Gajinya lumayan, kan?
Gajinya kan lumayan?
The salary is pretty good, isn’t it?
Ya as sentence tag
In informal speech ya can occur as a sentence tag. Like bukan 
it turns a statement into a question, which invites conﬁ rm ation 
or agreement from the listener. This also allows the speaker to 
avoid the impression of making a ﬁ rm assertion:
Dia cantik, ya?
She’s pretty, isn’t she?
Film itu bagus, ya?
That movie was great, eh?
Ya also occurs in imperatives (see 4.42).
4.9
4.10
4.11

322 Sentences
Alternative possibility yes–no questions
The alternative possibility can be indicated by attaching atau 
plus a negative, meaning ‘or not’, to a yes–no question. The 
negative following atau is the same as would occur if the preced-
ing part of the question were negated:
Apakah anda mau ikut, atau tidak?
Do you want to come, or not?
Ini jalan ke Rawamangun, atau bukan?
Is this the road to Rawamangun, or not?
Mereka sudah pulang, atau belum?
Have they gone home yet, or not?
In less formal contexts atau may be deleted:
Mereka sudah pulang, belum?
Have they gone home yet, or not?
Responses to yes–no questions
A yes–no question can be answered by a positive response, such as 
ya ‘yes’, betul ‘correct’. This may be followed by a full sentence:
Q: Siti cantik?
Is Siti pretty?
A: Ya, (dia cantik).
Yes, (she is).
Frequently a positive response is with a word which occurred 
in the question. The most common of such words are sudah, 
boleh, mau:
Q: Anda sudah makan?
Have you eaten?
A: Sudah.
Yes. (literally: ‘Already.’)
Q: Boleh saya masuk?
May I come in?
A: Boleh.
Yes. (literally: ‘(You) may.’)
Responses are further discussed in section 4.118.
4.12
4.13

Mood 323
A negative response to a positive question is with the appropri-
ate negative word:
Q: Anda sudah makan?
Have you eaten yet?
A: Belum.
Not yet.
If a yes–no question contains a negative it is agreed to by a 
positive response, such as ya ‘yes’, betul ‘correct’, where ‘no’ 
would occur in English. In a full response this is then followed 
by a sentence containing a negative:
Q: Anda tidak minum kopi?
You don’t drink coffee?
A: Ya, (saya tidak minum kopi).
No, (I don’t drink coffee).
Q: Kamu belum mengisi formulir, bukan?
You haven’t ﬁ lled in the form yet, have you?
A: Ya, (saya belum mengisi formulir).
No, (I haven’t ﬁ lled the form in yet).
Although a tag question is always formed with bukan, a negative 
response uses the appropriate negative word, bukan if the pred-
icate is a noun, belum if the predicate contains sudah and tidak 
elsewhere:
Q: Anda lapar, bukan?
You’re hungry, aren’t you?
A: Tidak.
No.
Information questions
These questions do not seek ‘yes’ or ‘no’ as an answer but require 
speciﬁ c information. Information questions contain a question 
word, or interrogative, corresponding to one of the ‘wh-’ words 
in English. These are:
apa what
siapa who
(di/ke/dari) mana where (at/to/from)
(yang) mana which
kapan, bila when
4.14

324 Sentences
apabila, bila(mana) when
bagaimana how
berapa how many, how much
keberapa which number
mengapa, kenapa why
untuk apa why, what for
Information questions usually have the same word order as 
corresponding statements. In the sentences below apa and siapa 
are objects. Both occur after the verb, in the normal position for 
an object in a statement. In English the question word must be 
placed ﬁ rst in the sentence:
Anda membaca apa?
What are you reading?
Dia menemui siapa?
Who did he meet?
However, if the question word is predicate of a non-verbal 
clause it often precedes the subject (see also examples at the end 
of 4.16):
Siapa dia?
Who is he?
Bagaimana jalan itu?
What is that road like?
Siapa and apa
These are interrogative pronouns, occurring in the same posi-
tions as nouns. They can thus occur as components of a clause, 
as in the ﬁ rst two examples in section 4.14.
They can also occur within a noun phrase. Modifying a noun 
apa asks ‘what’:
Buku/hari/ﬁ lm apa ini?
What book/day/movie is this?
As a question word apa must be distinguished from the question 
marker discussed in section 4.7.
Following a noun siapa is possessive, meaning ‘whose’:
Anak siapa ini?
Whose child is this?
4.15

Mood 325
Siapa is an independent phrase if it does not follow a noun. 
In the following example it is the predicate of an interrogative 
clause and can be contrasted with the sentence above:
Siapa anak ini?
Who is this child?
To ask about the name of a person, siapa is used:
Siapa nama orang itu?
What is that person’s name?
For anything other than a person, apa is used:
Apa nama kota itu?
What is the name of that town?
Apa and siapa can follow prepositions. In English a prepo-
sition can precede ‘who’ and ‘what’ at the beginning of a clause, 
although this only occurs in formal style; usually the prepo sition 
is placed at the end of the sentence. In Indonesian siapa and apa 
cannot be separated from a preceding preposition:
Ibu memberi buku itu kepada siapa?
Who did mother give the book to?
Anda membeli buku ini untuk siapa?
Who did you buy this book for?
Dia menulis dengan apa?
What did he write with?
The preposition plus question word can occur ﬁ rst for emphasis; 
here also they cannot be separated:
Dengan siapa dia menonton?
Who did she go to the pictures with?
Apa and siapa cannot occur as subject of a passive clause. 
Instead, the construction is changed to an identifying clause 
(see 3.92), with the question word as predicate. The question 
word is then followed by yang, which introduces the subject:
Apa yang dibicarakan di rapat?
What was discussed at the meeting?
Siapa yang kauundang?
 Who did you invite? (literally: ‘Who was the one you invited?’)
4.16

326 Sentences
Further, the subject of a passive clause cannot be a noun phrase 
containing siapa or apa, the same change being required here 
also:
Film apa yang kamu tonton?
What movie did you see?
Sepeda siapa yang dicuri?
Whose bike was stolen?
Although some Indonesians allow the interrogatives to be 
subject of an active verb, many people always use an identifying 
construction here also:1
Siapa yang menulis buku ini?
Who wrote this book?
Apa yang dapat menyebabkan sakit perut?
What can cause stomach ache?
Non-verbal clauses are also transformed into identifying 
constructions:
Siapa yang marah?
Who is angry?
Apa yang enak?
What is delicious?
Questions corresponding to noun phrase clauses do not use 
the identifying yang constructions. The interrogative predicate 
freely occurs before or after the subject:
Apa ini?/Ini apa?
What is this?
Siapa orang itu?/Orang itu siapa?
Who is that person?
When yang does occur in noun phrase clause questions, it has a 
contrastive function:
Yang ini apa? What is this one?
Mana
Following a locative preposition (see 2.119) mana means ‘which’. 
Like siapa and apa (see 4.15), mana cannot be separated from 
the preposition, although ‘where’ usually is in English:
4.17

Mood 327
Mereka datang dari mana?
Where do they come from?
Ke mana mereka membawa barang itu?
Where are they taking those things?
Occurring within a noun phrase mana usually follows yang and 
asks ‘which (out of a known set)’:
Tomo tinggal di rumah yang mana?
Which house does Tomo live in?
Yang before mana is usually omitted if the following phrase 
begins with yang, although it can be retained:
Pohon mana yang akan ditebang?
Which tree will be cut down?
Pasif yang mana yang harus dipakai dalam kalimat ini?
Which passive must be used in this sentence?
As illustrated in the above examples, a noun phrase containing 
(yang) mana cannot be the subject of a passive clause; instead 
an identifying clause (see 3.92) is used, as also occurs if apa or 
siapa occurs within the noun phrase (see 4.16).
The phrase orang mana asks about a person’s origins:
Penyanyi itu orang mana?
 Where does that singer come from/What country is that 
singer from?
The phrase yang mana can be nominalised (see 3.131):
Yang mana mobilmu?
Which is your car?
Berapa
Berapa precedes a noun as an indeﬁ nite number meaning 
‘how many’: berapa jam/tahun/orang ‘how many hours/years/
people’. It follows a noun to ask ‘which, what’ if the answer is a 
number; that is, if the noun refers to something belonging to a 
series in which the members are distinguished by a number (see 
2.15): jam/tahun/kelas/tingkat/halaman berapa ‘what hour 
(time)/year/class/level/page’. The difference is illustrated by the 
following examples:
4.18
4.19

328 Sentences
Berapa jam mereka tunggu di sini?
How many hours (how long) did they wait here?
Jam berapa mereka singgah di sini?
What time did they call by here?
Kamu sudah membaca berapa halaman?
How many pages have you read?
Kamu membaca halaman berapa?
What page did you read?
Keberapa
Keberapa ‘which number’ asks the number in a sequence of 
something which is not usually distinguished by its relative 
order. The position of such a noun in a series is identiﬁ ed by an 
ordinal number (see 2.16). Keberapa is thus the interrogative 
ordinal:
Fatimah istrinya yang keberapa?
What number wife of his is Fatimah?
Other question words
Question words of time, reason and manner usually occur ﬁ rst 
in the clause:
Kapan/bila dia akan berangkat ke Jakarta?
When will he leave for Jakarta?
Mengapa mereka belum menjawab surat saya?
Why haven’t they replied to my letter yet?
Bagaimana kotak ini harus dibuka?
How should this box be opened?
Question word plus saja
Combinations of a question word followed by saja when occur-
ring in questions indicate an expectation on the part of the 
person asking the question that the answer will contain refer-
ence to more than one thing:
Andi akan berkunjung ke mana saja?
Which places will Andi visit?
When asking this, the questioner assumes not only that Andi 
will go visiting but also that he will go to more than one place. 
A typical answer might thus refer to a number of places:
4.20
4.21
4.22

Mood 329
Dia akan berkunjung ke Aceh, Medan dan Palembang.
He will visit Aceh, Medan and Palembang.
The following examples illustrate the other common phrases in 
this group:
Apa saja yang dibeli ibu di pasar?
What things did mother buy at the market?
Pertunjukan apa saja yang dapat ditonton di sana?
What shows can be seen there?
Anda ingin bertemu dengan siapa saja?
Which people do you wish to meet?
Anda membaca surat kabar yang mana saja?
Which newspapers do you read?
Mahasiswa itu berasal dari mana saja?
Which places do those students come from?
Questions with -kah
A sentence can be overtly marked as a question by use of -kah. It 
is always optional and is largely conﬁ ned to writing and formal 
speech. The element to which -kah is attached is placed ﬁ rst 
in the question. The question particle -kah can occur in both 
yes–no and information questions.
-kah in yes–no questions
If apa is present, -kah attaches to it:
Apakah dia sakit?
Is he sick?
If apa does not occur, -kah attaches to another word within the 
clause. This is usually the predicate centre:
Sakitkah dia?
Is he sick?
Jatuhkah dia?
Did she fall?
If the predicate centre is a phrase—for instance, an adjective or 
locative phrase—or if the predicate phrase contains a time marker, 
modal or negative, -kah can attach to the ﬁ nal word of the phrase, 
the whole phrase then occurring at the beginning of the question:
4.23
4.24

330 Sentences
Terlalu gemukkah anda?
Are you too fat?
Sudah pergikah ia?
Has she gone?
If a complement occurs, this remains in its normal position:
Maukah kamu ikut?
Do you want to come along?
Tahukah anda mengapa mereka bekerja di sini?
Do you know why they are working here?
Instead of being attached to the predicate centre, -kah can be 
attached to a time marker, negative or modal to highlight that 
this is what is being asked about. If marked by -kah, this word 
then goes to the beginning of the clause while the rest of the 
predicate remains in its usual place. Some other clause comp-
onents, including a number of adjuncts, can also be marked in 
this way:
Sudahkah hal itu kaupikirkan?
Have you already thought about that matter?
Akankah pertemuannya dengan Presiden Soeharto batal?
Will his meeting with President Soeharto be cancelled?
Seringkah dia pergi ke sana?
Does she often go there?
The sentence tag bukan (see 4.9) can take -kah; it then goes to 
the beginning of the sentence and carries a tone of ‘Isn’t it the 
case that …?’:
Bukankah dia berasal dari golongan menengah?
Isn’t it the case that he comes from the middle class?
Bukankah saudara kaya?
Aren’t you rich? (Isn’t it the case that you are rich?)
If bukankah occurs in a noun clause, it can alternatively be 
interpreted as a case of -kah being attached to the negative 
within the predicate and not to a tag. This is the only interpre-
tation if the negative is other than bukan:
Tidakkah ini memberikan dampak yang negatif?
Doesn’t this give a negative impact?
4.25

Mood 331
Information questions with -kah
In information questions -kah attaches to the question word, 
which comes ﬁ rst in the clause:
Siapakah dia?
Who is he?
 Bagaimanakah perahu nelayan itu dapat menemukan 
jalan?
How can the ﬁ shermen’s boats ﬁ nd their way?
Apakah yang dia kerjakan?
What is he doing?
If the question word is part of a phrase the whole phrase occurs 
ﬁ rst, with -kah attached to the last word of the phrase:
Pukul berapakah pesawat berangkat?
What time does the plane depart?
Berapa jauhkah kota kelahiranmu dari sini?
How far is your birthplace from here?
If siapa ‘who’ and apa ‘what’ occur as object of an active verb 
they must come after the verb, in which case -kah cannot occur. 
However, the question word can occur ﬁ rst in an identifying 
clause (see 3.92)—which must be passive—and take -kah:
Anda menemui siapa?
Who did you meet?
Siapakah yang anda temui?
 Who did you meet? (literally: ‘Who was the one that was met 
by you?’)
Indirect questions
A question can be placed within a statement, taking the 
place of a noun. Thus the question Kapan dia akan pindah? 
‘When will he move?’ can occur as the complement of tahu 
‘know’:
Saya tidak tahu kapan dia akan pindah.
I don’t know when he will move.
As it takes the place of a noun, an indirect question is a kind 
of nominalised clause (see 3.130). Turning a free question 
into an indirect question involves no change in word order in 
4.26

Indonesian. However, interrogative intonation does not occur 
and a question mark is not used in writing.
Indirect information questions can occur as object or comple-
ment of a verb:
Saya tidak tahu mengapa rapat itu dibatalkan.
I don’t know why the meeting was cancelled.
Saya lupa di mana saya menyimpan surat itu.
I forget where I put the letter.
Kami mengerti bagaimana perasaannya.
 We understand his feelings. (literally: ‘…what his feelings 
are like’)
Dia memberitahukan apa yang dilihatnya.
He told what he saw.
The indirect question can be the subject in a passive clause; it 
usually follows the verb:
Belum diketahui siapa yang akan menjadi dekan.
It isn’t known yet who will become the dean.
An indirect yes–no question must be preceded by apa(kah), 
translated ‘if, whether’; as the question loses its interrogative 
intonation there is no other signal that it is a question. Like 
indirect information questions these can occur as object or 
complement or as subject in a passive clause:
Kami ragu-ragu apa dia bisa lulus ujian.
We are doubtful whether he can pass the exam.
Saya tidak tahu apakah bis ini berhenti di Pasar Senen.
I don’t know if this bus stops at Pasar Senen.
Masih diragukan apakah pendapat ini dapat diterima.
It is still doubtful whether this opinion can be accepted.
Yes–no questions ending with atau plus a negative (see 4.12) can 
also become indirect questions:
Dia bertanya apa mereka setuju atau tidak.
He asked if they agreed or not.
Saya tidak tahu apakah ini Pak Amran atau bukan.
I don’t know if this is Mr Amran or not.

Imperatives
Constructions in imperative mood are all addressed to someone 
with the intention that something is done. They range from 
strong commands to requests, appeals and suggestions. Basic 
imperatives are discussed in sections 4.33–40. Milder construc-
tions, including requests and invitations, are discussed in 
sections 4.41–56.
Basic imperatives are usually written with a ﬁ nal excla mation 
mark, although this convention is not always observed, espe-
cially if the order is a mild one.
Intransitive verbs in imperatives
Intransitive verbs undergo no change in imperatives:
Datang ke sini!
Come here!
Berangkat sekarang!
Leave now!
Menginap di sini!
Stay here!
Transitive verbs in imperatives
Transitive verbs drop preﬁ x meN- if they refer to action 
performed on a speciﬁ c object:
Lihat foto ini!
Look at this photo!
Tutup pintu!
Shut the door!
A transitive verb in an imperative construction does not lose 
its preﬁ x if it occurs without an object, that is, if acting pseudo-
intransitively (see 3.21):
Membaca sekarang!
Read now!
Menulis baik-baik!
Write properly!
Preﬁ x meN- is also retained if an object occurs but does not 
refer to something speciﬁ c:
4.32
4.33
4.34

334 Sentences
Menabung uang untuk hari tuamu!
Save money for your old age!
Membaca buku sekarang!
Read a book now!
Such constructions refer to action in general, not to a particular 
action performed on a speciﬁ c object. Interest is thus on the 
activity alone and the ‘object’ can be regarded as forming a kind 
of compound with the verb. Thus, in the last example above 
membaca buku acts like an intransitive verb ‘do book reading’.
Negative imperatives
Negative commands are formed with jangan ‘don’t’:
Jangan merokok di sini!
Don’t smoke here!
Jangan tidur!
Don’t go to sleep!
In the presence of jangan preﬁ x meN- on transitive verbs is 
regarded by most people as optional, even if there is a speciﬁ c 
object:
Jangan (mem)baca buku itu sekarang!
Don’t read that book now!
Jangan mencuci sekarang! (Kita harus pergi nanti.)
 Don’t wash now/Don’t do any washing now! (We have to go 
soon.)
Jangan is emphasised by sekali-kali:
Jangan sekali-kali melanggar peraturan ini!
Never disobey this rule!
Constructions with jangan kita ‘let’s not’ are mentioned in 
section 4.54.
Passive imperatives
An imperative with a transitive verb can be expressed in the 
passive, with preﬁ x di. As such a verb cannot occur in a state-
ment with a second person agent (see 3.27), this construction 
contains a suggestion of being directed not at the addressee 
4.35
4.36

Mood 335
but at a third person. It is thus more indirect and consequently 
less forceful than an imperative with an active verb, contain-
ing a sense of ‘it is to be done’ rather than ‘you do it’, although 
this is not always reﬂ ected in the translations of the following 
examples:
Barang itu ditaruh di sini saja!
Just put those things here!
Diangkat, jangan diseret!
Lift it, don’t drag it!
In a negative construction the subject can either precede jangan 
or follow the predicate:
Jendela ini jangan dibuka!
Jangan dibuka jendela ini!
This window is not to be opened!
In passive imperatives the subject (i.e. the patient of the verb) is 
always deﬁ nite (see 3.39).
Prohibitions are expressed as passives; for instance, with dilarang 
‘(it is) forbidden’. While these are structurally statements, their 
intention is imperative:
Dilarang masuk.
No entry.
Dilarang menyalakan api.
Lighting ﬁ res is prohibited.
Addressee in imperatives
Although the addressee is not usually mentioned in im peratives, 
it can be. In Classical Malay it was expressed in an agent phrase, 
olehmu ‘by you’:
Tangkaplah olehmu Sang Tomo, hai Bima!
Seize Tomo, O Bima!
This form occurs today only in literary and archaic usage:
Pujilah olehmu Allah yang maharahim!
Praise God the most merciful!
‘Bacalah olehmu sendiri ini, Jan,’ kataku pada Dapperste.
‘Read this yourself, Jan,’ I said to Dapperste.2
4.37
4.38

336 Sentences
With jangan the addressee can be expressed by a pronoun 
placed before the verb:
Jangan kamu (mem)baca surat ini!
Don’t you read this letter!
Pronoun objects
Bound pronouns (see 2.71) cannot occur as objects of verbs in 
imperative constructions; instead, full pronouns must occur:
Jangan mengganggu aku/dia!
Don’t disturb me/him!
While -nya can occur as object in a statement, corresponding to 
unstressed ‘it’ in English as in the ﬁ rst sentence below, it cannot 
occur in an imperative. Instead, the object is not mentioned if it 
is clear from context or, if necessary, is mentioned in full:
Saya sudah membacanya.
I’ve read it.
Ini suratnya. Baca!
This is his letter. Read it!
Particle -lah in imperatives
In writing and formal speech -lah is optionally added to the verb 
in imperative constructions. This can also occur in informal 
styles but is much less frequent:
Bukalah pintu itu!
Open that door!
Berangkatlah sekarang!
Depart now!
It is frequently stated in teaching texts that -lah makes an 
im perative polite. Some writers even translate it as ‘please’. 
Further, it is used so frequently in some works as to give the 
impression it is more or less obligatory and some even refer to it 
as an ‘imperative particle’. However, it is probably the case that 
for most Indonesians -lah does not function as a softener and 
rarely occurs in imperative constructions in everyday speech. 
Moreover, some people even regard an imperative with -lah as 
being stronger rather than softer.3
4.39

Mood 337
Softeners in imperatives
A number of words can be used in imperatives to make them 
softer or to produce polite requests. These are discussed in 
sections 4.42–7.
Tag ya
In section 4.11 it is noted that as a sentence tag in informal state-
ments ya allows the speaker to avoid the impression of making 
a ﬁ rm assertion. In imperatives it has the same function. By 
drawing the listener into agreement it avoids the impression of 
a ﬁ rm order:
Jendela ditutup, ya, sebelum tidur.
Shut the window, won’t you, before you go to bed.4
Silakan ‘please’
Silakan (or silahkan), translated ‘please’, invites the addressee 
to do something for his or her own beneﬁ t. Preﬁ x meN- drops 
with transitive verbs:
Silakan masuk.
Please come in.
Silakan ambil kue.
Please take some cake.
Tolong, coba, harap in imperatives
These three words occur with imperatives to make them polite, 
preceding what would otherwise be a ﬁ rmer order. Preﬁ x meN- 
drops if there is a speciﬁ c object (see 4.34). A transitive verb can 
be passive, in which case the subject can occur before or after 
the verb. These words are not used if the addressee is invited to 
do something for his or her own beneﬁ t, when silakan is appro-
priate (see 4.43).
Tolong
Translated ‘please’, tolong requests the addressee to do some-
thing for the speaker’s beneﬁ t (cf. menolong ‘help’). It is 
frequently used by one with less authority to one with more 
authority or seniority, or to someone of the same status who is 
not well known to the speaker:
4.41
4.42
4.43
4.44
4.45

338 Sentences
Tolong ambilkan saya jas itu.
Please fetch me that jacket.
Tolong dicuci pakaian ini.
Please have these clothes washed.
Tolong ke atas.
Please go upstairs.
Tolong pergi ke toko depan.
Please go to the shop across the road.
Coba
Also translatable ‘please’, coba frequently has a suggestion of 
urging (cf. mencoba ‘try’). It differs from tolong in that it is 
not usually used in a request for the speaker’s own beneﬁ t. 
Unlike tolong, it can occur with intransitive verbs. It is almost 
always used by seniors to juniors or between people of equal 
status:
Coba duduk baik-baik, Andi.
Please sit properly, Andi.
Coba anjingmu diikat, Mardi.
Please tie your dog up, Mardi.
Coba can occur with kita ‘we (inclusive)’; the addressee is then 
urged to join the speaker in the action:
Coba kita lihat siapa yang ada di sana.
Let’s see who’s there.
It can also be used with saya ‘I’, the addressee being urged to 
allow the speaker to perform the action:
Coba saya lihat PR-mu.
Let me see your homework.
Harap
This word is politer than coba and can be used to elders and 
seniors. It is somewhat softer than ‘please’, the expression ‘would 
you please’ usually being a more appropriate trans lation (cf. 
berharap ‘hope’). It may, like tolong, seek help for the speaker 
but is not restricted to this:
4.46
4.47

Mood 339
Harap telepon Tuti di rumah.
Please telephone Tuti at home.
Harap buku saya dikembalikan.
Would you please return my book.
Like coba, it can be used with intransitive and pseudo-intrans-
itive verbs, preﬁ x meN- being retained:
Harap berdiri.
Would you please stand up.
Harap menulis di sini.
Please write here.
The addressee can be mentioned:
Harap bapak tunggu sebentar.
Would you please wait a moment, sir.
Softeners occurring with jangan
Tolong, coba and harap can be placed before negative impera-
tives:
Tolong jangan antarkan Siti ke setasiun sekarang.
Please don’t take Siti to the station now.
Coba jangan diganggu anjing itu.
Please don’t annoy the dog.
Harap jangan marah.
Please don’t be angry.
Softeners occurring with -lah
If -lah (see 3.51) occurs with a softener it usually attaches to the 
softener, which is the ﬁ rst word of the clause. Alternatively, it 
can follow the verb:
Tolonglah buka jendela itu.
Tolong bukalah jendela itu.
Please open that window.
Requests
There are a number of ways of requesting someone to perform 
an action apart from adding a softener to a basic imperative. 
Sometimes the construction is essentially the same as in a basic 
4.48

340 Sentences
imperative, but this is not always so. Very polite requests are 
brieﬂ y discussed in section 4.53.
Requests with minta and mohon
The verbs (me)minta and (me)mohon both occur in state-
ments with the meaning ‘request’. Simple, direct requests with 
them are, however, in imperative mood:
Minta air.
Can I please have some water.
Minta tolong.
Would you please help me.
Mohon undangan dibawa.
Please bring your invitation.
Unlike the softeners, mohon and minta co-occur with either 
tidak or jangan to form a negative request, although some 
people accept only tidak in this context (see also 3.128):
Mohon tidak merokok.
Please don’t smoke.
Mohon jangan iri hati.
Please don’t be jealous.
Requests with hendaklah and hendaknya
The words hendaklah and hendaknya, meaning ‘please, it is 
requested, you should’, form polite requests, usually conveying 
a suggestion that the action should be performed.
Hendaknya koper-koper dikunci.
Suitcases should be locked.
Hendaklah membalas surat ini dengan segera.
Would you please reply to this letter at once.
Very polite requests
A number of words occur, either alone or in combination, to 
form very polite requests. They are followed by a full clause, 
including the second person subject. The most frequently used 
word is sudi ‘be prepared to; have the pleasure to’:
Sudi bapak duduk.
Would you please be seated, sir.
4.51
4.52
4.53

Mood 341
The word kiranya ‘(I) wonder; apparently’ can form requests 
meaning ‘kindly, please’:
Saya minta kiranya anda membalas surat ini.
I request that you kindly respond to this letter.
Several combinations with sudi and kiranya are even politer, 
such as sudilah kiranya:
Sudilah kiranya saudara membawa barang itu ke sini.
Would you be so good as to bring those things here.
The formula sudi apalah kiranya introduces a supplication:
 Sudi apalah kiranya bapak memberikan bantuan kepada 
pembawa surat ini.
 Would you please be so kind as to give assistance to the bearer 
of this letter.
Constructions with mari and ayo
Mari is used to urge the addressee to join the speaker in the 
activity, being translated ‘let us’. First person inclusive pronoun 
kita optionally occurs:
Mari kita pergi ke bioskop.
Let’s go to the movies.
Mari makan.
Let’s eat.
Particle -lah can be attached to mari:
Marilah (kita) menyanyi.
Let us sing.
Ayo has a similar meaning but is more informal. Unlike mari it 
cannot be used to older people, only to equals and juniors. It has 
a sense of ‘come on, let’s …’:
Ayo kita makan dulu.
Come on, let’s eat now.
If the verb has a speciﬁ c object, meN- is omitted (see 4.34):
Mari kita habiskan kue ini.
Let’s ﬁ nish off this cake.
4.54

342 Sentences
Ayo kita habiskan!
Come on, let’s ﬁ nish it off !
These words cannot co-occur with jangan. Thus in a construc-
tion urging the addressee to join the speaker in not doing some-
thing they are absent. However, kita must occur:
Jangan kita pergi ke sana.
Let’s not go there.
Mari can be used with a ﬁ rst person pronoun if the speaker 
wishes to do something for the beneﬁ t of the addressee. The 
verb must be transitive and have a speciﬁ c object; consequently 
meN- does not occur on the verb (see 4.34):
Mari saya bawakan tas bapak.
Let me carry your bag.
Both mari and ayo can be used to invite the addressee to do 
something, in this function being similar to silakan (see 4.43) 
although less formal:
Mari/Ayo masuk!
Come on in!
They can also be used as a very informal way of taking leave:
Mari/Ayo.
Bye, see you.
Mari is contrasted with biar in section 4.56.
Constructions with biar
Biar means ‘let, allow’. In imperatives it urges the addressee to 
allow a course of action to occur. It can refer to action by any 
person except the addressee. Particle -lah can be attached to 
biar:
Biar dia tidur!
Let him sleep!
Biarlah saya sendiri menemani dia!
Let me accompany him myself !
Biarlah undangan itu diantarkan sekarang!
Let the invitation be delivered now!
4.55

Mood 343
Mari and biar contrasted
Because mari urges the addressee to join with the speaker while 
biar excludes the addressee from participating, the former can 
co-occur with kita (see 4.54) while the latter can occur with any 
ﬁ rst or second person pronoun except kita, including kami ‘we 
(exclusive)’:
Mari kita pergi!
Let us (you and me) go!
Biar kami pergi!
Allow us (me and someone else) to go!
Exclamations
Utterances in exclamatory mood express the speaker’s feelings 
or attitude, usually in an emphatic way. They are often uttered 
forcefully, and in writing this may be indicated by an exclama-
tion mark. Exclamations may be single words, discussed in 
section 4.58, or sentences, discussed in section 4.59.
Interjections
Many exclamations are single words, also called interjections, 
which are usually uttered as an immediate reaction to some 
event to express surprise, anger and so on. There are a great 
many interjections; glosses to the following few examples do 
not attempt to catch the precise force of the Indonesian:
Aduh! Oh! Oh dear!
Astaga! Good heavens! Heaven forbid!
Brengsek! Useless! (exclamation of disapproval)
Cis! Bah! Tut! (exclamation of disgust)
Kasihan! Poor thing! What a pity!
Keparat! Damn!
Lho! Gosh! What!
Masa! Ridiculous! How could that be!
Sialan! Damn! Blast!
Interjections can be used to attract someone’s attention. 
Examples are given in section 4.110.
Interjections can be followed by a sentence in one of the 
other moods, which also tends to be exclamatory in tone:
4.56
4.57
4.58

344 Sentences
Wah! Mahal sekali!
Gosh! It’s really expensive!
Masyaalah! Lantas, bagaimana?
Good heavens! Then what happened?
Celaka! Dia kembali lagi!
Blast! He’s coming back!
Exclamatory sentences
Exclamatory sentences are equivalent to exclamatory sentences 
in English with ‘how’ followed by an adjective, although more 
frequently in informal English expressions using such interjec-
tions as ‘gosh’ are used. English exclamations with ‘what’ followed 
by a noun phrase have no direct equivalent in Indonesian; instead, 
an interjection followed by a statement may be used:
Wah, enak sekali masakan ini!
What a great meal!
The exclamatory sentence can consist of one of the forms bukan 
main, alangkah, betapa or (rarely) bukan buatan, followed by 
an adjective with -nya:
Bukan main besarnya! How big it is!
Alangkah bagusnya! How beautiful!
Betapa luasnya! How vast it is!
Bukan main can follow the adjective:
Panasnya bukan main! Gosh, it’s hot!
Bukan main can also occur alone as an interjection expressing 
astonishment:
Bukan main! Extraordinary!
A basic exclamation can be followed by a noun phrase indicat-
ing the person or thing having the quality referred to. The adjec-
tive corresponds to the predicate in a basic adjective clause (see 
3.9) and the noun phrase corresponds to the subject of such a 
clause. Each of the exclamatory sentences below is preceded by 
the basic clause corresponding to it:
Cerita itu lucu.
That story is funny.
4.59
4.60

Complex sentences 345
Betapa lucunya cerita itu!
Gosh that story is funny!
Malapetaka yang menimpa mereka besar.
The disaster which struck them was great.
Alangkah besarnya malapetaka yang menimpa mereka!
How great was the disaster which struck them!
The adjective in an exclamatory clause may correspond to an 
adverb in a basic clause. In this case it is followed by a subject–
predicate structure. For each of the following examples a basic 
clause containing an adverb is ﬁ rst given, followed by the 
exclamatory sentence based on it:
Mbak Koes menerima kami dengan ramah.
Mbak Koes received us hospitably.
Bukan main ramahnya Mbak Koes menerima kami!
How hospitably Mbak Koes received us!
Mereka bekerja dengan lambat.
They are working slowly.
Alangkah lambatnya mereka bekerja!
Gosh, they’re working slowly!
Mereka melawan teroris dengan gigih.
They opposed the terrorists resolutely.
Betapa gigihnya mereka melawan teroris!
How resolutely they opposed the terrorists!
Colloquially the adjective with -nya can occur alone, often 
following an interjection:
Wah, bagusnya!
Gosh, it’s beautiful!
Aduh, kotornya jalan ini!
Oh, this street’s dirty!
COMPLEX SENTENCES
Sentences are either simple or complex. A simple sentence 
consists of a single independent clause, accompanied by an 
intonation contour. Many of the sentences occurring in examples 
in Chapter 3 are simple sentences. A complex sentence is one 
which consists of more than a single clause.
When two clauses occur in the one sentence they are

sometimes linked by a conjunction. Conjunctions both link the 
clauses and specify the relationship between them. There are 
two types of conjunction. Coordinating conjunctions, some-
times called coordinators, link two independent clauses. These 
are discussed in sections 4.64–8. Coordinators can also link two 
phrases or words, as discussed in section 4.65. Subordinating 
conjunctions, also called subordinators, link an independent 
clause, called the main clause, and a clause which adds further 
information about the main clause. This is called a subordinate 
clause; it is always preceded by the conjunction. Subordinating 
conjunctions are discussed in sections 4.69–79.
Sometimes a sentence contains correlative structures in 
which two clauses, phrases or words are dependent on each 
other, neither being able to occur alone; these are discussed in 
sections 4.81–97.
Some sentences consist of a clause preceded by a word or 
phrase which links it to the preceding sentence. These construc-
tions are discussed in sections 4.98–104. Other sentences occur 
with a word or phrase, called a sentence adjunct, which provides 
a comment on what is said. These are discussed in sections 
4.105–8. A sentence can also contain a word which addresses 
the person being spoken to. Such words, called vocatives, are 
discussed in sections 4.109–10.
Coordination
Coordinators, or coordinating conjunctions, link two inde-
pendent clauses in a sentence. Coordinators which link 
two clauses include:
dan and
atau or
tetapi, tapi, akan tetapi but
lalu then
kemudian then, afterwards
serta and, as well as
dan bahkan and moreover, what’s more
sedangkan while, whereas
sementara while (at the same time)
 sambil, seraya while (of two actions performed by the same 
person)
4.64

Complex sentences 347
 Dia bekerja di bank sedangkan istrinya menjadi guru SMA.
He works in a bank while his wife is a high school teacher.
 Minah menjaga anak-anak sementara saya pergi berbelanja.
Minah minded the children while I went shopping.
If the coordinate clauses have the same subject it is usual for it 
to be ellipted from the second clause (see also 4.111):
Mobilnya terus melaju kencang, lalu putar ke kiri.
His car continued to travel along fast, then turned left.
 Dia bergaul dengan bebas dan bahkan membantu dengan 
pekerjaan kecil-kecilan.
He mixes freely and moreover helps with odd jobs.
Diambilnya mangga itu, kemudian dikupasnya hati-hati.
He took the mango, then he peeled it carefully.
The coordinators serta and sambil require the two clauses to 
have the same subject, the second being obligatorily ellipted:
 Mereka menaati nasihat orang tua serta mengikuti adat 
kebiasaan kita.
 They obey the advice of their parents and follow our 
customs.
Ibu memandang kami sambil tersenyum.
Mother looked at us while smiling.
Coordination of phrases and words
As well as linking clauses, coordinators can link two phrases or 
words. The two elements linked must be of the same kind:
laut yang bening dan tenang
a clear and calm sea
murid yang pandai tetapi malas
a clever but lazy pupil
Pak dan Bu Marto sudah lama kawin.
Mr and Mrs Marto have been married for a long time.
Mereka sudah pergi ke Jakarta atau ke Bandung.
They have gone to Jakarta or to Bandung.
Dia hanya duduk dan menangis saja.
He just sat and cried.
4.65

348 Sentences
When two transitive verbs are coordinate they have the same 
subject and object. The subject, along with any components of 
the predicate covering both verbs, occurs before the ﬁ rst verb 
and the object after the second verb:
 Majikan tidak bisa sembarangan memperkerjakan dan 
membayar pembantunya.
 An employer cannot employ and pay his servants just as he 
pleases.
Some coordinators do not link all construction types. A number, 
such as sedangkan and sementara (see 4.64), only link clauses. 
Among coordinators which do not link clauses are the follow-
ing.
Two adjectives can be linked by lagi ‘as well as’:
Terrier mungil lagi cerdas.
The terrier is cute as well as intelligent.
Two nouns or noun phrases can be linked by beserta ‘and, 
together with’:
 Para karyawan beserta keluarganya bahagia dan sejahtera.
 The employees together with their families are happy and 
prosperous.
Coordination of more than two items
More than two clauses, phrases or words can be coordinated. 
The coordinator usually occurs once, between the last two items. 
The most common coordinators are dan and serta:
Ini untuk hiasan dinding, meja serta kursi.
These are decorations for walls, tables and chairs.
Alternatively, coordinators may occur between each item. Rather 
than repetition of dan, the ﬁ nal two items are frequently linked 
by serta: a dan b serta c ‘a and b and c’.
This combination of coordinators may also occur if there is 
coordination at two levels within the one construction. In the 
following example dan links coordinate verbs, while the object 
consists of nouns joined by serta:
4.66
4.67

Complex sentences 349
 Mereka menjaga dan memelihara kebersihan serta ketera-
turan sekolah mereka.
 They care for and maintain the cleanliness and orderliness 
of their school.
Atau ‘or’ can also coordinate more than two items, usually only 
occurring between the last two items. In the following example 
atau links noun phrases, one of which contains two nouns also 
linked by atau:
 bagi suami yang kehilangan istri, bagi anak yang kehi-
langan ibu atau bapak, atau bagi negara yang kehilangan 
raykatnya
 for husbands who have lost their wife, for children who have 
lost their mother or father, or for countries which have lost 
citizens
Coordination without a coordinator
Two units can be coordinated without a coordinator being 
present; they are simply placed one after the other. This is 
sometimes called parataxis. In the ﬁ rst example below three 
clauses are linked in this way (dan being omitted); in the second 
example two numbers are linked (atau being omitted):
 Rumahku hancur, sapiku mati, sawahku tak bisa ditanami 
lagi.
 My house was destroyed, my cattle were dead, my ﬁ elds could 
not be planted any more.
Tiga empat ribu orang bekerja siang-malam di pabrik.
 Three or four thousand people work day and night in the 
factory.
Subordination
A sentence can consist of a main clause and a subordinate 
clause. The main clause can stand alone as a sentence (that is, 
it is an independent clause). The subordinate clause cannot 
stand alone, occurring either before or after the main clause 
to add information to it. The subordinate clause is preceded 
by a subordinating conjunction, sometimes called simply a 
conjunction. The type of information given by the subordi-
nate clause depends on the conjunction. Some conjunctions 
4.68
4.69

350 Sentences
also function as prepositions, as discussed in section 2.127. 
In sections 4.70–9 the main types of subordinate clause are 
discussed. Subordinate clauses can occur without a subordi-
nator, as discussed in section 4.80. The verb in the main clause 
is referred to as the main verb.
Clauses of time
These say something about when the action of the main clause 
occurs. Time conjunctions include:
sebelum before
sesudah, setelah after
sehabis after
sejak since
sampai until
ketika, waktu, tatkala when
The words ketika, waktu and tatkala refer to a speciﬁ c event in 
the past:
 Ketika/waktu/tatkala mereka tiba di tanah seberang, keluarga 
Pak Idris dan para transmigran lain harus membuka hutan.
 When they arrived in the outer island, Mr Idris’s family and 
the other transmigrants had to clear the forest.
A special type of subordinate clause of time contains the 
construction se- + verb + -nya. It indicates that the action of 
the main clause occurs immediately after the action of the 
sub ordinate clause. Only a limited number of verbs can occur 
in this construction, all having to do with arrival, the most 
common being setibanya ‘on (someone’s) arrival’:
Setibanya, dia langsung mandi.
On arriving, he immediately took a bath.
Sepulangnya dari Jakarta, ibu jatuh sakit.
On arriving home from Jakarta, mother fell ill.
The subordinate clause can contain an agent:
 Sesampainya mereka di rumah sakit, mereka diperiksa 
dokter.
 On their arrival at the hospital, they were examined by the 
doctor.

Complex sentences 351
 Setibanya saya di sana, saya membuka kebun di belakang 
rumah.
 On my arrival there, I made a garden at the back of the 
house.
Some people allow omission of -nya if the subordinate clause 
has an agent:
Sedatang beliau, kami boleh pergi.
On his arrival, we were allowed to go.
Clauses of condition
These indicate that the action of the main clause is con-
ditional in some way on occurrence of the action of the 
subordinate clause. Conjunctions include:
kalau, jika, jikalau if, when
bila, apabila, bilamana when, whenever, if
asal, asalkan provided that
seandainya, andaikata, sekiranya supposing that, if
While some of these words can refer to action in the past, and 
thus be translated ‘when’, they always indicate that the action 
of the main clause has occurred or will occur more than once, 
conditional on what is mentioned in the subordinate clause:
Kalau Lebaran dia selalu pulang ke Jawa.
When it’s Lebaran he always returns to Java.
Bila ada kesempatan, singgah di rumah saya.
If/whenever you have a chance, drop in at my place.
When referring to future action, English contrasts ‘when’ (which 
implies that the following action will occur) and ‘if’ (which 
implies there’s a possibility the action might not occur). In 
Indonesian, conditional forms are used to refer to future time 
without necessarily making this contrast. Whether a conditonal 
is better translated as ‘when’ or ‘if’ depends on the context:
 Malaysia bersedia mengurangi produksi minyak kalau/
apabila negara-negara lain juga bersedia berbuat 
demikian.
 Malaysia is prepared to lower oil production if other 
countries are prepared to do the same.

352 Sentences
Kalau pulang, tolong belikan nasi bungkus.
When you come home, please buy some take-away rice.
The conjunctions andaikata, seandainya and sekiranya often 
suppose something contrary to fact or something which is 
unlikely to occur:
 Seandainya/andaikata/sekiranya musyaﬁ r itu kembali ia 
tetap tidak akan memperoleh air minum.
 Supposing/if that traveller returned he still wouldn’t be given 
water to drink.
Clauses of reason
Subordinate clauses of reason indicate the reason for the action 
of the main clause. Subordinators include:
karena, oleh karena because
sebab, oleh sebab because
lantaran because
gara-gara because
mentang-mentang just because
kalau-kalau lest
Karena/sebab/lantaran sakit, dia tidak masuk sekolah.
Because she was sick, she didn’t go to school.
Mentang-mentang dia orang kaya, dia berbuat seenaknya.
Just because he’s a rich person, he does as he likes.
The conjunction kalau-kalau means ‘lest, in case’:
Kita tunggu di sini, kalau-kalau orangnya datang.
We’ll wait here, just in case the person comes.
Nanti ‘soon’ can be used to mean ‘lest’ as the reason for an 
imperative:
Jangan lari, nanti jatuh.
Don’t run, or you’ll fall.
Clauses of purpose
These indicate the purpose of the action of the main clause. 
Conjunctions are:
4.73
4.74

Complex sentences 353
supaya, agar, agar supaya so, so that
untuk, guna to, in order to
These also introduce complements (see 3.77–9 and 3.80–1), 
which occur only with particular verbs and are obligatory to the 
construction; subordinate clauses introduced by these conjunc-
tions can occur with any verb in the main clause and are optional. 
The structure of the subordinate clauses is the same as that of 
complement clauses. Supaya and agar are followed by a full clause, 
whose subject is usually different from the subject of the main 
clause; they correspond to ﬁ nite purpose clauses in English. If the 
subject is the same as that of the main clause it can be ellipted (see 
4.112 for an example). Untuk and guna introduce a clause whose 
subject is absent, being identical to the subject of the main verb; 
they correspond to non-ﬁ nite purpose clauses in English:
Dia mencuci rambutnya supaya bersih.
She washed her hair so that it was clean.
Kami berangkat pagi-pagi agar kami tidak terlambat.
We set off early in the morning so that we wouldn’t be late.
Saya harus pergi ke kantor pos untuk membeli perangko.
I have to go to the post ofﬁ ce to buy stamps.
 Mereka bertemu di Inggris guna membahas masalah-
masalah itu.
They met in England to discuss those matters.
While a complement always follows the main verb, a subordi-
nate clause introduced by supaya or agar can precede the main 
clause:
Agar kami tidak terlambat kami berangkat pagi-pagi.
So that we wouldn’t be late we set off early in the morning.
Clauses of extent
These indicate that the action of the main clause continues until 
or so that the action of the subordinate clause results. Conjunc-
tions include:
sehingga, sampai, hingga until, to the extent that, so that
Zainab memandangi mukaku, hingga aku jadi marah.
Zainab stared at my face until/so that I became angry.

354 Sentences
 Pencuri itu dikejar, sampai/sehingga/hingga dia ditangkap.
The thief was chased until he was caught.
These conjunctions can occur in correlative constructions, with 
begitu, demikian or sedemikian occurring in the ﬁ rst clause 
(see 4.88).
Clauses of concession
These clauses, often called concessive clauses, indicate that the 
action or state expressed in the main clause occurs despite what 
is stated in the subordinate clause. Subordinators, all of which 
can be translated ‘although’, include:
meski, meskipun
walau, walaupun
sekalipun
kendati, kendatipun
biarpun
sungguhpun
 Meskipun/walaupun dia amat capai, dia memasak untuk 
suaminya.
 Although she was extremely tired, she cooked for her 
husband.
Reduplicated adjectives can also carry a concessive meaning 
(see 1.17).
These conjunctions also introduce clauses in correlative 
relationship with clauses preceded by namun, as discussed in 
section 4.91.
The conjunction padahal ‘whereas, although’ introduces 
a clause which states something factual which contrasts with 
what is stated in the main clause:
Dia pura-pura tidak tahu, padahal dia tahu banyak.
He pretended not to know, whereas he knew a great deal.
Clauses of means and manner
Conjunction dengan ‘by, by means of’ indicates the means by 
which or the manner in which an action is perfomed:
4.76
4.77

Complex sentences 355
 Pencuri memasuki rumah dengan memecahkan kaca 
jendela.

Dengan bekerja keras kamu pasti akan lulus.
By working hard you will certainly pass.
Conjunction tanpa ‘without’ indicates a means or manner by 
which an action is not achieved:
 Dia meninggalkan isterinya tanpa memikirkan nasib 
anaknya.
He left his wife without thinking of the fate of his children.
Clauses of resemblance
These indicate that the action of the main clause is done in the 
way it would be done if what is stated in the subordinate clause 
were the case. Conjunctions are:
seakan-akan, seolah-olah as if
 Abdullah berbicara tentang kebaikan Lord Minto seakan-
akan orang Inggris itu layak disembah-sembah.
 Abdullah spoke of the kindness of Lord Minto as if the 
Englishman was ﬁ t to be worshipped.
Dia takut kepada saya seolah-olah saya ini musuhnya.
He’s afraid of me as if I were his enemy.
Clauses of contrast
These contrast what is said in the main clause with something 
else. Conjunctions are:
daripada rather than, instead of
alih-alih rather than, instead of
melainkan, tetapi but rather, instead
 Saya akan bertransmigrasi ke Irian Jaya daripada menjadi 
gelandangan.
 I will transmigrate to Irian Jaya rather than become a vagrant.
 Alih-alih naik kereta api, ia memilih naik pesawat 
terbang.
Instead of taking a train, he chose to go by plane.

4.79

356 Sentences
 Mereka tak menyerang tubuh seenaknya, melainkan 
memilih sasaran tertentu.

choose speciﬁ c targets.
Conjunction daripada can introduce a clause in correlative 
relationship with a clause introduced by lebih baik or sebai-
knya, as discussed in section 4.92.
Constructions with melainkan/tetapi are further discussed 
in sections 4.84–6.
Subordinate clauses without a subordinator
Subordinate clauses without a subordinator correspond to 
non-ﬁ nite clauses in English. The subordinate clause has no 
subject, the action being performed by the same person in both 
clauses.
The subordinate clause can occur before the main clause. In 
this case, the action of the main clause occurs immediately after 
the action of the subordinate clause. In some cases, the subordi-
nate clause also indicates the reason for the action of the main 
clause:
Melihat aku gugup, Zainab jadi reda.
Seeing me nervous, Zainab calmed down.
Mendengar cerita Narti, Totok berkata di dalam hati, ‘…
Hearing Narti’s story, Totok thought to himself, ‘…
Berhasil melarikan diri, ia pun mengembara di Eropah.
Managing to escape, he then wandered about in Europe.
The subordinate clause can follow the main clause. In this case 
the events in the two clauses occur at the same time. The subor-
dinate clause sometimes expresses the reason for the action of 
the main clause:
Hakim mengetukkan palu, menutup sidang.
The judge beat his gavel, closing the session.
 Pak Karim mendayung, menyeberangkan Muji kembali ke 
desanya.
Mr Karim rowed, taking Muji back across to his village.
Ia duduk di kursi, mengayun-ayunkan kakinya.
He sat on the chair, swinging his legs.

Complex sentences 357
Correlative structures
Sometimes two clauses, phrases or words are dependent 
on each other, such that neither can occur alone. The two 
units are correlative constructions or are said to have a 
correlative relationship. Usually each of the units is introduced 
by a conjunction or adverb, as discussed in sections 4.82–97.
Baik … maupun ‘both … and’
Emphasis can be placed on the fact that what is said applies to 
two words or phrases in coordination by placing baik before the 
ﬁ rst and maupun before the second. These words are a correla-
tive pair because baik anticipates the addition of what follows 
maupun:
Baik Ana maupun Ira tinggal di Jakarta.
Both Ana and Ira live in Jakarta.
Baik di kota maupun di desa sepak bola digemari orang.
Soccer is enjoyed both in the town and in the village.
If the accompanying predicate is negated, the construction 
means ‘neither … nor’:
 Baik kepandaian maupun kecantikan tidak berguna untuk 
mencapai kebahagiaan.
Neither ability nor beauty is useful for achieving happiness.
The word baik is sometimes omitted:
Mereka berjuang untuk bangsa maupun untuk keluarga.
They ﬁ ght both for the nation and for their family.
If more than two items occur in coordination, baik is placed 
before the ﬁ rst and maupun before the last:
 Baik orang Cina, orang Jepang, orang India maupun orang 
Portugis berdagang di Jakarta.
 Chinese, Japanese and Indians, as well as Portuguese, traded 
in Jakarta.
Correlative structures with bukan
There are several correlative structures in which the ﬁ rst unit 
is preceded by bukan ‘not’. These are discussed in sections 
4.84–7.
4.81
4.82
4.83

358 Sentences
Bukan … melainkan/tetapi ‘not … but rather’
These constructions contain two clauses. The ﬁ rst, introduced 
by bukan, is stated to be incorrect, while instead the second, 
introduced by melainkan or tetapi, is stated to be true. Bukan 
does not occur within the ﬁ rst clause, but rather negates the 
whole clause; a negative can occur within the clause predicate, 
as in the second example below. Bukan usually occurs before 
the subject of the clause and can optionally take -nya:
Bukan dia bodoh, melainkan dia malas.
It’s not that he’s stupid, but rather that he’s lazy.
 Bukannya saya tidak mau membeli rumah, tetapi uang 
saya tidak cukup.
 It’s not that I don’t want to buy a house, but that I don’t have 
enough money.
The two clauses can have the same subject, expressed before the 
ﬁ rst clause. In this case bukan can follow the subject:
 Ia bukannya memerankan si Doel, melainkan menjadi 
sutradara.
He isn’t playing the part of Doel, but rather is the director.
In some cases the second clause is so clearly implied by the ﬁ rst 
clause that it can be omitted:
Saya bukan tidak percaya kepadamu.
I don’t disbelieve you.
If bukan occurs after the subject and is not followed by -nya 
or tidak it can be regarded as occurring within the predicate 
of the clause. If it occurs with other than a noun predicate it is 
emphatic, anticipating the contradictory clause to follow (see 
2.137):
Dia bukan bodoh, melainkan malas saja.
He’s not stupid but just lazy.
If emphasis is absent, bukan can be replaced by tidak; the ﬁ rst 
clause is then simply a basic clause, followed by a subordinate 
clause introduced by melainkan or tetapi (see also 4.79):
Kami tidak pergi ke Solo, melainkan ke Yogya.
We didn’t go to Solo but to Yogya.
4.84

Complex sentences 359
Correlative subordinate clauses of purpose
A sentence can state that an action is performed not for one 
purpose but for another. In this case, correlative subordinate 
clauses of purpose introduced by untuk (see also 4.74) occur. In 
English ‘not’ usually occurs before the verb of the main clause 
rather than before the ﬁ rst subordinate clause. In Indonesian 
bukan occurs before the verb of the ﬁ rst subordinate clause:
 Dia pergi ke Indonesia bukan untuk tinggal di hotel tetapi 
untuk bergaul dengan rakyat.
 He didn’t go to Indonesia to stay in a hotel but to mix with 
the people.
Bukan hanya … melainkan/tetapi juga ‘not only … but also’
The correlative structure may indicate that not only does 
the action of the ﬁ rst clause occur but so too does the action 
of the second clause. The ﬁ rst clause contains bukan hanya 
‘not only’ and the second is introduced by tetapi/melainkan 
juga ‘but also’. Extra emphasis can be given to hanya, occurring 
before the predicate of the ﬁ rst clause, by placing saja after the 
predicate:
 Candi Borobudur bukan hanya sebuah monumen berse-
jarah saja, tetapi juga ramai didatangi orang.
 The Borobudur temple is not just a historical monument but 
it is also visited by many people.
Other correlative structures with bukan
The second clause can be introduced by several other words, 
including asal(kan) ‘provided that’, which sets a con dition on 
the occurrence of the action of the ﬁ rst clause:
 Saya bukan tidak rela kau membantu familimu, asal kau 
pertimbangkan juga kebutuhan kita sendiri.
 I’m not unwilling for you to help your relatives, provided 
you also consider our own needs.
Begitu/(se)demikian … sehingga/sampai ‘so … (to the extent) 
that’
Subordinate clauses of extent are discussed in section 4.75. If 
the main clause is an adjective clause, the sentence can indicate 
that the action or state of the subordinate clause is a result of 
4.85
4.86
4.87
4.88

360 Sentences
the extent of the quality mentioned in the main clause. The 
main clause contains begitu, demikian or sedemikian, which 
are actually modifying adverbs within the adjective phrase (see 
2.100):
Dia begitu gembira, sehingga dia menangis.
He was so happy that he cried.
 Harganya sedemikian mahal, sehingga tidak ada yang mau 
beli.
The price was so expensive that no one wanted to buy it.
Dia demikian lelah, sampai tidak dapat berjalan lagi.
She was so tired that she couldn’t walk any further.
If preceded by demikian or sedemikian, the adjective can take 
-nya. Some people regard -nya as obligatory in this situation:
 Udara sedemikian panasnya, sampai banyak orang pingsan.
The air was so hot that many people fainted.
Instead of being the predicate of an adjective clause, the adjec-
tive phrase may function as an adverb of manner in the ﬁ rst 
clause:
 Dia lari begitu cepat sehingga sangat sukar untuk 
memotretnya.
 She was running so fast that it was very difﬁ cult to photo-
graph her.
Instead of an adjective rupa can occur, the phrase begitu/
demikian rupa meaning ‘in such a way’:
 Haji itu membentak aku begitu rupa hingga mukanya 
menimbulkan rasa jijikku.
 The haji snapped at me in such a way that his face aroused 
my disgust.
Correlative structures with begitu ‘no sooner … than’
In these constructions the ﬁ rst clause is introduced by 
begitu ‘no sooner’. The second clause, which has no formal 
marker, refers to an action which immediately follows on the 
action of the ﬁ rst clause. In English the second clause begins 
with ‘than’:
4.89

Complex sentences 361
 Begitu timbul penyakit baru, segera juga ditemukan obatnya.
 No sooner does a new illness appear than a medicine is 
discovered for it.
Begitu musim hujan tiba, jalan itu tertutup air.
 No sooner does the wet season arrive than those roads are 
covered in water.
A few reduplicated intransitive verbs can function in the same 
way as begitu in this construction (see 1.24).
Correlative structures with modifying adverbs like makin … 
makin ‘the more … the more’
Two adjective clauses (see 3.9) can occur in a correlative rela-
tionship to indicate that as the degree of the ﬁ rst adjective 
increases so too does the degree of the second. Each adjective 
is preceded by one of the modifying adverbs makin, semakin, 
kian, tambah, bertambah ‘increasingly’ (see 2.100). Both 
clauses can have the same subject:
Ali makin besar makin sombong.
The older Ali gets the more arrogant he becomes.
Orang itu tambah tua tambah kaya.
The older that person gets the richer he becomes.
The ﬁ rst clause can contain lama ‘long (of time)’. Such construc-
tions indicate that the degree of the adjective in the second 
clause increases as time goes on. The construction is similar 
in meaning to a single clause having the same adjective, except 
that the correlative construction puts emphasis on the gradual 
intensity in the quality over time. The ﬁ rst example below is 
preceded by a single clause containing the same adjective:
Ali makin kurus.
Ali is getting thinner.
Ali makin lama makin kurus.
(As time goes on) Ali is getting thinner and thinner.
Harga barang semakin lama semakin tinggi.
The price of goods is continually rising.
Hari ‘day’ can replace lama, in this construction also meaning 
‘long (of time)’:
4.90

362 Sentences
Golongan itu bertambah hari bertambah kuat.
 That group is getting stronger and stronger (as time 
goes on).
The two clauses can have different subjects; each subject usually 
occurs after its predicate:
 Makin tinggi pangkat orang, makin banyak persoalan yang 
dihadapinya.
 The higher the position of a person, the more problems he faces.
Kian berat penderitaan orang, kian dekat ia pada Tuhan.
The greater a person’s suffering, the closer he comes to God.
The correlative relationship may be between adverbs of manner 
or other adjuncts within two clauses, rather than between 
predicates. The adverb occurs ﬁ rst in each clause:
 Makin sering mereka bertemu, makin sering mereka 
bertengkar.
 The more frequently they meet, the more frequently they 
quarrel.
 Makin lama orang tinggal di kota besar, makin enggan 
mereka kembali ke desa.
 The longer people live in a big city, the more reluctant they 
are to return to the village.
Meskipun … namun ‘although … nevertheless’ and related 
structures
Meskipun ‘although’ and similar words introduce sub-
ordinate clauses of concession (see 4.76). Instead of occurring 
with a main clause they can occur in correlative relationship 
with a clause beginning with namun ‘nevertheless’. This empha-
sises the contrast between what is stated in the two clauses. The 
clause with meskipun must come ﬁ rst:
 Meskipun sawahnya banyak, namun kenikmatan hidup 
sedikit.
 Although he has many rice ﬁ elds, nevertheless the pleasures 
of life are few.
The other subordinators of concession listed in section 4.76 can 
also occur, such as biarpun:
4.91

Complex sentences 363
 Biarpun sumbangannya tidak seberapa, namun dia 
mempunyai peranan dalam proyek raksasa ini.
 Although his contribution doesn’t amount to much, 
nevertheless he has a role in this giant project.
Instead of namun, the second clause can begin with toh ‘never-
theless’ or contain juga ‘anyway’ after the predicate. All three 
can occur together, which gives especially strong emphasis to 
the contrast between the two clauses:
 Meski keterangan Suryaman seru, toh terasa kurang 
meyakinkan.
 Although Suryaman’s explanation was loud, it was 
nevertheless unconvincing.
Meskipun hujan lebat, si Amat pergi juga.
Although it was raining heavily, Amat went anyway.
Meskipun sakit, namun anak-anak ini toh sekolah juga.
 Despite being sick, nevertheless these children go to school 
anyway.
Closely related in meaning are constructions in which the ﬁ rst 
clause does not begin with a conjunction, while the second clause 
ends with juga. These indicate that the action of the second 
clause occurs despite what is mentioned in the ﬁ rst clause. The 
second clause frequently begins with tetapi ‘but’:
Dia tidak diundang, tetapi dia datang juga.
He wasn’t invited but he came anyway.
Lebih baik/sebaiknya … daripada ‘it’s better that … rather 
than’
A contrast of the type ‘it’s better that … rather than’ can occur 
between two clauses. Either clause can occur ﬁ rst. The clause 
beginning with lebih baik/sebaiknya frequently also contains 
saja ‘just’, which emphasises the contrast between the two 
clauses:
Daripada mati kelaparan, lebih baik kita pindah saja.
Rather than die of hunger, it’s better that we move.
Sebaiknya mereka menyerah saja, daripada melawan.
It’s better that they just surrender rather than ﬁ ght.
4.92

364 Sentences
Bagaimanapun/betapapun [adjective] -nya … namun/toh 
‘no matter how [adjective] … nevertheless’
These constructions indicate that no matter how much of a 
certain quality there is, nevertheless a certain action or state 
will occur. The quality is expressed in the ﬁ rst clause, which 
is an adjective clause; -nya is attached to the adjective. The 
second clause is introduced by namun or toh ‘nevertheless’:
 Betapapun baiknya orang Eropah itu pada kita, toh mereka 
takut mengambil risiko.
 No matter how kind those Europeans are to us, nevertheless 
they will be afraid to take risks.
Namun may be absent from the second clause:
 Bagaimanapun terbukanya pemikiran Nurcholish, di 
kalangan kebanyakan umat pemikiran itu agak susah 
diterima.
 No matter how open Nurcholish’s thinking is, among most 
congregations that thinking is rather hard to accept.
Bagaimanapun can also link the following clause with the 
preceding sentence (see 4.100).
Correlative structures with baru ‘not until’
Baru occurs in a sentence containing a subordinate clause of 
time (see 4.70) or within a clause containing an adjunct of 
time (see 2.182ff) to indicate that the action of the main verb 
does not occur until the time of the action of the subordi-
nate clause or the time mentioned in the adjunct. Baru can 
precede either the time element or the main clause:
 Baru setelah keluar dari desa ketiga tokoh kita dapat naik 
dokar.
 Not until they were out of the village could our three char-
acters get in the carriage.
Baru pukul sepuluh berita itu diketahui.
The news was not known until ten o’clock.
Sore hari, sehabis bekerja, baru kita pulang.
Not until evening, after ﬁ nishing work, do we go home.
Malam harinya baru aku pergi ke Hotel Homan.
I didn’t go to Hotel Homan until night-time.
4.93
4.94

Complex sentences 365
Entah … entah ‘whether … or’
This construction indicates that something occurs whether it is the 
result of one thing or another. The structure frequently consists 
of two clauses, each preceded by entah, stating the alternative 
causes, and followed by a third clause stating the effect. Ellipsis 
of some clause elements (see 4.111) in the clauses preceded by 
entah is usual:
 Entah dia bodoh entah malas, dia tidak pernah 
menyelesaikan pekerjaannya.
Whether he’s stupid or lazy, he never ﬁ nishes his work.
 Entah disetujui entah tidak, dia tetap akan mengusulkan 
gagasannya.
 Whether it’s agreed to or not, he will continue to propose 
his idea.
The clause stating the effect may occur ﬁ rst:
 Kalau mati secara alami biasanya monyet ini tidak ditemu-
kan, entah dikubur oleh monyet lainnya, entah kebiasaan 
monyet itu menyembunyikan diri sebelum mati.
 If they die of natural causes these monkeys are usually not 
found, whether because they are buried by other monkeys or 
because it is their habit to hide themselves before dying.
Kalau/apabila … maka ‘if … then’
Kalau and apabila ‘if’ introduce a subordinate clause of condi-
tion (see 4.72). Instead of occurring in a sentence with an inde-
pendent clause this can co-occur with a clause beginning with 
maka ‘then’, which states a consequence:
 Apabila pemerintah Sri Langka tidak mengambil langkah 
tegas, maka India akan protes.
 If the Sri Lankan government does not take ﬁ rm steps then 
India will protest.
 Kalau teori ini benar, maka jawaban itu harus kita pertim-
bangkan lagi.
If this theory is correct then we must rethink the answer.
Jangankan … pun ‘not only … even’
This construction indicates that not only does the action indi-
cated by the verb apply to the ﬁ rst phrase, which is surprising 
enough, but it even applies to the second phrase:
4.95
4.96
4.97

366 Sentences

dihormati.
 Not only other people, but even his parents he doesn’t 
respect.
Jangankan rumah, kamar pun belum punya.
He doesn’t even have a room yet, much less a house.
 Jangankan Ida Betara, saya pun risi kalau melihat jemuran 
di depan pura.
 Let alone Ida Betara, even I would be disgusted to see laundry 
(hanging up) in front of the temple.
Sentence linkers
Sentence linkers, sometimes called linking adjuncts, are similar to 
conjunctions. However, instead of linking one clause to another 
within a sentence they link two sentences, at the same time indi-
cating the kind of connection there is between the two sentences. 
In the following example namun ‘nevertheless’ is the sentence 
linker. It indicates that the situation in the second sentence occurs 
in spite of what is stated in the ﬁ rst sentence:
 Mereka tahu dia menderita penyakit lepra. Namun, mereka 
tidak takut.
They know he has leprosy. Nevertheless, they are not afraid.
There are a large number of sentence linkers, describing a 
variety of relationships between two sentences. Some of the 
more common linkers are listed in sections 4.99–104. Some 
linkers also function as conjunctions and so are discussed in 
sections 4.70–9 as well.
While a linker usually comes ﬁ rst in the sentence this is 
not always the case; it can occur within the main clause of the 
sentence. In the following example the second sentence consists 
of a clause and the linking adjunct malahan ‘moreover’. The 
linker follows kadang-kadang ‘sometimes’, which is a time 
adjunct within the clause:
 Di rumah sering diadakan pesta. Kadang-kadang, malahan, 
mereka mendatangkan band dan penyanyi-penyanyi.
 In the house parties are often held. Sometimes, moreover, 
they bring in a band and singers.

Complex sentences 367
Linkers indicating an addition
The second sentence can contain a related comment to the ﬁ rst 
sentence or information which reinforces the ﬁ rst sentence. 
Linkers include:
lagi pula further, what’s more
di samping itu besides that
juga also
selain itu besides that, apart from that
kecuali itu besides that
selanjutnya further
bahkan moreover, even
apalagi moreover, besides
malah, malahan moreover, what’s more
 Sejak kecil penduduk Bangunarjo mengalami hidup di 
lingkungan yang sehat dan teratur. Selain itu, oleh desa 
dikembangkan pula usaha di bidang industri rumah, 
seperti pertenunan.
 From childhood the people of Bangunarjo have known life 
in a healthy and orderly environment. Besides that, efforts in 
the area of home industry, such as weaving, have also been 
developed by the village.

mother.
 Ia tidak mau masuk sekolah. Lagi pula, ia tidak mau belajar 
di rumah.
 He doesn’t want to go to school. What’s more, he doesn’t 
want to study at home.
Linkers indicating contrast
The second sentence can contrast in some way with the ﬁ rst 
sentence, sometimes indicating that the action of the second 
sentence occurs despite what is stated in the ﬁ rst sentence. 
Linkers include:
namun, namun demikian despite that, nevertheless
 walaupun demikian, namun begitu despite that,

 Barangkali engkau berhelat dengan alasan bahwa ayah 
keras kepala. Bagaimanapun juga, kau telah salah melang-
kah.
 Perhaps you are using the excuse that father is being obstin-
ate. However that may be, you have acted wrongly.
The contrast shown in the second sentence may be strength-
ened in several ways, such as by use of juga ‘also, anyway’:
Dia tidak belajar. Namun, dia lulus ujian juga.
He didn’t study. Nevertheless, he passed the exam anyway.
The linkers malah, malahan and bahkan also mean ‘moreover’ 
(see 4.99 and the example of malahan in 4.98). Meaning ‘instead, 
on the contrary’, they usually follow a negative sentence:

consequence of what is stated in the ﬁ rst sentence. Linkers 
include:

could it be
maklum(lah) bear in mind; this is understandable since

Sentence adjuncts
There are many adjuncts which are not part of a clause but are 
used with a clause or series of clauses to convey the speaker’s 
comment on what is being said. These are sentence adjuncts, 
also called sentence adverbials or disjuncts. While most sentence 
adjuncts occur at the beginning of the sentence, some can 
follow the subject of the ﬁ rst clause. Sentence adjuncts include 
the following.
Sentence adjuncts which indicate a feeling or opinion
Some sentence adjuncts give information about the speaker’s 
feeling or opinion about the events stated in the sentence. They 
include:
sayang unfortunately, what a pity
malang unfortunately
untung fortunately, luckily
mudah-mudahan, moga-moga, semoga hopefully
syukur thankfully, thank God
sebaiknya it is best, it is preferable
seharusnya, semestinya should, ought
pantas, patut it is understandable, no wonder
Insya Allah God willing
Untung, maling dapat dihalau penjaga.
Fortunately, the burglar was chased away by the guard.
Insya Allah, mereka selamat dalam perjalanan.
God willing, they will have a safe journey.

372 Sentences
A number of these adjuncts are given more emphasis by addition 
of -lah (see 3.51):
Syukurlah, orang tua saya begitu luas pandangannya.
Thankfully, my parents are so broad-minded.
Untunglah, kini ada kebijakan baru!
Thank goodness, there is now a new policy!
Sentence adjuncts which indicate likelihood or truthfulness
Some adjuncts express the speaker’s attitude towards the 
likelihood of something occurring or existing or towards 
the truth of what is being said. These include:
rupanya, agaknya, kiranya apparently, it seems
mungkin possibly
barangkali perhaps, maybe
nampaknya, tampaknya it seems, it looks
pasti, tentu certainly
ternyata apparently, it turns out that
jelas it is clear, clearly
memang indeed
terus-terang frankly
sebenarnya, sebetulnya, sesungguhnya in fact, actually
tentu saja, tentunya of course, certainly
setahu saya as far as I know
pada hemat saya in my opinion
kalau saya tidak salah if I’m not mistaken
Desas-desus itu ternyata tidak benar.
That rumour turns out not to be true.

4.107

Complex sentences 373
Sentence adjuncts which report what is said
Several adjuncts indicate that something is said or believed by 
other people. These include:
konon it is said
katanya, kata orang people say, it is said
menurut mereka/dia according to them/her/him
 Konon dahulu kala datanglah seorang musyaﬁ r ke daerah 
ini di musim kemarau.
 It is said that long ago a traveller came to this region during 
the dry season.
Following kata the name of a particular person can replace 
orang, meaning ‘(someone) says; according to (someone)’. This 
is different from a direct quote clause (see 3.95) because what 
follows is indirect speech:
Kata Bu Kusno, gadis itu ialah kemenakannya.
According to Mrs Kusno, that girl was her niece.
In addition to the phrase beginning with menurut ‘according to’ 
there are other possible constructions with the same meaning, 
also followed by a noun phrase which indicates who holds such 
an opinion:
 Di mata mayoritas umat Islam, para orientalis itu adalah 
musuh agama.
 In the eyes of the majority of Moslems, those orientalists are 
the enemies of religion.
Vocatives
A vocative is a word which addresses the person being spoken to. 
Vocatives are usually names or kinship terms but can also be titles 
or markers of profession or rank. Vocatives often come at the end 
of the sentence and tend to make the utterance politer or more 
familiar. They tend to occur more frequently than in English:
Selamat pagi, pak/bu.
Good morning (addressed to a man/woman).
Jangan kuatir, dik.
 Don’t worry (to a younger person with whom the speaker is 
familiar: dik, adik ‘younger sibling’)
4.108
4.109

374 Sentences
Sakit apa dia, dokter?
What’s wrong with her, doctor?
Vocatives are also used to attract the attention of the person 
being addressed. They are used in this way at or near the begin-
ning of the sentence. They can also occur alone:
Pak Hasan!
Mr Hasan!
Tessa, kamu cantik sekali.
Tessa, you are very pretty.
The vocative can be preceded by an interjection (see 4.58) to 
attract the addressee’s attention:
Nah, teman-teman, mari mulai.
Now, friends, let’s begin.
Hai Tok, kau kelihatan murung benar.
Hey Tok, you look really miserable.
While titles are retained in vocatives, diminutive si (see 2.35) 
and honoriﬁ c sang (see 2.36) are not. Thus a younger person 
can be addressed as dik Muji ‘(younger brother) Muji’ or as 
Muji, but not as si Muji.
ELLIPSIS
Ellipsis refers to the omission from a sentence of a word when 
its presence is not necessary, often because the word has already 
occurred, either in the same sentence or in a preceding one. 
Sometimes pronouns can be omitted in Indonesian where their 
presence is required in English. In the examples in sections 
4.112–17, pronouns in translations to examples are placed in 
square brackets where the corresponding form in Indonesian 
is ellipted.
Ellipsis of subject
A subject can be omitted if it is clear from context. In the follow-
ing example Ki Demang is spoken to in the ﬁ rst sentence; rather 
than a second person pronoun, in the second sentence ellipsis 
occurs:
4.110
4.111
4.112

Ellipsis 375
 O, sombong kau, Ki Demang. Diminta air, malahan meny-
ombongkan kekayaan.
 Oh, you are arrogant, Ki Demang. [You] are asked for water, 
instead [you] boast about [your] wealth.
The subject need not have been mentioned previously in the 
discussion; it is sufﬁ cient that who is being talked about is clear 
from context for pronouns to be ellipted:
‘Makan malam di luar?’ …
 ‘Diundang teman lama,’ sahut Febrian dengan perasaan 
bersalah.
‘Are [you] dining out?’ …
 ‘[I]’ve been invited by an old friend,’ replied Febrian with a 
feeling of guilt.
If two clauses are in coordination and have the same subject, the 
subject of the second clause can be ellipted:
Mereka sudah lama kawin, tetapi belum punya anak.
 They have been married a long time but [they] don’t yet have 
any children.
Further examples, with a variety of coordinators, are given in 
section 4.64.
The subject of a subordinate clause can be omitted whether 
it precedes or follows the main clause:
Ali tidak pergi ke sekolah karena sakit.
Karena sakit Ali tidak pergi ke sekolah.
Because [he] was sick Ali didn’t go to school.
If the subordinate clause occurs ﬁ rst it can retain the subject. 
In this case the noun can be replaced by a pronoun in the main 
clause. However, the subject cannot be omitted entirely from 
the main clause:
Karena Ali sakit, dia tidak pergi ke sekolah.
Because Ali was sick he didn’t go to school.
Ellipsis of the subject after supaya/agar when acting as a 
complement is discussed in section 3.122. The subject can also 
be ellipted if supaya introduces a subordinate clause (see 4.74):

376 Sentences
 Dia pergi ke perpustakaan supaya (dia) dapat membaca 
buku.
He went to the library so that [he] could read a book.
Ellipsis of subject nouns referring to non-humans
When a noun referring to a human is understood from context 
it is usually represented by a pronoun, as repetition of the 
noun would sound awkward. In the case of a noun referring 
to anything other than a human there is no corresponding 
pronoun in many positions in the sentence (see 2.74). In such 
cases, ellipsis is an alternative to stylistically awkward repeti-
tion of the noun. In the following example nira ‘palm juice’ is 
omitted from the second sentence:
 Nira tidak bisa dibiarkan lama. Kalau tidak segera dimasak 
akan cepat jadi rusak.
 Palm juice cannot be left long. If [it] is not boiled at once [it] 
will quickly spoil.
In section 3.39 is an example where, after initial mention, kaki 
ayam ‘the chicken leg’ is ellipted in three following clauses.
Retention of parts of the noun phrase in ellipsis
Certain components of a noun phrase can occur without a head 
noun; for example, a relative clause can occur without a head 
noun. This is a nominalised relative clause, as discussed in sections 
3.131–5. A number with a classiﬁ er or measure noun can also 
occur without a noun. Other components of the noun phrase, 
such as adjectives, attributive nouns and possessives, cannot occur 
if the head noun is omitted. In the following example the quanti-
ﬁ er measure noun segelas ‘a glass (of something)’ is retained in 
the second sentence while the head noun susu ‘milk’ is ellipted. 
In the third sentence the subject is a nominalised relative clause, 
yang lain ‘the other’, gelas (susu) being ellipted:
 Dia datang membawa susu dua gelas. Segelas diletakkan-
nya di atas meja. Yang lain dibawanya padaku.
 She came carrying two glasses of milk. She put one glass on 
the table. The other she brought to me.
4.113
4.114

Ellipsis 377
All nominalised relative clauses result from ellipsis of the head 
of the noun phrase, examples being given in sections 3.131–5.
Ellipsis of words other than the subject
If an action or state has been mentioned it need not be repeated 
in the following clause. Instead, the following clause may 
contain just the subject and any words which do not occur in 
the preceding clause or contrast with what has been said:
Saya sudah makan tapi mereka belum.
I’ve eaten but they haven’t yet.
 Majikannya tidak tahu ke mana dia pindah. Teman-teman-
nya juga tidak tahu.
 Her employer didn’t know where she had moved to. Her 
friends didn’t know either.
Multiple ellipsis
It is not uncommon for ellipsis both of subject and other redun-
dant components of a clause to occur together. The following 
sentence repeats an example given in section 4.95, with ellipted 
components of the correlative subordinate clauses presented in 
square brackets:
 Entah [gagasannya] disetujui entah [gagasannya] tidak 
[disetujui], dia tetap akan mengusulkan gagasannya.
 Whether it is agreed to or not, he will continue to propose 
his idea.
Ellipsis of possessives
Possessive pronouns can be ellipted. This is especially common 
in the case of inalienable possession, such as referring to body 
parts, when it is obvious who the possessor is:
Dia mengulurkan tangan kepadaku.
He held out [his] hand to me.
Mereka sedang menggosok gigi.
They are cleaning [their] teeth.
Ellipsis in responses
In conversation, ellipsis frequently occurs in one person’s 
response to what another says.
4.115
4.116
4.117
4.118

378 Sentences
In response to a question, words occurring in the question 
are usually not repeated:
Q: Siapa nama saudara? 
A: Jim.
 
What’s your name? 
 
Jim.
Q: Berapa harganya? 
A: Tiga ribu.
 
How much is it? 
 
Three thousand.
Q: Kapan saudara berangkat? 
A: Besok pagi.
 
When do you leave? 
 
Tomorrow morning.
Responses to yes–no questions, in which ellipsis is usual, are 
discussed in section 4.13.
Ellipsis is often used in a question when the context makes it 
clear what is meant; often just the question word is used:
Ada orang cari anda. 
– Siapa?
There’s someone looking for you. 
– Who?
When agreeing with someone or commenting on what they 
have said, ellipsis is also usual:
Saya sudah ke sana. 
– Saya juga.
I’ve been there. 
– I have too.

NOTES
Chapter 1
 1 Square brackets are used to indicate the pronunciation of 
the word they contain rather than their orthography.
 2 For those who are interested in the ﬁ ne details of pronunci-
ation, it is noteworthy that with some Indonesian speakers the 
pronunciation of t is a bit different from that of d and n: with 
t, the tip of the tongue is held against the teeth, whereas 
with d and n it is held against the alveolar ridge (the hard part 
of the palate which is immediately above the upper teeth). 
 3 A hard g as in ‘go’, not as in ‘gym’.
 4 Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia (1993: 120) recognises 
only the menge- forms as standard. Abdul Chaer (1988: 270) 
takes the same position and advises against the use of forms 
such as mempel and mentik. On the other hand, Badudu 
(1986: 89–90) regards both forms as standard. Echols and 
Shadily (1989) and Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991) 
frequently list both forms.
 5 These sentences are taken from Simatupang (1983: 112). 
Indonesians display a great deal of uncertainty and dis-
agreement as to what is permissible when reduplicating 
constructions involving two nouns (noun with follow-
ing modifying or possessive noun). Simatupang presents a 
detailed consideration of this topic (1983: 110–20).

380 Notes
 6 The discussion of reduplicated pronouns, together with 
examples, is adapted from Kaswanti Purwo (1984: 64).
 7 There is disagreement as to the acceptability of some forms. 
Thus Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991) gives membiru 
‘become blue’, whereas Dardjowidjojo (1978: 264) rules this 
word out. Such disagreement reﬂ ects a degree of productiv-
ity and the gradual spread of meN- to an increasing number 
of adjective bases.
 8 Anderson (1983: 6) notes that in a particular survey meN- 
was dropped in only 21 per cent of cases when the addressee 
was a stranger, a situation in which language is likely to be 
more formal, but was dropped in up to 67 per cent of cases 
when the addressee was a member of the speaker’s family, a 
situation in which informal style is most likely.
 9 This was pointed out by Hein Steinhauer in a personal 
communication.
10 While such constructions are common in modern Indo-
nesian and generally considered well formed, some people 
regard them as sub-standard, resulting either from analogy 
with constructions in which the beneﬁ ciary is not expressed, 
or confusion with constructions in which -kan has a non-
benefactive function (see Samsuri 1981: 8), or from inter-
ference from Javanese (see Verhaar 1984: 36–7). Johns (1978: 
226) states that -kan must drop in such constructions.
11 Thus Dardjowidjojo (1978: 352) allows both Saya mengirimi 
mereka uang saku and Saya mengirim mereka uang saku 
‘I send them pocket money’, while Johns (1978: 232) treats 
-i as obligatory in Paman mengirimi saya uang tiap bulan 
‘Uncle sent me some money every month’.
12 This has prompted a number of grammarians, such as 
Badudu (1983: 45–6), to discuss the ‘correct’ usage of 
menugasi and menugaskan, the latter being acceptable 
only with an object identifying the patient.
13 There is disagreement as to the acceptability of some forms. 
Thus Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991) gives mencan-
tikkan ‘make beautiful’, whereas Dardjowidjojo (1983: 261) 
rules this out, allowing only mempercantik. 
14 Uncertainty as to the meanings of these forms is shown, for 
instance, by the two editions of Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa 

Notes 381
Indonesia. The ﬁ rst edition (1988: 115) gives memperistrikan 
and mempersuamikan different meanings from memper-
istri and mempersuami respectively. The second edition 
(1993: 138) gives the forms with and without -kan as having 
the same meanings, the sufﬁ x simply being optional.
15 These examples are based on Johns (1981: 86).
16 These examples are based on Johns (1978: 251, 253).
17 Abdul Chaer (1988: 303) advises against the use of forms like 
ketipu ‘tricked’ and ketabrak ‘collided with’, recommend-
ing the use of ter- forms, such as tertipu and tertabrak, 
instead. 
Chapter 2
 1 This example is taken from McGarry and Sumaryono, 
book 3 (1974: 42).
 2 The ﬁ rst example is from Toer (1980: 28). Kaswanti Purwo 
(1984: 114) rejects the use of mereka to refer to non-human 
nouns.
 3 Verhaar (1988: 56) says dari is more colloquial than daripada 
‘but not distinctly substandard’, while Tata Bahasa Baku 
Bahasa Indonesia (1988: 216) says dari is non-standard. 
Chaer (1988: 163) advises against use of dari in comparative 
constructions. However, while this stand is taken by some 
grammarians, it is not generally accepted and dari is by far 
the more frequent of the two in both formal and informal 
Indonesian.
 4 For more indepth study of prepositions see Djenar (2007).
 5 This example is from Kaswanti Purwo (1984: 81).
 6 These two examples are taken from Slametmuljana (1969: 
382).
Chapter 3
 1 The terms ‘passive type one’ and ‘passive type two’ are used 
by Dardjowidjojo (1978).
 2 This example and preceding comments are based on Poed-
josoedarmo (1986: 3).
 3 In linguistic terms Indonesian can be described as a sym-
metrical voice language (see Himmelmann 2005).
 4 This example is quoted by Slametmuljana (1969: 345).

382 Notes
 5 This example is from Dardjowidjojo (1978: 165). Such 
constructions are rejected by Verhaar (1984: 62), among 
others.
 6 The relationship between alienable and inalienable posses-
sion and the possibility of word order change in such 
constructions is discussed by Verhaar (1978).
 7 This example is from Lapoliwa (1990: 202).
Chapter 4
 1 Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia (1988: 187) states that 
siapa/apa must always become predicate, the subject being 
a nominalised construction with yang. On the other hand, 
Johns (1978: 139) allows active clauses with the interrogative 
as subject, such as Siapa membeli pakaian? ‘Who bought 
some clothes?’
 2 The Classical Malay example is from the Hikayat Pandawa 
Lima, quoted by Kaswanti Purwo (1984: 186). The other 
two examples are from Verhaar (1984: 53) and Toer (1980: 
314) respectively.
 3 Among many texts which assert that -lah makes an impera-
tive more polite are Johns (1978: 23), Sarumpaet (1977: 145) 
and Dardjowidjojo (1978: 108–9). Dardjowidjojo calls it an 
‘imperative particle’. On the other hand, Sugono (1986: 55) 
states that -lah makes a command ﬁ rmer.
 4 This example is from Johns (1978: 276).

INDEX
Main entries are alphabetical except that plural s is ignored. Sub-entries 
are not alphabetical but generally in order of occurrence in the grammar. 
Afﬁ xes are listed alphabetically by their ﬁ rst letter, the hyphen being 
ignored. A free word is placed in order before a homophonous afﬁ x; thus 
anda precedes -anda.
The symbol > before a sub-entry cross-references to the same item as 
a main entry for further information.
