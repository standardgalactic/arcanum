Abstract 
Autophagy delivers cytoplasmic material to the lysosome for degradation, and has 
been implicated in many cellular processes, including stress, infection, survival, and 
death. Although the regulation and role that autophagy plays in stress, infection, and 
survival is apparent, its involvement during cell death remains relatively unclear. In this 
thesis I summarize what is known about the roles autophagy can play in cell death, and 
the differences between the utilization of autophagy during nutrient deprivation and cell 
death. Utilizing Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, the roles autophagy plays in 
both of these contexts can be studied. The goal of this thesis is to provide a better 
understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that distinguish between autophagy as a 
survival mechanism and autophagy as a cell death mechanism. From my studies I was 
able to determine that microRNAs can regulate autophagy in vivo, and that the 
microRNA miR-14 controls autophagy specifically during the destruction of the larval 
salivary glands of Drosophila melanogaster. I found that miR-14 regulates autophagy 
through modulation of IP3 and calcium signaling, and this miR-14 control of IP3 and 
calcium signaling does not influence the induction of autophagy during nutrient 
deprivation. Therefore, this knowledge demonstrates how autophagy can be regulated to 
distinguish its use during cell survival and death providing insight into how autophagy 
can used to treat diseases.

CHAPTER I 
Introduction and background 
 
“A man doesn't say I will starve myself to death to keep from starving . . . Why then 
should he be willing to die for the privilege of living?” 
-- Dalton Trumbo, Johnny Got His Gun 
 
Part I: To live or to die 
 
 To ensure proper organism development and survival, cells need to be able to 
adapt to and cope with a range of environmental and developmental situations. Two 
methods of adaptation that organisms have evolved include promoting cell survival and 
inducing programmed cell death. The decision to implement cell survival or cell death 
programs can be influenced by various stimuli including nutrient sensing and 
developmental cues. The necessity and connectivity of both cell survival and cell death to 
ensure the growth, development, and homeostasis of an organism cannot be understated, 
and defects in these processes can result in diseases such as cancer (Fuchs & Steller, 
2011; Hietakangas & Cohen, 2009). Therefore, it is essential to understand the regulatory 
mechanisms that control and distinguish cell survival and cell death.  

 
2 
 
Nutrient deprivation can be detrimental to an organism; starvation can result in 
altered or arrested development and can lead to organism death (Beadle et al., 1938; 
Butterworth et al., 1965; Johnson et al., 1984; Salas et al., 1974). Therefore, a cell’s 
ability to recognize and respond to nutrient deprivation is critical. Cell death also plays 
pivotal roles in the health of an organism by allowing for the destruction of obsolete cells 
and tissues during development as well as promoting organism health by removing 
infected, damaged, and old cells (Clarke, 1990; Schweichel & Merker, 1973; Takizawa et 
al., 1993). 
The regulation, implementation and coordination of cell survival and cell death 
programs are essential to ensure organism robustness. Interestingly, the catabolic process 
of autophagy can function as a cellular tool that can be utilized in both contexts. 
Although detailed knowledge exists describing the regulation of autophagy and its 
importance during cell survival, relatively little is understood regarding its involvement 
in programmed cell death. Clearly, differences exist that allow for the utilization of 
autophagy to achieve completely opposite cellular fates. However, what those differences 
are, and how they influence the role autophagy plays in these contexts remains unclear. 
 
Part II: Autophagy 
 
Autophagy comes from the Greek words auto meaning “self” and phagein 
meaning “to eat”, and refers to the intracellular degradation of cellular material by the 
lysosome. In 1957 Clark  described mitochondria within cellular vacuoles (Clark, 1957), 

 
3 
 
and in 1962 Ashford and Porter observed organelles such as mitochondria within hepatic 
cell lysosomes after the addition of glucagon (Ashford & Porter, 1962). Shortly later, 
Novikoff and Essner described the formation of lysosomes, and suggested that these 
vesicles could be degrading mitochondria (Novikoff & Essner, 1962). All of these 
accounts are among the first descriptions of what would later be called autophagy. 
Currently, three forms of autophagy are commonly described: chaperone-mediated 
autophagy, micro-autophagy, and macro-autophagy (Boya et al., 2013). Chaperone-
mediated autophagy involves the selective targeting of proteins by chaperones to the 
lysosomes for degradation without the formation of new vesicles (de Duve & Wattiaux, 
1966; Kaushik & Cuervo, 2012; Terlecky & Dice, 1993). Micro-autophagy is less 
understood, and involves the direct engulfment and degradation of cellular material by 
the lysosome (Ahlberg et al., 1982; de Duve & Wattiaux, 1966; Li et al., 2012). Macro-
autophagy (which will henceforth be the focus of this thesis and referred to as autophagy) 
consists of the encapsulation of cellular material by a vesicle that fuses with lysosomes 
for degradation.  
Autophagy initiates with the formation of the pre-autophagosomal structure which 
serves as a nucleation point for the formation of the isolation membrane. The isolation 
membrane encapsulates cellular material such as proteins and organelles in a double 
membrane vesicle called an autophagosome (Mizushima & Komatsu, 2011). Lysosomes 
then fuse with the autophagosome forming an autolysosome subsequently enabling their 
hydrolases to degrade the isolated contents (Mizushima & Komatsu, 2011). The 

 
4 
 
autophagic steps can be analyzed by methods that have been previously described 
(Klionsky et al., 2012). 
 
Pioneering genetic studies in yeast led to the identification of the autophagy 
(ATG) related genes and proteins (Harding et al., 1996; Harding et al., 1995; Klionsky et 
al., 2003; Thumm et al., 1994; Tsukada & Ohsumi, 1993). Autophagosome formation 
occurs through the coordination of two protein complexes: the Atg1 complex and the 
vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) complex, two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems: the 
Atg8-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation system and the Atg12-5 conjugation 
system, and a membrane binding protein Atg9.  
The Atg1 complex consists of the serine/threonine kinase Atg1, and the Atg1 
regulatory proteins Atg13, Atg17 and Atg101. The Atg1 complex is necessary for the 
initiation of autophagy through interactions and phosphorylation of other proteins leading 
to the formation of the pre-autophagosomal structure (Figure 1.1) (Chang & Neufeld, 
2009; Taichi Hara et al., 2008; Hosokawa, Sasaki, et al., 2009; Kamada et al., 2000; Kim 
et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2004).  
The Vps34 complex consists of the class III PI3K Vps34, a serine-threonine 
kinase Vps15, Atg14 and Atg6, and promotes the nucleation of the autophagosomal 
membrane (Figure 1.1) (Kihara et al., 2001; Liang et al., 2008; Lindmo et al., 2008; 
Shravage et al., 2013; Takahashi et al., 2007).  
The Atg8-PE conjugation system promotes the elongation of the isolation 
membrane, and involves the cleavage of Atg8 by Atg4 (Kirisako et al., 2000). PE is 

 
5 
 
subsequently conjugated onto Atg8 through the E1 activating enzyme Atg7 and the E2 
conjugating enzyme Atg3 (Ichimura et al., 2004; Kim et al., 1999; Schlumpberger et al., 
1997; Shintani et al., 1999; Tanida et al., 1999). Atg5 of the Atg5-12/16 complex then 
acts as an E3-like ligase facilitating the conjugation of PE to Atg8. After conjugation, 
Atg8-PE then localizes to the inner and outer membranes of the forming autophagosome 
(Figure 1.1) (Hanada et al., 2007).  
The Atg12-5 conjugation system consists of the E1 activating enzyme Atg7 and 
the E2 conjugating enzyme Atg10 by which Atg12 is conjugated with Atg5. After 
conjugation, Atg12-5 forms a complex with Atg16. This Atg5-12/16 complex then 
localizes to the forming autophagosomal membrane where Atg5 functions as an E3-like 
ligase facilitating the lipidation of Atg8 (Figure 1.1) (Hanada et al., 2007; Romanov et 
al., 2012).  
Atg9 is the only known Atg protein with a trans-membrane domain; it can span 
multiple membranes, and is thought to recruit material to the forming autophagosomes as 
well as help in the recycling of autophagosomes (Figure 1.1) (Reggiori et al., 2004; 
Yamamoto et al., 2012). Significantly, the core autophagy machinery is conserved from 
yeast to humans, indicating that studies of model organisms can enhance our 
understanding of how autophagy may function in distinct cellular and physiological 
contexts in humans. 
Most studies have focused on understanding how autophagy functions in the 
context of nutrient deprivation-triggered cell survival. For example, under nutrient rich 

 
6 
 
conditions, the TOR complex 1 (mTORC1) can directly regulate the formation of the 
Atg1 complex through phosphorylation of Atg1 and Atg13. Therefore, under starvation 
conditions when mTORC1 is inactive, the active Atg1 complex induces autophagy to 
degrade and recycle cellular material (Chang & Neufeld, 2009; Kim et al., 2011; 
Ravikumar et al., 2004). Unfortunately, less is known about how autophagy may 
contribute in other contexts, and more work is needed to understand where and how 
autophagy may be involved in cellular processes such as programmed cell death.

Figure 1.1. A simplified cartoon of autophagic induction. 
The induction of autophagy starts with the activations of the Atg1 complex, which 
induces the formation pre-autophagosomal structure, and the Vps34 complex, which 
starts autophagosome nucleation. The activation of these complexes results in the 
conjugation and activation of the Atg5-12/16 complex and Atg8-PE, both of which are 
necessary for autophagosome formation. Lysosomes dock and fuse with the 
autophagosome, and lysosomal hydrolases degrade the internal components of the 
autophagosome. Atg9 is involved in membrane trafficking autophagosomal recycling.

Part III: Autophagic cell death 
In 1973, Schweichel and Merker described three types of physiological cell death 
that occurred in the developing embryos and fetuses of rats and mice (Schweichel & 
Merker, 1973). In type I cell death, isolated dying cells displayed condensation of the 
nucleus and cytoplasm, and phagocytosis of the dying cells by neighboring cells resulting 
in the subsequent degradation of the dying cell by the lysosomal system of the engulfing 
cells. Type I cell death is known as apoptosis (Kerr et al., 1972). Currently, apoptosis is 
the most studied form of cell death, and the genetic control and molecular mechanisms of 
apoptosis are relatively well understood. Both extrinsic and intrinsic signals can induce 
the apoptotic pathways in a cell resulting in the cleavage and subsequent activation of a 
variety of cysteine-aspartic proteases called caspases (Brenner & Mak, 2009; Juo et al., 
1998; Varfolomeev et al., 1998). Cleavage of caspases can be measured with cleavage-
specific antibodies thereby providing readout of caspase activity (Srinivasan et al., 1998; 
see Figure 2.3F and 2.3G for an example). Interestingly, caspases have also been 
implicated in other cellular process than apoptosis such as immunity and type II cell 
death (Kang et al., 2004; Martin & Baehrecke, 2004). In type I cell death, the activation 
of caspases during cell death result in the cleavage of specific protein substrates such as 
nuclear lamins and DNase repressive proteins thereby resulting in the fragmentation of 
DNA thereby promoting the death of the cell (Cohen, 1997). During apoptosis, the dying 
cell displays a “come eat me” that signals for phagocytosis resulting in its degradation. 

 
9 
 
In type II cell death, groups of dying cells were removed in toto with no 
phagocytosis by neighboring cells. Schweichel and Merker observed that these dying 
cells contained autophagosomes that isolated regions of their cellular contents, and fused 
with the dying cell’s own lysosomes to self-degrade the autophagosomes’ contents. Type 
II cell death is known as autophagic cell death (explained in more detail later).  
Finally, in type III cell death, which is also called necrosis, Schweichel and 
Merker observed the swelling of membrane compartments, membrane rupture and 
“disintegration” of the dying cells with no apparent phagocytosis or lysosomal elements 
associating with this process (Schweichel & Merker, 1973).  
 
A. Autophagy and the promotion of cell death 
Descriptive studies originally suggested that autophagy controls cell death 
(Clarke, 1990; Schweichel & Merker, 1973). However, the clear role of autophagy in 
promoting health and survival in many cell contexts indicates that mechanistic studies are 
needed to clearly determine the difference in how autophagy can promote cell death 
(Mariño et al., 2014). In addition, to be able to modulate autophagy for therapeutic 
purposes it is useful to know the mechanisms underlying the promotion of cell death by 
autophagy versus cell health and survival by autophagy. Unfortunately, it remains unclear 
how autophagy can promote cellular death.  

 
10 
 
Several possibilities have been proposed for how autophagy may promote cell 
death, and multiple mechanisms may exist. One possibility is that key survival factors are 
selectively recruited into autophagosomes for degradation, and multiple studies support 
this possibility. For example, programmed cell death occurs during fly oogenesis, and the 
inhibitor of apoptosis Bruce was shown to co-localize with autophagosomes as well as 
accumulate in autophagy-defective cells (Nezis et al., 2010). In addition, recruitment of 
cytoplasmic catalase into autophagosomes was shown to lead to elevated ROS and cell 
death in L929 cells (Yu et al., 2006).  
An alternative model is that high levels of autophagy may deplete mitochondria 
and metabolic substrates, and that this could cause a type of metabolic catastrophe that 
causes cell death. Although it is unclear if this actually occurs, data from flies suggest 
this possibility. For example, activation of autophagy by mis-expression of the Atg1 
kinase is sufficient to kill multiple cell types, including the larval fat body, salivary 
glands and midgut (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; Chang et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2007). 
Interestingly, this cell death in fat body is delayed by expression of the caspase inhibitor 
p35, while it is caspase-independent in salivary glands (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; Scott 
et al., 2007).  
Recent work in mammalian cells suggests multiple mechanisms for how 
autophagy may promote cell death. In one case, Ras-triggered cell death was associated 
with displacement of Mcl-1 from Beclin1 by Bcl-2 family member Noxa that led to 
autophagy-dependent cell death (Elgendy et al., 2011). By contrast, Tat-Beclin 1-

triggered autophagic cell death depends on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase function (Liu et al., 
2013), and while it is possible this functions in other dying cells that depend on 
autophagy, this has never been previously reported.  Although it is intriguing to consider 
such mechanisms, more work needs to be done to be certain these processes function in 
animals. 
 
B. Genetic systems  
In recent years, autophagic cell death has been observed in distinct eukaryotic 
kingdoms from which the studies of genetic model systems have illuminated the roles 
that autophagy can play in dying cells.  
 
B1. Vertebrates 
Since its description (Schweichel & Merker, 1973), autophagic cell death has 
been observed in multiple cell types during development in a variety of vertebrates, 
including mouse, rat, chick, and frog (reviewed in (Clarke, 1990). Unfortunately, our 
knowledge of autophagic cell death in vertebrates is vague. Therefore, the evidence for 
autophagic cell death in vertebrates is based almost exclusively on observations in which 
dying cells showed high levels of autophagy with no evidence of apoptosis. As such, it 
remains unclear if autophagy actually plays an active role in the death of some or all of 
these examples. This gap in our knowledge needs to be overcome through in depth 

 
12 
 
genetic studies of these vertebrates’ dying cells in which autophagic cell death has been 
reported. 
 
Although it is obvious that more complete genetic studies are needed to fully 
understand the roles autophagy can play in vertebrate programmed cell death, a few 
studies have attempted to determine the role autophagy may or may not play during 
mammalian development. For example, embryoid bodies derived from cells lacking ATG 
genes failed to undergo cavitation, a process that is reminiscent of developmental 
programmed cell death (Qu et al., 2007). However, it was concluded that in this context 
autophagy is used to signal to clear the cell corpses and not as a means to achieve cell 
death. It should be noted that this study was done with embyroid bodies, and, may not be 
a complete representation of what occurs during true animal development. Therefore, 
further studies are needed. 
 
Although analyses of a role of autophagy in dying animals is lacking, multiple 
studies using derived cell lines suggest the possibility that autophagic cell death occurs in 
mammals. For example, Ras-induced autophagy was sufficient to trigger caspase-
independent cell death (Elgendy et al., 2011). Additionally, activation of autophagy was 
shown to be sufficient to kill cultured cells when exposed to the autophagy-inducing 
peptide, Tat-Beclin 1, in a process termed autosis (Liu et al., 2013). Moreover, autosis 
was also observed in vivo during cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury in rats. Although these 
findings were not obtained in developmental contexts, they indicate that autophagy can 
play an active role during cell death. 

 
13 
 
 
B2. Dictyostelium discoideum 
Dictyostelium is a protist that can exist in either a unicellular or multicellular 
state. During the formation of its multicellular fruiting body, the supportive stalk cells 
which comprise approximately 20 percent of all Dictyostelium cells undergo programmed 
cell death (Whittingham & Raper, 1960). Having evolutionarily diverged around one 
billion years ago, Dictyostelium represents one of the most primitive and ancient 
examples of programmed cell death (Baldauf et al., 2000). Interestingly, Dictyostelium 
does not possess phagocytes, and no caspases have been found in its genome. Therefore, 
apoptosis is impossible, and all cell death occurs via autophagy (Giusti et al., 2009). 
 
During starvation, unicellular Dictyostelium begins to aggregate and form a 
multicellular fruiting body full of viable spores atop a stalk of dead cells. As the stalk 
cells die they exhibit high levels of autophagy. During this death process, the stalk cells 
first induce autophagy as a response to starvation, and only after this starvation-induced 
autophagy is initiated do they receive an additional signal from the differentiation-
inducing factor, DIF-1, to promote programmed cell death (Cornillon et al., 1994; de 
Chastellier & Ryter, 1977). Interestingly, sole induction of autophagy or the presence of 
DIF-1 alone cannot induce cell death (Levraud et al., 2003; Town et al., 1976). Therefore, 
autophagy in Dictyostelium appears to be first induced as a starvation response, and only 
later, along with additional signals, can cell death occur via a mechanism in which 
autophagy is also necessary (Giusti et al., 2009). 

 
14 
 
 
In Dictyostelium, the regulation of starvation-induced autophagy appears to be 
well conserved as homologues of mTOR complex 1 exist in the Dictyostelium genome. 
However, the mechanism of how the transition from the use of autophagy for starvation 
to the use of autophagy for death remains less clear. While it is known that starvation 
induced autophagy is necessary for cell death to occur in Dictyostelium, as mentioned 
earlier, another factor, DIF-1, is also necessary. Unfortunately, the DIF-1 signaling 
pathway has not been fully elucidated. Genetic screens in Dictyostelium have revealed 
certain genes that are necessary for the completion of autophagic cell death that is 
triggered though DIF-1, such as iplA (the IP3 receptor) (Lam et al., 2008).  
 
B3. Arabidopsis thaliana 
Unlike metazoans, plants do not exhibit apoptosis because the cell wall of plants 
prevents the breakdown of cells into apoptotic bodies, and plants have neither phagocytes 
nor canonical caspases (Hofius et al., 2011). However, it should be noted that the 
activation of caspase-like proteases have been detected during certain types of cell death 
(Tsiatsiani et al., 2013), but the physiological consequences of these metacaspases 
remains unclear. As such, autophagic cell death is one of the primary means of cell death 
in plants, and has been observed in Arabidopsis during developmental cell death as well 
as the pathogen-triggered hypersensitive response (Hofius et al., 2011). 
 
 In plants, the tracheary element of the xylem serves as a means of water-
conducting vessels. During tracheal development in Arabidopsis, the tracheary elements 

 
15 
 
undergo programmed cell death in order to remove the contents from the center of the 
tracheal vessel. In Arabidopsis, autophagy has been shown to be activated during 
tracheary element differentiation in cell culture, and that the autophagy gene, Atg5, was 
required for cell death during tracheary differentiation (Kwon et al., 2010). This indicates 
that autophagic cell death can occur during plant development. 
 
The hypersensitive-response in plants serves as a mechanism to prevent the 
spread of pathogens, and is characterized by localized cell death around a region of 
infection. Interestingly, during the Arabidopsis hypersensitive-response, autophagy 
appears to be able to function in both a pro-survival and pro-death manner depending on 
the context of the infection (Hofius et al., 2011). Interestingly, this context-specific dual 
use of autophagy is similar to the roles that autophagy can play in tumor cells as either a 
pro-survival or pro-death mechanism. In Arabidopsis, days after infection, loss of 
autophagy was shown to result in the inability to prevent the spread of cell death in non-
infected cells around the site of infection (Liu et al., 2005), indicating that autophagy is 
required for survival. Conversely, autophagy has also been shown to be induced in 
infected cells shortly after infection, and hypersensitive-response cell death was 
suppressed by autophagy gene mutants (Hofius et al., 2009). As such, it appears that the 
use of autophagy as a means to either prevent the spread of disease-induced cell death or 
as a mechanism to kill uninfected cells depends on disease contexts, and the time after 
infection. 
 

 
16 
 
B4.  Drosophila melanogaster 
The Drosophila larva is essentially an eating and growing machine. During its 
larval stages, the animal increases in mass by approximately 200 fold in approximately 
seven days (Robertson, 1963). To achieve such rapid growth, the larva has developed 
larval-specific tissues. As the focus of the adult fly is no longer growth, the adult does not 
need the growth-oriented tissues of the larva. During metamorphosis, these obsolete 
larval-specific tissues are degraded, and new adult-specific structures are formed. While 
undergoing metamorphosis, the animal does not intake any new organic material, and 
therefore, the animals must recycle the degraded larval material to form the adult 
structures (Ashburner, 1967; Bodenstein, 1965; Robertson, 1936). Presumably, as the 
relatively fast development of the adult occurs, the destruction and recycling of the larval 
structures must occur quickly and on schedule. As these larval structures comprise a large 
amount of the animal, the fly has evolved methods to rapidly and efficiently degrade and 
recycle this material. During metamorphosis, the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone 
(ecdysone) signals for many of these obsolete larval tissues to undergo programmed 
destruction. Two of these tissues, the larval midgut and salivary glands, degrade through 
programmed autophagic cell death (Aizenzon & Zhimulev, 1975; Berry & Baehrecke, 
2007; Denton et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2002). Additionally, during metamorphosis, the 
larval fat body ecdysone signals for the induction of autophagy, but it is unclear if this 
induction leads to cell death. Interestingly, before metamorphosis, another tissue, the 
larval fat body, induces autophagy during nutrient deprivation as a cell survival 
mechanism (Scott et al., 2004).  

 
17 
 
 
 
B4a. The larval midgut of Drosophila 
The larval midgut is analogous to the mammalian intestine, and contains nutrient 
uptake cells, secretory cells, and progenitor cells. During metamorphosis, the Drosophila 
pupa remodels its intestinal system by degrading the larval midgut and creating an adult 
version. Just prior to its destruction, the larval midgut of Drosophila comprises a large 
amount of the total volume of larval tissue.  At puparium formation, ecdysone signals for 
the destruction of this tissue, and within four hours, the entire midgut has essentially died 
(Lee et al., 2002) (Figure 1.2). The destruction of this tissue in toto is a classic hallmark 
of the type II cell death described by Schweichel and Merker (Schweichel & Merker, 
1973). After the ecdysone pulse at puparium formation (referred to as 0 hour), cell 
growth arrest occurs through inhibition of the PI3K pathway (Denton et al., 2012), and 
shortly after this cell growth arrest, high levels of autophagy can be observed during 
midgut degradation (Lee et al., 2002) (Figure 1.3C). Furthermore, when autophagy genes 
are mutated or cell growth fails to arrest, autophagy is inhibited, and the midgut does not 
degrade (Denton et al., 2009). Interestingly, at the time of cell death, midgut cells are 
TUNEL-positive indicating DNA fragmentation, a sign that caspases could be active. 
However, caspases play no role in the destruction of the midgut as their inhibition does 
not hinder cell death (Denton et al., 2009). Currently, no involvement of phagocytes has 
ever been observed during midgut cell death. Therefore, autophagy is the sole known 
cellular process necessary for the self-degradation of the larval midgut during cell death 

 
18 
 
and degradation, and autophagy is important for a programmed cell size reduction and 
clearance of mitochondria from these dying cells (Chang et al., 2013). 
 
B4b. The larval salivary glands of Drosophila 
 
Each Drosophila larva has two salivary glands that facilitate the digestion of food 
and the production glue peptides during pupariation (Wigglesworth, 1972; Zhimulev & 
Kolesnikov, 1975). Interestingly, unlike the midgut, the salivary glands do not initiate 
autophagy at the 0 hour ecdysone pulse. Rather, approximately 12 hours after the 
initiation of midgut cell death, another pulse of ecdysone signals for the degradation of 
the larval salivary glands in toto. Presumably, the salivary glands do not degrade at the 
same time as the midgut because the glands are still needed for the production and 
secretion of glue peptides. Therefore, regulatory differences evolved to distinguish the 
timing of the destruction of these two tissues. Much like the midgut, promptly after the 0 
hour ecdysone pulse, cell growth arrest occurs in the salivary glands through inhibition of 
the PI3K pathway. However, unlike the midgut, autophagy is not  induced in the salivary 
glands until the second pulse of ecdysone 12 hours later (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; 
Denton et al., 2012) (Figures 1.2 and 1.3D).  
Like the midgut, during cell death, salivary gland cells become TUNEL positive, 
and no phagocytes appear to be involved (Martin & Baehrecke, 2004; McPhee et al., 
2010). Additionally, high levels of autophagy occur, and genetic inhibition of autophagy 
results in incomplete gland degradation (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; Lee & Baehrecke, 

 
19 
 
2001). However, unlike the midgut, in addition to autophagy, caspases are also necessary 
for salivary gland destruction. Interestingly, these two processes appear to function 
independently of each other, and both are needed to ensure complete tissue degradation. 
Therefore, when one process, either autophagy or caspases, is inhibited, partial 
degradation of the salivary glands still occurs (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007). Although 
caspases and autophagy apparently function independently of each other in the salivary 
glands, their inductions appear to be linked as genes involved in steroid signaling 
including the Ecdysone Receptor, nuclear receptor coregulators and the histone H3 lysine 
trimethyl demethylase dUTX are necessary for the transcription of both caspase and 
autophagy genes (Denton et al., 2013; Ihry & Bashirullah, 2014).  
 
B4c. The larval fat body of Drosophila 
 
The larval fat body is analogous to the mammalian liver and adipose tissue, and 
serves as the storage depot for nutrients in the developing larva (Butterworth et al., 1965). 
The fat body is involved in nutrient sensing and the production of antimicrobial peptides 
(Colombani et al., 2003; Manfruelli et al., 1999). During periods of starvation, high levels 
of autophagy can be observed in the fat body thereby mobilizing its energy stores (Scott 
et al., 2004). In Drosophila, insulin-like peptides play pivotal roles in signaling the 
nutrient state of the animal to various tissues. In the fat body, insulin-like signaling can 
result in the modulation of pathways such as PI3K and mTOR both of which influence 
cellular processes such growth, translation, and autophagy. Therefore, nutrient 

 
20 
 
deprivation of Drosophila can result in the direct induction of autophagy through 
inhibition of the PI3K and mTOR pathways in the fat body thereby promoting cell 
survival through autophagic recycling (Géminard et al., 2009; Scott et al., 2004). 
Interestingly, the fat body also responds to the ecdysone pulse at 0 hours by inhibiting 
PI3K signaling and arresting cell growth. At this time, autophagy is induced and is 
dependent on the ecdysone signal. Fascinatingly, it appears that this ecdysone-induced 
autophagy may be regulated differently than the induction of autophagy during the 
starvation of larvae (Rusten et al., 2004) (Figures 1.2, 1.3A and B). However, it is 
debated whether this ecdysone-induced autophagy in the fat body results in the death of 
these cells.

Figure 1.2. A cartoon depiction of ecdysone-induced autophagy and the 
developmental changes in the fat body, midgut and salivary glands. 
An ecdysone pulse at puparium formation (0 hours) signals for the arrest of cell growth in 
the fat body (green), midgut (yellow), and salivary glands (blue). This 0h pulse also 
signals for the induction of autophagy in the midgut and fat body, but not the salivary 
glands. The induction of autophagy in the midgut leads to its destruction. The induction 
of autophagy in the fat body is debated, but is thought to contribute towards cell death. 
Another pulse of ecdysone 12 hours after the previous pulse signals for the induction of 
autophagy as well as the activation of caspases in the salivary glands leading to its 
destruction.

(A) Starvation induces autophagy as a cell survival mechanism by inhibiting the PI3K 
pathway.  
(B and C) The ecdysone pulse at puparium formation (0h) induces autophagy through the 
Ecdysone Receptor in the fat body and midgut by inhibiting the PI3K pathway and 
possibly through other, unknown factors. The role of ecdysone-induced autophagy in 

 
23 
 
the fat body (B) is unclear. The role of ecdysone-induced autophagy in the midgut (C) 
is to promote cell size reduction and cell death. 
(C) The ecdysone pulse at puparium formation (0h) inhibits the PI3K pathway through 
the Ecdysone Receptor, but does not induce autophagy. Rather, the ecdysone pulse 12 
hours later induces autophagy through the Ecdysone Receptor. It should be noted that 
PI3K inhibition at 0h is necessary for the induction of autophagy at 12h. 
 
 
 

 
24 
 
B4d. Regulation of autophagy in Drosophila 
 
The core ATG genes are necessary for the induction of autophagy in multiple 
contexts including starvation and programmed cell death during the life cycle of 
Drosophila. However, the means of regulating the induction in specific contexts are 
different. The mechanisms that control autophagy as a starvation response are well 
understood, and the mTOR complex plays a pivotal role in nutrient sensing and directly 
regulates the induction of autophagy via ATG proteins (Scott et al., 2004). Interestingly, 
during larval development, mTOR signaling is required for cellular growth in the salivary 
glands and midgut. Additionally, the Hippo signaling pathway is required for growth in 
the salivary glands. As these processes prevent the induction autophagy, arrest of these 
pathways is necessary to allow for the induction of autophagy during programmed cell 
death (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; Denton et al., 2012; Dutta & Baehrecke 2008). It is 
assumed that the arrest of these growth signaling pathways in both of these tissues is 
because animals stop feeding at this stage in development, but how this dietary 
information is transmitted to these tissues and if insulin-like peptides are involved 
remains unclear. While growth arrest is critical to allow for the induction of autophagy, 
the exact mechanisms of how autophagy is induced during cell death remain relatively 
unknown. For example, the engulfment receptor Draper has been shown to regulate 
autophagy during salivary gland degradation (McPhee et al., 2010). Although steroid 
signaling may regulate their function, it is unclear how these genes specifically regulate 
the autophagy machinery. Furthermore, the E1 enzyme ATG7 is not required for 
autophagy in dying fly midgut cells even though it is required for most other autophagy 

 
25 
 
that has been studied, including starvation-induced autophagy in Drosophila (Chang et 
al., 2013). In order to better understand the regulatory differences in the uses of 
autophagy further investigation is needed.  
 
B4e. Approaches to study autophagy in Drosophila 
Classical genetic and full genome sequencing approaches resulted in a 
sophisticated map of the Drosophila genome. Furthermore, recent deep sequencing-based 
transcriptome experiments have led to extremely detailed annotations of genes and gene 
expression patterns. From these annotations, conserved ATG genes have been identified. 
Furthermore, the well annotated Drosophila genome has allowed for the quick 
identification and study of novel regulatory mechanisms of autophagy during the 
destruction of the midgut as well as the salivary glands. This knowledge combined with 
the ability to conduct genetic experiments with single cell resolution in an intact 
organism make fruit flies an ideal system to study the relationships between autophagy, 
cell survival and cell death. 
Drosophila is one of the premiere animal model systems that are used to identify 
new genes that function in processes using forward genetic approaches (Bernards & 
Hariharan, 2001). In addition, transposable P-element based genetic engineering has also 
allowed for the development of multiple important genetic approaches, such as clonal 
mutant cell analysis, targeted mutagenesis, transgenesis, and RNA interference (Klionsky 
et al.) among many others. Significantly, the development of binary gene expression 

 
26 
 
systems, such as the GAL4/UAS system (Brand & Perrimon, 1993), has enabled the 
study of gene function at the cellular, tissue, and organism level. With this technology, 
the well annotated Drosophila genome allows for robust reverse genetic approaches such 
as either targeted gene disruption (Rong & Golic, 2000) or RNAi using one of the 
multiple whole genome collections to study the roles and regulation of autophagy. 
Using these genetic tools, the roles autophagy plays in both cell survival and cell 
death can be studied in great depth. Animals can be staged such that the midgut as well as 
salivary glands can be dissected when autophagy is induced during their destructions. 
Moreover, larvae can be deprived of nutrients, and the fat body can be dissected to 
observe the levels of autophagy during starvation. Various transgenic, mutant, and RNAi 
based screens have led to the identification of novel genes that function to regulate 
autophagy in multiple contexts. Additionally, epistasis experiments using various 
mutants, RNAi, and transgenic animals can be used to determine where genes genetically 
function relative to one another. Utilizing these tools, autophagy can be analyzed using a 
variety of assays including histology, immunochemistry, fluorescently tagged proteins, 
and cell size measurement. 
 
C. Autophagy and disease  
The potential benefits of understanding the mechanisms of autophagy cannot be 
understated. Our knowledge about cancer, neurodegeneration, and other age-associated 

 
27 
 
diseases are likely to benefit from a clearer understanding of how autophagy functions 
during cell survival and cell death. 
 
C1. Autophagy and cancer 
 
Much like the dual role that autophagy can play during nutrient deprivation or cell 
death, autophagy has been demonstrated to have dual roles in cancer, and therefore, the 
role autophagy plays in cancer appears to depend on context. Autophagy has been 
suggested to promote cell survival in the stressful, nutrient poor, and hypoxic conditions 
of tumors. Moreover, autophagy can serve as a protective mechanism by which tumor 
cells survive chemotherapy or radiation (Amaravadi et al., 2007; Degenhardt et al., 
2006). Conversely, autophagy has been suggested to have a tumor suppressive effect 
potentially through mechanisms such as degrading damaged mitochondria that produce 
reactive oxygen species that lead to DNA damage and tumor cell progression. Loss of 
autophagy has been shown to promote metabolic stress resulting in organelle damage, 
DNA damage, ER stress, elevated reactive oxygen species, and chromosomal instability; 
all of which are hallmarks of tumor cells and cancer progression  (Mathew et al., 2009; 
Mathew et al., 2007). The autophagy gene beclin-1 (Atg6) was shown to function as a 
haplioinsufficient tumor suppressor in mice, and allelic loss of beclin-1 has been seen in 
breast, ovarian and prostate cancers (Aita et al., 1999; Qu et al., 2003). In addition, it has 
been suggested that since the apoptotic machinery is frequently mutated in many cancers. 
Autophagy induction can be therapeutic by serving as an alternative mechanism to kill 

 
28 
 
cancer cells, and some drugs have been shown to induce autophagic cell death in cancer 
cell lines that lack the apoptotic machinery (Fazi et al., 2008; Shimizu et al., 2004). 
Clearly, the role autophagy can play in cancers depends greatly on contexts such as the 
type of cancer, the maturation of the disease, and the environment of the tumor. 
Therefore, understanding the regulations of autophagy in various contexts is extremely 
important, and can potentially lead to the improved understanding and treatment of 
cancer. 
 
C2. Autophagy and neurodegeneration 
 
A hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s, 
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Amytophic lateral sclerosis is the accumulation and 
aggregation of misfolded or damaged proteins resulting in organelle injury and the 
impairment of neurological function. Autophagy is one process by which cells remove 
damaged organelles and aggregated proteins, and manipulation of autophagy could 
potentially influence the progression of these diseases. For example, mice that had 
neuron-specific knockdown of autophagy showed an accumulation of inclusion bodies 
leading to neural loss and death (Hara et al., 2006; Komatsu et al., 2006; Pickford et al., 
2008). Moreover, cells isolated from patients with Alzheimer’s disease as well as samples 
from brains of Alzheimer’s patients have been shown to display defects in autophagy 
(Lee et al., 2010; Pickford et al., 2008). Therefore, understanding more about the 
regulation and mechanisms by which autophagy functions could help to modulate the 

 
29 
 
function of autophagy in specific contexts thereby potentially helping treat 
neurodegenerative diseases.  
 
Part IV: microRNAs 
microRNAs are approximately 22 nucleotide long non-coding RNAs that post-
transcriptionally regulate mRNA expression (Bartel, 2004). microRNAs can be 
transcribed in three different ways: first, as a primary transcript containing a single 
microRNA ; second, as a primary transcript containing a cluster of multiple microRNAs 
(called polycistronic microRNAs); third, as part of an intron of a mRNA (called a 
miRtron) (Cai et al., 2004; Rodriguez et al., 2004). In all cases these transcripts are 
processed through a few steps to obtain the mature microRNA.  
After transcription, similarly to mRNA processing, the transcript containing the 
microRNA is capped with a five-prime guanine and poly-adenylated. Within this 
transcript the microRNA exists in a hairpin-loop structure that contains imperfect base 
pairing that is processed out into an approximately 70 nucleotide precursor microRNA 
(pre-miRNA). If the microRNA is within a relatively small intron, the microRNA is 
processed by the spliceosome (Okamura et al., 2007; Ruby et al., 2007), and if from a 
primary transcript or a longer intron, the hairpin structure is processed out by a complex 
containing the RNase III enzyme Drosha, and the double stranded RNA-binding protein 
DGCR8 (Kim and Kim, 2007; Landthaler et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2003). This pre-miRNA 
is then exported from the nucleus in to the cytoplasm by the protein Exportin-5 (Yi et al., 

 
30 
 
2003), and further processed by another RNase II enzyme Dicer into an approximately 22 
nucleotide double stranded RNA duplex containing the microRNA (called a guide strand) 
imperfectly base paired with the micoRNA* (called a star strand or passenger strand) 
(Grishok et al., 2001; Hutvágner et al., 2001; Ketting et al., 2001; Knight & Bass, 2001). 
Due to its lower base pairing stability, the microRNA is selected by and loaded into the 
RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which is comprised of Dicer, TRBP, and the 
active RNase enzyme Ago2 to facilitate the binding of the microRNA to its target mRNA 
(Filipowicz, 2005; reviewed in Krol et al., 2010).  
Typically, microRNAs bind to the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of their target 
mRNA. To ensure targeting, perfect base pairing needs to occur in nucleotides two 
through eight of the microRNA; an area known as the seed region. Although base pairing 
of the remaining nucleotide of the microRNA to the mRNA does not need to occur to 
ensure regulation, the remainder of the microRNA can imperfectly pair with other 
nucleotide of the 3’ UTR. After binding to the mRNA, microRNAs can mediate gene 
silencing through deadenylation, repression, and mRNA decay. Typically, imperfect base 
pairing typically results in the blocking of translation or the destabilization of the mRNA 
whereas perfect base pairing of the entire microRNA to its target mRNA results in the 
cleavage of the mRNA (Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006; Eulalio et al., 2009; Reviewed in 
Fabian et al., 2010). Interestingly, recent findings indicate that microRNA regulation of 
gene activity can be more complex. Although translational repression is the most 
common form of regulation mediated by microRNAs, it has been demonstrated that this 
step is followed by mRNA deadenylation and decay (Béthune et al., 2012). For example, 

 
31 
 
in zebrafish, the microRNA miR-430 was shown to initially block translation before later 
inducing mRNA decay (Bazzini et al., 2012). Moreover, microRNA regulation of gene 
expression can be regulated by relieving microRNA repression through mechanisms such 
as inhibition of microRNA-mediated deadenylation (Kundu et al., 2012). 
microRNAs were first discovered in C. elegans as regulators of developmental 
timing (Lee et al., 1993). At the time, microRNAs had not been found in other animals, 
and therefore, not much attention was paid to them. However, later, microRNA genes 
were not only found in other species such as flies and mammals, but many microRNAs 
and the processes that they regulate have been shown to be conserved (Chen & 
Rajewsky, 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Peterson et al., 2009). Currently, according to 
miRbase.org, 2588 mature microRNAs have been annotated in human, and since their 
initial discovery, microRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of a vast number of 
cellular processes including programmed cell death (Xu et al., 2003), cell growth 
(Hipfner et al., 2002), muscle development (Sokol & Ambros, 2005; Zhao et al., 2007), 
and hormone signaling (Varghese & Cohen, 2009). Moreover, microRNA regulated 
processes and mis-regulation of microRNAs have been linked to a variety of diseases 
including cancer.    
 
A. microRNAs in Drosophila 
The powerful genetics and well understood biology make Drosophila an ideal 
organism in which to study microRNAs. Currently, 466 mature Drosophila micoRNAs 

 
32 
 
are listed in the microRNA database miRbase.org. Interestingly, a recent paper in which a 
collection of 95 mutants that deleted 130 microRNAs reported a correlation between 
microRNA abundance and phenotypes related to survival and lifespan. Moreover, they 
reported that most microRNA mutants had an observable phenotype indicating that many 
microRNAs must regulate important cellular processes. However, the regulatory 
mechanisms of these new mutants were not studied in great detail (Chen et al., 2014). In 
addition to these recent findings, microRNAs have been shown to regulate a variety of 
different cellular processes including caspase activity (Xu et al., 2003), cell growth 
(Hyun et al., 2009), sensory organ precursor production (Li et al., 2006), and intestinal 
homeostasis (Foronda et al., 2014). Therefore, it can be conceived that a large number of 
other cellular processes are regulated by microRNAs, but to determine the roles various 
microRNAs play in different contexts, more in depth studies ae required. 
Drosophila serves as a powerful model system with which microRNA regulation 
of cellular processes as well as microRNA biogenesis, biochemistry, and maturation can 
be studied. Additionally, Drosophila can be used as a model with which to study the role 
microRNAs can play in diseases. For example, researchers have developed Drosophila 
systems in which to model and study human diseases such as cancer and metastasis 
(Rudrapatna et al., 2012) and neurodegeneration (Lu & Vogel, 2009). Currently 34 
human disease models are readily available at the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center 
and therefore, these models can be used to test the roles microRNAs may play in various 
diseases. 

 
33 
 
 
B. microRNAs and disease 
microRNAs play critical roles in regulating developmental and homeostatic 
processes. One aspect of many human diseases is the deregulation of these processes. In 
many cancers, developmental programs that are normally regulated by microRNAs such 
as cell/tissue growth, division, and cell death are deregulated. In fact, many microRNAs 
have been shown to target oncogenic and tumor suppressive mRNAs (Chang et al., 2008; 
He et al., 2005; O'Donnell et al., 2005). microRNAs have also been observed to be 
deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Calin et al., 2002), and alterations in the 
microRNA processing machinery have been detected in some cancers resulting in a 
global change in the microRNA profile and mRNA regulation (Kuang et al., 2013; Lu et 
al., 2005; Melo et al., 2010; Merritt et al., 2008; Voller et al., 2013). 
The microRNA profile of various cancers can vary drastically (J. Lu et al., 2005). 
Each cancer can have a specific microRNA profile that is distinct from normal tissues. 
Therefore, the microRNA expression pattern of a tumor can serve as a diagnostic tool to 
help guide the treatment of the disease. Moreover, microRNAs that are circulating the in 
body fluids can be detected, and level changes in the circulating microRNAs can be 
indicative of various disease situations (Mitchell et al., 2008; Pritchard et al., 2012; 
Schwarzenbach et al., 2014). 
Hypothetically, if successfully delivered, microRNAs can be engineered to target 
any mRNA, and therefore, they can serve as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment 

 
34 
 
of many diseases.  Additionally, as microRNAs can themselves be dysregulated in some 
disease, anti-microRNAs agents could be engineered for microRNA down-regulation.   
 
Part V: Remaining thoughts regarding the regulation of autophagy and its roles in 
cell survival and cell death 
When approaching the problem of how cells die in a biological context, apoptosis 
is often the only form of cell death considered by investigators. However, autophagic cell 
death has been shown to play pivotal roles in the development of protists, insects, plants, 
and potentially mammals. Furthermore, autophagy plays a critical role in immune 
response-associated cell death of plants. Evidence for autophagic cell death in other 
organisms in these kingdoms exists. Therefore, the potential prominence of this form of 
cell death could be greatly under-estimated. 
It is safe to assume that when considering the biomass of the Earth, a large portion 
of the programmed cell death may occur though the utilization of autophagy. This is 
supported by the knowledge that plants and insects are dependent on autophagy for a 
large amount of cell death, and that taxa within these groups represent a large amount of 
biomass on Earth. It is important to note that plant crops and potentially a large number 
of pollinators likely rely on the use of autophagy during cell death. Additionally, parasitic 
protists such as certain trichomonads have been shown to undergo autophagic cell death 
(Mariante et al., 2006). Furthermore, autophagic cell death has been observed during the 
development of pests, such as disease transmitting mosquitoes (Fernandes et al., 2014). 

 
35 
 
Therefore, understanding the roles and regulation of autophagy during cell death not only 
can help crop health and growth, but may also help in the prevention infectious diseases. 
Evidence indicates that at least some of the mechanisms that regulate autophagic 
cell death are conserved between evolutionarily distant species (Lam et al., 2008). 
Furthermore, observations suggest that autophagic cell death occurs during development 
in higher metazoans such as mammals (Clarke, 1990). Thus, a better understanding of 
autophagic cell death in model organisms may help us understand autophagic cell death 
in humans. As the apoptotic machinery is often disrupted in diseases, such as cancer, 
autophagic cell death may offer an alternative mechanism to kill tumor cells. Future 
studies focused on understanding the regulation and function of autophagy in cell death 
could significantly advance science, agriculture, and the treatment of disease. 
 
Autophagy is a process that can be utilized to achieve two different cellular 
outcomes. In one outcome, autophagy is induced during a nutrient deprivation situation 
as a mechanism of cellular survival. In the other outcome, autophagy is induced as a 
mechanism to help achieve cellular death. Therefore, as the results of these outcomes are 
completely different, the question is: how do cells induce autophagy to achieve one of 
these fates while not the other? Could these cells be “primed” for one of these fates such 
that when autophagy is induced it goes down the correct path? If the cells are primed, 
how does this happen and how do they maintain this priming?  
 
To start to answer those questions a simplistic approach can be taken. By utilizing 
Drosophila as a model system, the regulatory differences between the utilization of 

 
36 
 
autophagy during nutrient deprivation versus programmed cell death can be tested. 
Namely, the regulation of autophagy in the nutrient-deprived fat body versus the 
degrading salivary glands can be compared. As described earlier, the fat body serves as 
the primary nutrient storage tissue for the larva, and therefore, it is primed to respond to 
nutrient signals to mobilize its energy stores during nutrient deprivation. The salivary 
glands, however, do not appear to be a nutrient storage tissue, and therefore, are probably 
not primed to induce autophagy during nutrient deprivation.  
Two ecdysone pulses are necessary for the degradation of the salivary glands. The 
first pulse occurs at puparium formation (Riddiford, 1993), and signals for the arrest of 
cellular growth;, a step that is necessary for gland destruction because cell growth 
directly inhibits the autophagic pathway. The second pulse peaks approximately 12 hours 
later, inducing autophagy and caspases (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; Martin & Baehrecke, 
2004). It is also known that the fat body responds to the 0 hour ecdysone pulse (Rusten et 
al., 2004). FlyAtlas tissue expression data indicate that the levels of the Ecdysone 
Receptor are higher in the salivary glands  (Chintapalli et al., 2007), and perhaps this 
difference in level influences the response pattern of each tissue. In addition, differences 
in the way the fat body and salivary gland cells respond to nutrient deprivation and/or the 
presence of other molecular factors may be instrumental in establishing this difference. 
As mentioned earlier, the engulfment receptor Draper is an example of a protein that is 
necessary for autophagy in the salivary gland but not the fat body (McPhee et al., 2010). 
Therefore, understanding the mechanism by which Draper regulates autophagy in the 
salivary glands can provide insight into the difference between these two tissues. 

 
37 
 
Unfortunately, it is unknown if Draper is directly induced by an ecdysone pulse, and the 
mechanism by which Draper regulates autophagy is unclear. 
The ability of salivary gland cells to properly respond to the ecdysone signals, and 
to coordinate cell growth arrest, autophagy and caspase inductions are crucial for gland 
destruction. Therefore, there must be tight regulation of these processes to allow for the 
proper timing of these developmental events. Interestingly, in Drosophila, microRNAs 
have been demonstrated to regulate hormone signaling, cell growth arrest, and caspase 
induction in other contexts (Bejarano et al., 2010; Hipfner et al., 2002; Hyun et al., 2009; 
Nolo et al., 2006; Thompson & Cohen, 2006; Varghese & Cohen, 2009; Varghese et al., 
2010; Xu et al., 2003).   
microRNAs can serve as a mechanism by which to buffer genetic noise and 
control genetic switches, and were discovered as prominent regulators of developmental 
timing (Herranz & Cohen, 2010; Lee et al., 1993). Additionally, microRNAs have been 
shown to regulate autophagy in vitro during nutrient deprivation of cultured cells 
(Frankel et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009). These connections of microRNAs with many of 
the cellular processes involved with salivary gland degradation as well as regulation of 
starvation-induced autophagy leaves us asking the question: could microRNAs be a 
regulatory mechanism that helps distinguish the use of autophagy during cell survival 
versus cell death?

Summary 
Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation process that has been implicated 
in age-associated diseases. Autophagy is involved in both cell survival and cell death, but 
little is known about the mechanisms that distinguish its use during these distinct cell 
fates. Here, we identify the microRNA, miR-14, as being both necessary and sufficient 
for autophagy during developmentally regulated cell death in Drosophila. Loss of miR-14 
prevented induction of autophagy during salivary gland cell death, but had no effect on 
starvation-induced autophagy in the fat body. Moreover, mis-expression of miR-14 was 
sufficient to prematurely induce autophagy in salivary glands, but not in the fat body. 

 
39 
 
Importantly, miR-14 regulates this context-specific autophagy through its target, inositol 
1,4,5-trisphosphate kinase 2 (ip3k2) thereby affecting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) 
signaling and calcium levels during salivary gland cell death. This study provides the first 
in vivo evidence of microRNA regulation of autophagy through modulation of IP3 
signaling. 
 
Introduction 
Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that delivers cytoplasmic materials, 
including proteins and organelles, to lysosomes for degradation (Mizushima & Komatsu, 
2011). Autophagy functions in multiple cellular contexts, including infection, stress, and 
cell death, and is involved in multiple age-associated disorders, such as cancer and 
neurodegeneration. During starvation, cells utilize autophagy to maintain nutrient 
homeostasis and for cell survival. Autophagy can also function in cell death, such as in 
the developmentally regulated death of larval salivary gland cells in Drosophila (Berry & 
Baehrecke, 2007). Although much is known about the mechanisms that control 
autophagy in response to nutrient deprivation, little is known about the regulation of 
autophagy during developmental cell death. 
microRNAs were first discovered as regulators of developmental timing; a 
process which appears to be conserved among metazoans (Ambros, 2011; Sokol, 2012). 
microRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that primarily function by down-regulating 
gene expression post-transcriptionally through base pairing to the 3’untranslated regions 

 
40 
 
(UTRs) of their target mRNAs. In Drosophila, microRNAs regulate multiple processes 
during development, including developmental timing, steroid hormone signaling, 
metabolism, and caspase activation (Brennecke et al., 2003; Caygill & Johnston, 2008; 
Varghese & Cohen, 2009; Varghese et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2003). The programmed 
degradation of larval salivary glands during Drosophila development requires the precise 
temporal regulation of hormone signaling, cell growth arrest, caspase activation, and 
autophagy (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; Jiang et al., 1997; Lee & Baehrecke, 2001; Martin 
& Baehrecke, 2004). However, no microRNAs have been previously shown to control 
the destruction of this tissue.  
microRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of autophagy (Frankel et al., 
2011; Zhu et al., 2009). However, all previous studies have focused on the regulation of 
autophagy by microRNAs during nutrient deprivation in derived cell lines, and no 
evidence exists that microRNAs regulate autophagy under physiological conditions in 
animals. In addition, microRNAs have not been shown to influence autophagy during cell 
death, and how microRNAs influence autophagy is poorly understood. 
Here we show that the microRNA, miR-14, is necessary for salivary gland 
degradation. While previous studies have shown that miR-14 can regulate hormone 
signaling and caspase activity in other contexts, we find that miR-14 does not influence 
either of these processes during salivary gland cell death.  Rather, we ascertain that miR-
14 regulates autophagy in dying salivary gland cells, and does so by targeting ip3k2, a 
gene that is involved in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) signaling and calcium release 

 
41 
 
from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We determine that IP3 signaling, as well as the 
calcium binding messenger protein, Calmodulin, are necessary for the induction of 
autophagy during salivary gland cell death. In addition, through its regulation of ip3k2, 
miR-14 is necessary for a rise in calcium levels coinciding with salivary gland death. 
Moreover, this regulation of autophagy by miR-14, IP3 signaling, and Calmodulin 
appears to be specific to the context of the developmental cell death of larval salivary 
glands, as starvation-induced autophagy in the larval fat body was not influenced by 
altered function of miR-14, ip3k2, IP3 signaling, or Calmodulin. 
 
Results 
miR-14 functions in salivary gland cell death 
The larval salivary glands of Drosophila undergo programmed cell death 14-16 
hours after puparium formation resulting in no visible gland remnants by 24 hours after 
puparium formation (described in Figures 2.1A and 2.1B).

Figure 2.1. A description of salivary gland degradation during development, and the 
cellular and gland fragments observed when degradation fails to occur. 
(A) A histological section (left) of a wild type animal 6 h after puparium formation 
approximately 8-10 hours before complete gland degradation. The left side of all 
images is the anterior end of the animal. The panel on the right shows the same image 
modified to emphasize the salivary glands. 
(B) A histological section (left) of a wild type animal 12 h after puparium formation 
approximately 2-4 hours before complete gland degradation. The panel on the right 
shows the same image modified to emphasize the salivary glands. 
(C) A histological section (left) 24 h after puparium formation. Normally, animals at this 
time have degraded their salivary glands, and no material can be observed. However, 
this animal has only partially, but not completely, degraded its salivary glands thereby 
displaying a “cellular fragment” phenotype (fkh-GAL4/w; +/UAS-droshaIR). Labeled 
are the head (left part of the animal), thorax (middle part of the animal), abdomen 
(right part of the animal), the brain (blue stained tissue), fat body cells (brown and red 
stained cells), and developing legs. The panel on the right shows the same image 
modified to emphasize the cellular fragments. Note these cellular fragments have 
remained 10 h after they should have been degraded. 
(D) A histological section (left) 24 h after puparium formation of an animal failed to 
degrade its salivary glands. In this animal, no partial degradation has occurred (as 
seen in (C)). Therefore, this animals is displaying a salivary “gland fragment” 
phenotype (w; miR-14Δ1/miR-14Δ1; UAS-p35/fkh-GAL4). The panel on the right 

 
43 
 
shows the same image modified to emphasize the gland fragments. Note these gland 
fragments have remained 10 h after they should have been degraded. 
 

 
44 
 
To determine if micoRNAs play a role in regulating salivary gland cell death, we 
inhibited the production of microRNAs in the salivary gland by knocking down the 
microRNA processing factors drosha or dicer-1 via salivary gland-specific RNAi.  At 24 
hours after puparium formation, histological analyses revealed that salivary gland cell 
fragments persisted in animals expressing a double-stranded inverse repeat construct 
designed to target either drosha (droshaIR) or dicer-1 (dicer-1IR), but no residual salivary 
gland material was observed in control animals at the same stage indicating that the 
microRNA processing machinery are necessary for salivary gland clearance (Figures 
2.2A-2.2D; emphasized in Figure 2.1C). 
We then determined the profile of microRNAs expressed in dying salivary glands 
(Table 2.1), and screened 11 available mutants of gland-expressed microRNA genes for 
defects in salivary gland clearance. One null mutant, miR-14Δ1, displayed a strong failure 
in salivary gland clearance (Figures 2.2E and 2.2F). In addition, expression of miR-14 
specifically in salivary glands of homozygous miR-14 Δ1 mutant animals rescued the 
degradation defect in this tissue (Figures 2.2E and 2.2F). Additionally, expression of 
droshaIR in the salivary glands of homozygous miR-14 mutant animals failed to enhance 
the phenotype observed in miR-14 mutant animals alone (Figures 2.2G and 2.2H). 
Interestingly, the passenger strand of miR-14 has been shown to be loaded into the 
Argonaut-2 complex which ordinarily loads small-inhibitory RNAs and carries out RNA 
interference (Czech et al., 2009). Therefore, we sought to determine if the clearance 
defect observed in miR-14 mutant animals involved this complex. Argonaut-2 mutant 
animals showed no defects in salivary gland clearance (data not shown). These results 

 
45 
 
indicate that miR-14 is required for salivary gland clearance, that miR-14 functions in a 
salivary gland autonomous manner, and if other microRNAs are required for clearance, 
they function in the same genetic pathway as miR-14. Moreover, these results indicate 
that the Argonaut-2 complex is not necessary for salivary gland clearance, miR-14’s 
function in the salivary glands does not occur through its passenger strand, and therefore 
likely reflect the activity of miR-14 occurs through its guide strand  in regulating salivary 
gland degradationS.

Table 2.1. microRNA levels in the salivary gland before and during cell death. 
Total RNA was extracted from dissected wild type (Canton S) salivary glands staged at 6, 
8, 10, 12 and 14 h after puparium formation. TaqMan was used to profile 77 microRNAs 
for presence in the salivary gland. ΔCT was normalized to 2s RNA and is listed for each 
microRNA that was profiled at each time point.

miR-14 does not regulate hormone signaling, cell growth arrest, or caspase 
activation during salivary gland cell death 
Failure of salivary gland cell growth arrest results in attenuation of autophagy and 
incomplete salivary gland degradation (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007). Therefore, we tested 
if loss of miR-14 influences salivary gland cell growth arrest by using the tGPH reporter 
for phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3 (PIP3) activity (Britton et al., 2002) , and by measuring 
cell area. We observed neither a difference in tGPH localization nor an increase cell area 
in control and miR-14 mutant salivary glands (Figures 2.3A and 2.3B). These data 
indicate that the salivary gland degradation defect in miR-14 mutant animals is not an 
indirect consequence of a defect in cell growth arrest.  
Salivary gland cell death is triggered by a developmental rise in the steroid 
hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (ecdysone) (Jiang et al., 1997). The Ecdysone Receptor 
(EcR) and its partner ultraspiracle (USP) then directly induce the transcription of multiple 
target genes including Broad Complex (BrC) leading to the degradation of the larval 
salivary glands (Gauhar et al., 2009). A previous study indicated that miR-14 can 
influence EcR levels based on analyses of whole pupae 24 hours after puparium 
formation (Varghese & Cohen, 2009). Therefore, we tested if loss of miR-14 influenced 
EcR and BrC levels during salivary gland death. To our surprise, neither EcR nor BrC 
protein levels were significantly altered in salivary glands by loss of miR-14 (Figure 
2.3C). These data indicate that the salivary gland clearance defect that is observed in 

 
51 
 
miR-14 mutant animals is not due to miR-14 regulation of either EcR or altered steroid 
signaling. 
 
Caspase activity and autophagy are both required for salivary gland degradation, 
and these two processes appear to function independently of each other (Berry & 
Baehrecke, 2007). Thus, when either autophagy or caspases are inhibited, partial 
degradation of the salivary glands occurs resulting in a weaker degradation phenotype 
consisting of diffuse fragments of cellular material that we define as cell fragments. By 
contrast, when caspases and autophagy are inhibited simultaneously, more intact tissue 
fragments in the shape of the two oval salivary glands persist resulting in a stronger 
phenotype that we define as gland fragments (described in Figures 2.1C and 2.1D) (Berry 
& Baehrecke, 2007). In miR-14 homozygous mutant animals, we observed a weaker 
phenotype with dispersed cellular fragments (Figures 2.2E and 2.2F), suggesting that 
miR-14 regulates either autophagy or caspase activity but not both. 
Since miR-14 was first identified as a genetic suppressor of apoptosis (Xu et al., 
2003), we examined the relationship between caspases and miR-14 in dying salivary 
glands. We expressed the caspase inhibitor p35 in the salivary glands of control and miR-
14 homozygous mutant animals. While the weaker phenotype of salivary gland cell 
fragments were observed in control animals of either p35-expressing or miR-14 mutant 
alone, we observed a distinctly stronger phenotype of two large oval-shaped salivary 
gland tissue fragments in miR-14 mutant animals that also expressed p35 (Figures 2.3D 
and 2.3E; emphasized in Figure 2.1D). This enhancement of the salivary gland clearance

defect indicates that miR-14 functions in an additive manner with the caspase pathway. In 
support of this conclusion, miR-14 mutant and control salivary glands also exhibited no 
clear difference in either the timing or amount of cleaved Caspase-3 immuno-
fluorescence (Figures 2.3F and 2.3G). Taken together, these data indicate that loss of 
miR-14 does not influence caspases in dying salivary glands.

miR-14 is necessary and sufficient for autophagy during salivary gland cell death 
Autophagy causes a reduction in cell size (Chang et al., 2013), and miR-14 mutant 
salivary gland cells failed to shrink as much as control cells (Figure 2.3B) suggesting that 
autophagy may be defective in miR-14 mutant salivary glands. To determine whether 
autophagy is involved in miR-14 regulation of salivary gland cell death, we inhibited 
autophagy by knockdown of the autophagy gene Atg6 in miR-14 mutant animals. We 
observed no clear differences in the cell fragment phenotypes of miR-14 homozygous 
mutant animals whether or not Atg6IR was expressed in salivary glands (Figures 2.4A and 
2.4B). These data suggest that miR-14 functions in the same pathway as Atg6, and, 
therefore, regulates salivary gland cell death by autophagy. Consistent with this 
interpretation, homozygous miR-14 mutant salivary glands possess significantly fewer 
mCherry-Atg8a autophagy reporter puncta compared to heterozygous control salivary 
glands (Figures 2.4C and 2.4D). To determine if miR-14 is a general regulator of 
autophagy, we tested if this miRNA is required for starvation-induced autophagy in the 
larval fat body. In contrast to salivary gland cell death, we observed no difference in the 
amounts of mCherry-Atg8a autophagy reporter puncta in the fat bodies of control versus 
homozygous miR-14 mutant animals following four hours of nutrient deprivation 
(Figures 2.4E and 2.4F). This indicates that miR-14 is necessary for developmentally 
regulated autophagy in the salivary gland, but is dispensable for starvation-induced fat 
body autophagy.  

 
56 
 
We next tested if miR-14 is sufficient for autophagy. We observed that cell 
autonomous mis-expression of miR-14 was sufficient to induce premature mCherry-
Atg8a puncta in the salivary glands of third instar larvae (Figure 2.4G), but was not 
sufficient to induce autophagy reporter puncta in larval fat body (Figure 2.4H). To ensure 
that this tissue specific induction of autophagy was in fact because of mis-expression of 
miR-14, we repeated this experiment with a second miR-14 transgenic line. Once again, 
autophagy was induced in the salivary gland, but not the fat body (Figure 2.5). Thus, 
miR-14 functions to regulate autophagy during developmental salivary gland cell death, 
but is not involved in nutrient deprivation-induced autophagy. The observation that mis-
expression of miR-14 resulted in autophagy occurring at an earlier developmental stage 
than in wild type (Figure 2.4G) suggests that during wild type development, miR-14 
levels may be limiting at earlier stages.

miR-14 targets the ip3k2 gene to regulate autophagy during salivary gland cell death 
Our next goal was to identify targets of miR-14 that influence autophagy. We 
hypothesized that knockdown of miR-14 targets would result in phenotypes that are 
similar to those induced by mis-expression of miR-14. Knockdown of either EcR or 
sugarbabe, two previously-identified targets of miR-14 (Varghese & Cohen, 2009; 
Varghese et al., 2010), failed to induce mCherry-Atg8a autophagy reporter puncta in the 
salivary glands (Table 2.2). Therefore, we used the microRNA binding site prediction 
programs Pictar and Targetscan to identify candidate mir-14 target genes, and then used 
RNAi lines against these candidate targets to screen for the induction of mCherry-Atg8a 
autophagy reporter puncta (Table 2.2).

autophagy.

RNAi lines screened for clonal induction of pmCherry-Atg8a puncta in wandering larval 
salivary gland cells, but not in feeding larval fat body cells to identify a potential target of 
miR-14 regulation. RNAi lines were crossed with hsflp; pmCherry-Atga8a; act<FRT, 
cd2, FRT>Gal4, UAS-GFP. Listed are the genes’ names, the RNAi line used, and if there 
was observed induction of autophagy in the salivary gland (SG) and/or the fat body (FB). 
(-) denotes no induction. (+) denotes induction. n/a denotes not assessed because no 
induction was observed in the salivary gland.

Of the 31 genes tested, knock down of two genes, Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and 
Cdk12 resulted in the induction of autophagy in both the salivary glands and fat body. 
Only knockdown of ip3k2 resulted in the tissue-specific induction of mCherry-Atg8a 
autophagy reporter puncta in salivary glands, and not in fat body (Figures 2.6A and 
2.6B). To ensure that the phenotype observed was not due to an off target effect of the 
RNAi, we tested two more RNAi lines that targeted different sequences of ip3k2. 
Interestingly, one RNAi line that specifically targeted isoforms A and B failed to induce 
mCherry-Atg8a reporter puncta (Figure 2.6C) whereas expression of either a RNAi line 
that targeted all known isoforms or specifically isoforms C, D and H were able to display 
the same phenotype as mis-expression of miR-14 (Figures 2.6A, 2.6B, 2.6D and 2.6E). 
These results suggest that ip3k2 is a potential target of miR-14 in its regulation of 
autophagy specifically in the salivary glands, and that isoforms C, D and H are 
responsible for this regulation while isoforms A and B appear dispensable. Moreover, 
these results do not exclude the possibility that Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and Cdk12 are 
additional targets of miR-14 that regulate autophagy in both the salivary gland and fat 
body but are targeted by miR-14 only in the salivary gland.

As knockdown of ip3k2’s isoforms C, D and H but not isoforms A and B was 
sufficient to induce autophagy in the salivary glands, we hypothesized that over-
expression of isoforms C, D and H would inhibit salivary gland degradation. It should 
be noted that isoforms A and B are annotated to make identical proteins only differing 
in their 5’ UTRs (shown in Figure 2.8A), and that isoforms C, D and H are annotated 
to make identical proteins only differing in both UTRs (shown in Figure 2.8A); all 
isoforms of ip3k2 contain a predicted miR-14 binding site in their 3’ UTRs. When 
isoforms A and B were over-expressed specifically in the salivary glands, we 
observed no defect in gland clearance compared to control animals (Figures 2.7A and 
2.7B). However, when isoforms C, D and H were over-expressed specifically in the 
salivary glands, we observed a significant amount of animals with persistent salivary 
gland material (Figures 2.7C and 2.7D). Moreover, over-expression of isoforms C, D 
and H was sufficient to prevent the induction of autophagy in salivary glands 14 
hours after puparium formation (Figures 2.7E and 2.7F). Put together, these data 
indicate that expression of isoforms C, D and H, but not A and B is sufficient to 
prevent the induction of autophagy that is necessary for salivary gland degradation.

To further validate ip3k2 as a target of miR-14 by genetic epistasis, we created a 
loss-of- function mutant, ip3k2Δ1 (see Experimental Procedures) that lacks most of the 
ip3k2 gene, including the conserved inositol polyphosphate kinase (IPK) domain (Figure 
2.8). When we combined the ip3k2 and miR-14 mutants we observed a significant 
suppression of the miR-14 salivary gland clearance phenotype (Figures 2.9A and 2.9B). 
Furthermore, the ip3k2 mutation suppressed the miR-14 mutant salivary gland autophagy 
phenotype based on restoration of the number of mCherry-Atg8a autophagy reporter 
puncta (Figures 2.9C and 2.9D). Moreover, in miR-14 mutant animals, we did not 
observe dominant suppression of the gland clearance phenotype nor restoration of 
mCherry-Atg8s puncta when animals were also heterozygous for the ip3k2 mutation. In 
addition, the ip3k2 mutant showed no difference in the number of mCherry-Atg8a puncta 
in fat bodies of either fed or nutrient deprived larvae (Figure 2.10). Interestingly, we 
observed that deletion of ip3k2 was sufficient to suppress the gland clearance phenotype 
observed when drosha was knocked down specifically in the salivary glands (Figure 
2.11). These data indicate that ip3k2 functions genetically downstream of miR-14 in the 
regulation of autophagy during salivary gland cell death, and that if other microRNAs 
regulate gland degradation, they appear to function upstream of and in the same pathway 
as ip3k2.

To investigate if ip3k2 3’ UTR sequences can mediate regulation by miR-14, we 
constructed in vivo green fluorescent protein (GFP) sensors. In these constructs, the 3’ 
UTR of ip3k2 was fused to GFP creating a wild type control sensor, and a similar sensor 
was created with mutations in the predicted miR-14 binding site (Figure 2.12A). 
Transgenic flies were generated containing either the wild type or mutant 3’ UTR 
constructs (Groth et al., 2004), and sensor levels were analyzed in control and miR-14 
mutant salivary glands by immuno-blot. With the wild type sensor, we observed a 
significant elevation of GFP protein in the salivary glands of homozygous miR-14 mutant 
animals compared to the salivary glands of control animals (Figures 2.12B and 2.12C). 
Moreover, salivary gland GFP expression from the sensor containing the mutant miR-14 
binding site was increased in control animals, and was identical to the GFP levels in 
homozygous miR-14 mutant animals (Figures 2.12B and 2.12C). These data support the 
conclusion that ip3k2 is a bona fide direct target of miR-14 that regulates autophagy 
during cell death of salivary glands.

IP3 signaling and Calmodulin are necessary for autophagy during salivary gland 
death 
We next sought to determine how ip3k2 regulates autophagy during salivary 
gland death. ip3k2 contains a highly conserved IPK domain (Figure 2.8B) that is known 
to phosphorylate IP3 to form inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) (Seeds et al., 2004). 
IP3 can serve as a cytoplasmic second messenger molecule that stimulates calcium 
release by binding the IP3-receptor, an ER localized calcium ion channel (Berridge et al., 
2000).  
We hypothesized that in miR-14 mutant animals, IP3K2 levels are elevated 
resulting in low levels of IP3. To determine if IP3 signaling plays a role in salivary gland 
degradation, we expressed an IP3 sponge specifically in the salivary glands. This IP3 
sponge contains multiple IP3 binding motifs that bind to IP3 and decrease its availability 
(Usui-Aoki et al., 2005). At 24 hours after puparium formation, the number of animals 
with persistent salivary gland cell fragments was increased in animals that expressed the 
IP3 sponge compared to control animals at the same stage (Figures 2.13A and 2.13B). In 
addition, expression of the IP3 sponge in salivary glands inhibited the induction of 
autophagy based on the number of mCherry-Atg8a puncta compared to controls (Figures 
2.13C and 2.13D). Importantly, when the IP3 sponge was expressed in ip3k2 mutant 
animals, we still observed the persistence of salivary gland cell fragments (Figures 2.13E 
and 2.13F) and low levels of mCherry-Atg8a puncta compared to controls (Figures 2.13G 
and 2.13H).

To complement our analyses of IP3 sponge expression, we also utilized RNAi to 
knock down the ip3-receptor specifically in the salivary glands. Similar to animals that 
express the IP3 sponge, animals with knockdown of the ip3-receptor in salivary glands 
possessed persistent salivary gland cell fragments (Figures 2.14A and 2.14B), and had 
significantly attenuated mCherry-Atg8a puncta compared to controls (Figures 2.14C and 
2.14D). Furthermore, when the ip3-receptor was knocked down in ip3k2 mutant animals, 
we still observed the persistence of salivary gland cell fragments (Figures 2.14E and 
2.14F), and reduced mCherry-Atg8a puncta relative to controls (Figures 2.14G and 
2.14H). However, when either the IP3 sponge was expressed or the ip3-receptor was 
knocked down with RNAi in the fat body of animals following nutrient deprivation, we 
observed no difference in the number of mCherry-Atg8a puncta compared to control cells 
(Figure 2.15). These data indicate that IP3 signaling through the IP3-receptor is necessary 
for autophagy and degradation during salivary gland cell death, but are dispensable for 
autophagy during nutrient deprivation of the fat body.

We hypothesized that IP3 regulates autophagy through calcium signaling during 
salivary gland cell death. To test our hypothesis, we used RNAi to decrease the function 
of the Calmodulin gene, which encodes a calcium-binding messenger protein. When 
Calmodulin was knocked down specifically in salivary glands we observed persistence of 
salivary gland cell fragments (Figures 2.16A and 2.16B), and decreased mCherry-Atg8a 
autophagy reporter puncta (Figures 2.16C and 2.16D). In addition, when Calmodulin was 
knocked-down specifically in the salivary glands of ip3k2 mutant animals, the salivary 
gland cell fragments persisted (Figures 2.16E and 2.16F) and mCherry-Atg8a puncta 
were attenuated (Figures 2.16G and 2.16H). However, when Calmodulin was knocked 
down by RNAi in the fat body of nutrient deprived larvae, we observed no difference in 
the number of mCherry-Atg8a puncta compared to control cells (Figure 2.17) indicating 
that Calmodulin is dispensable for autophagy during nutrient deprivation. Combined, 
these data indicate that Calmodulin functions downstream of IP3K2 in the regulation of 
autophagy during salivary gland cell death.

Next, we tested if IP3 signaling functioned downstream of miR-14 as indicated by 
our previous experiments. When the ip3-receptor was knocked down simultaneously 
with mis-expression of miR-14 in the salivary glands, we did not observe the premature 
increase in mCherry-Atg8a puncta characteristic of mir-14 misexpression alone (Figure 
2.18). These data indicate that knockdown of the ip3-receptor is sufficient to suppress the 
induction of autophagy that is triggered by mis-expression of miR-14, and functions 
downstream of miR-14.

miR-14 and ip3k2 influence calcium levels in the salivary gland 
We hypothesized that miR-14 regulation of ip3k2 mediates release of calcium 
during salivary gland destruction. Therefore, we sought to determine if miR-14 and ip3k2 
influence calcium levels in the salivary gland using the calcium indicator, GCaMP 
(Akerboom et al., 2012). Perturbations, such as dissection of the salivary gland, resulted 
in a rapid release of calcium. Therefore, we live-imaged salivary glands expressing 
GCaMP in intact animals. In control animals, an increase in the GCaMP signal was 
observed at eight hours after puparium formation coinciding with the rise in ecdysone 
that triggers salivary gland destruction (Figure 2.19). In miR-14 mutant animals, the 
GCaMP signal was lower at all stages compared to control animals, including no marked 
increase at eight hours after puparium formation (Figures 2.19A and 2.19B). 
Additionally, ip3k2 mutant animals exhibited a significant premature elevation in the 
GCaMP signal compared to control animals (Figures 2.19C and 2.19D). These data 
indicate that release of calcium precedes salivary gland death, miR-14 is necessary for 
this release of calcium, and loss of ip3k2 results in premature elevation of calcium.

Discussion 
While much is known about the regulation of autophagy during nutrient 
deprivation, relatively little is understood about the regulation of autophagy in the context 
of programmed cell death. Our findings reveal a mechanism involving the regulation of 
ip3k2 by the microRNA miR-14. In turn, these factors influence IP3 signaling and 
Calmodulin as a mechanism that distinguishes between the utilization of autophagy 
during programmed cell death from the use of autophagy in the context of cellular stress. 
Previous studies have linked microRNAs and autophagy. For example, autophagy 
can modulate the intracellular levels of microRNAs by degradation of core microRNA 
machinery (Gibbings et al., 2012; Zhang & Zhang, 2013). In addition, multiple studies 
have shown that over-expression of microRNAs can be sufficient to inhibit autophagy in 
cell lines under starvation conditions (Frankel et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009). By contrast, 
our findings demonstrate that the microRNA, miR-14, is both necessary and sufficient for 
autophagy during developmental cell death in an animal, but that miR-14 has no apparent 
effect on autophagy triggered by nutrient deprivation. While miR-14 is expressed in the 
fat body (Varghese et al., 2010), it appears not to matter if miR-14 regulates ip3k2 in this 
tissue, as IP3 signaling and Calmodulin appear to play no detectable role in regulating 
autophagy during nutrient deprivation. 
Interestingly, steroid signaling and caspase activity are both necessary for salivary 
gland cell death, and in other contexts, these two processes have been shown to be 
regulated by miR-14 (Varghese & Cohen, 2009; Varghese et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2003). 

 
93 
 
However, during salivary gland cell death, neither of these processes was affected by loss 
of miR-14. This new role of miR-14 in promoting organ-specific developmental 
autophagy underscores the context-specific roles that microRNAs can play.  
Our findings show that miR-14 controls this context-specific autophagy in dying 
salivary gland cells by targeting the IP3-kinase ip3k2. Although the percentage of 
animals with a defect in salivary gland clearance appears less severe in animals with 
compromised IP3/calcium signaling compared to miR-14 mutant animals, this is most 
likely due to RNAi knockdown and IP3 sponge expression efficiencies. In addition, in all 
histological analyses of salivary gland clearance, there is an inherent range of salivary 
gland material appearance and size. For example, cellular fragments are detached from 
each other and therefore fluid. Thus, two dimensional histological sections do not always 
convey the best representation of salivary gland material in an animal.  
Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that a microRNA and its target can both be 
present in two distinct cell types, but the microRNA only regulates the expression of the 
target in one of these cells (Mishima et al., 2006). Therefore, it cannot be excluded that 
other miR-14 targets regulate autophagy in both the fat body and salivary glands, but 
miR-14 only regulates these targets in the salivary gland. In this scenario, mis-expression 
of miR-14 would display salivary gland-specific induction of autophagy whereas RNAi 
knockdown of the target would induce autophagy in both the fat body and salivary 
glands.  As such, the potential targets identified in the RNAi screen (Table 2.2), Aspartyl-
tRNA synthetase and Cdk12, could be regulated by miR-14 specifically in the salivary 

 
94 
 
glands while still possessing the ability to influence autophagy in other contexts such as 
during nutrient deprivation. 
To the best of our knowledge, no IP3-kinase has previously been implicated in the 
control of autophagy. Our data indicate that ip3k2 regulates autophagy through IP3 
signaling, by inducing the release of calcium, thereby affecting Calmodulin activity. Our 
findings imply that calcium-bound Calmodulin activity should result in the induction of 
autophagy, potentially through the modulation of proteins such as Calmodulin-dependent 
kinases and/or Atg proteins. A previous study demonstrated that Calmodulin can bind 
IP3K2 in vitro, and that this calcium-dependent binding increased the ability of IP3K2 to 
remove IP3 (Lloyd-Burton et al., 2007). It is possible that before the signal for salivary 
gland degradation, this connection between IP3K2 and Calmodulin results in a feedback 
loop to buffer calcium levels, and only after ecdysone signals for gland degradation does 
miR-14 repress IP3K2 thereby elevating cytoplasmic calcium levels leading to the 
induction of autophagy. 

 
95 
 
 
Our data indicate that only isoforms C, D and H but not isoforms A and B affect 
autophagy in the salivary glands. Possibly the difference in protein sequence/structure of 
these isoforms allow for the specific interaction(s) with other proteins such as 
Calmodulin that modulate the activity and/or cellular localization of IP3K2 thereby 
influencing the involvement that IP3K2 has with autophagy in the salivary gland. The 
protein sequence that is different between these isoforms is not conserved suggesting that 
this isoform difference in control of autophagy is Drosophila specific. It also cannot be 
ruled out that knockdown and mis-expression of isoforms A/B was not strong enough for 
a phenotype to manifest. 
Interestingly, ip3k1 is also a predicted target of miR-14, but we observed no 
influence of this gene on autophagy in the salivary gland using two independent RNAi 
lines that target distinct sequences (Table 2.2) (Terhzaz et al., 2010). Additionally, 
heterozygous loss of ip3k1 failed to suppress the miR-14 salivary gland clearance defect 
(data not shown), suggesting that ip3k1 is not involved in the regulation of autophagy 
during salivary gland death. Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated that Calmodulin 
cannot bind IP3K1 in vitro (Lloyd-Burton et al., 2007), and it may be this lack of 
interaction that ensures that IP3K1 does not regulate autophagy during salivary gland 
destruction. 
Although multiple studies have linked calcium signaling to autophagy (Decuypere 
et al., 2011), the manner, either positive or negative, in which calcium influences 
autophagy seems to depend on context. Since it has been shown that a rise in free Ca2+ 

 
96 
 
can induce autophagy via mTOR inhibition (Høyer-Hansen et al., 2007), it is possible 
that the mTOR pathway could contribute to the effect of miR-14 on autophagy induction. 
However, we have previously shown that that modulation of mTOR pathway influences 
both cell size and tGPH reporter localization (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007). Since neither 
cell size nor tGPH reporter were affected in mir-14 mutant salivary glands (Figure 2A 
and 2B), it appears unlikely that mTOR activity is appreciably altered by loss of mir-14.  
Finally, we cannot exclude that ip3k2 could also regulate autophagy in an IP3- 
and/or calcium-independent manner. For example, the mammalian Beclin1 (Atg6) 
complex has been shown to bind the ER localized IP3-receptor through the protein NAF-
1 (N. C. Chang et al., 2010). Therefore, it is possible that IP3 signaling may serve as a 
mechanism to relocate the Beclin1 complex to the ER so that the ER can function as a 
membrane source for autophagosomes. Additionally, calcium signaling may cooperate 
with localization of the Beclin1 complex to the ER to achieve complete induction of 
autophagy during salivary gland cell death. Future studies should resolve how miR-14 
and its target, the novel autophagy factor ip3k2, and IP3 signaling regulate autophagy.

Experimental Procedures 
Drosophila strains  
The Canton-S strain was used as the wild-type control. miR-14Δ1(Xu et al., 2003), 
miR-9ae39 and miR-9aj22 (Li et al., 2006), miR-8 Δ2 (Karres et al., 2007), miR-7 Δ1 (X. Li & 
Carthew, 2005), let-7KO.C (Caygill & Johnston, 2008), let-7K01 and let-7GKI (Sokol et al., 
2008), miR-278KO (Teleman et al., 2006), miR-279S0962-7 and miR-279Δ0.8 (Cayirlioglu et 
al., 2008), pWiz-droshaIR#2 (from P. Zamore) and UAS-dicer-1IR (Bloomington 
Drosophila stock center line 28598) were used for analyses of microRNA function. The 
following Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center (VDRC) stocks were used: UAS-Atg6IR 
VDRC Transformant ID (Llimargas et al.) 22122, UAS-ip3k2IR VDRC TID 102772, 
UAS-ip3k2IR VDRC TID 19159. The sequences used for VDRC knock-down strains are 
available for each TID at http://stockcenter.vdrc.at/control/main. For mis-expression 
studies, we used UAS-miR-14 (Xu et al., 2003), UAS-luciferase-miR-14 (Bloomington 
Drosophila stock center line 41178) and UAS-p35 (Hay et al., 1994). For clonal mis-
expression and RNAi studies we used hsflp; +; act<FRT, cd2, FRT>Gal4, UAS-GFP 
(Bloomington Drosophila stock center). All RNAi lines used to screen for targets of miR-
14 are listed in Supplementary Table 2. pmCherry-Atg8a was used as a marker of 
autophagy (Denton et al., 2012), and tGPH was used as a reporter of 

 
98 
 
phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-P3 (Britton et al., 2002). For overexpression of ip3k2 
isoforms A/B we used UAS-ip3k2 (Terhzaz et al.). The UAS-ip3k2 isoforms C/D/H and 
the ip3k2 mutant allele ip3k2Δ1 were created for this paper. tub-eGFP-ip3k2 wild type 
3’UTR and tub-eGFP-ip3k2 mutated 3’UTR lines were used as sensors for regulation of 
the ip3k2 3’UTR by miR-14 and created for this paper. UAS-IP3-spongeM49 (Usui-Aoki 
et al., 2005), UAS-ip3-receptorIR (VDRC TID 106982), and UAS-calmodulinIR 
(Bloomington Drosophila stock center line 34609) were used for analysis of IP3 
signaling and Calmodulin. UAS-GCaMP5 strains were used for live-imaging of calcium 
(Bloomington Drosophila stock center lines 42037 and 42038).  
 
ip3k2Δ1 mutant  
 
The ip3k2Δ1 deletion allele was created by flippase mediated site specific 
recombination of the lines PBac{RB}IP3K2e02492 (Bloomington Drosophila stock center 
18060) and P{RS3}CB-0529-3 (Drosophila Genetic Resource Center line number 
123222), resulting in a 10,540 base pair deletion from genomic locations X:13,213,313 to 
13,223,853 while leaving a 2,241 base pair hybrid PBac{RB}/P{RS3} element, and was 
subsequently out crossed three times to wild-type strain. The deletion was validated by

Immunolabeling and Microscopy 
For immunohistochemisty, salivary glands were dissected from animals kept at 
25ºC, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4ºC, blocked in PBS, 1% BSA 
and 0.1% tween (PBSBT), and incubated with rabbit anti-cleaved-Caspase-3 (1:400) 
(Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4ºC. Salivary glands were washed for two hours 
at room temperature in PBSBT, incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for two 
hours at room temperature, and washed for one hour in PBSBT. Salivary glands were 
mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For mCherry-Atg8a, tGPH and cell size 
analyses, salivary glands were dissected from animals staged at 25ºC, fixed in 2% PFA 
containing 2μM Hoechst stain for two minutes at room temperature, washed in PBS, and 
mounted in PBS. Cell size was measured using Zeiss measure software. mCherry-Atg8a

using ImageJ software. All imaging except GCaMP was performed on a Zeiss Axiophot 
II microscope. GCaMP imaging was performed on a Zeiss two-photon microscope, LSM 
7 MP. During all quantifications, the images that were used were unaltered. In all 

 
102 
 
mCherry-Atg8a and cleaved-Caspase-3 figures, the brightness, contrast, and gamma were 
altered separately from the DNA to better emphasize puncta.

CHAPTER III 
Conclusions and future directions 
 
Part I: Autophagy during cell survival and death 
 
It is fascinating that autophagy can be utilized to achieve two opposite cellular 
outcomes. We have taken advantage of Drosophila melanogaster as a model system to 
study the utilization of autophagy during both the cell survival of the larval fat body as 
well as developmental cell death of the salivary glands. This approach has enabled us to 
begin to better understand the regulatory difference between the uses of autophagy in 
these different contexts. 
 
A. Nutrient sensing 
Compared with the salivary gland, the knowledge of the regulation of autophagy 
during fat body starvation is relatively well understood. As expected, many of the core 
autophagy components have been demonstrated to be necessary for autophagy during fat 
body starvation (Chang & Neufeld, 2009; Juhász et al., 2007; Juhász et al., 2008; Scott et 
al., 2007; Scott et al., 2004), and many of the mechanisms by which autophagy is 
regulated during nutrient deprivation are also understood (Kim et al., 2008; Li et al., 
2010; Scott et al., 2004). In the fat body, PI3K, AMPK and mTOR signaling play pivotal 
roles in nutrient sensing and the regulation of autophagy, and mTOR has been shown to 
directly modulate the activity of the Atg1 complex in a nutrient-dependent manner 

 
104 
 
(Chang & Neufeld, 2009; Scott et al., 2007). Despite the extensive knowledge of the 
regulation of autophagy in the fat body during nutrient deprivation, we do not completely 
understand the regulation of autophagy in this context. Other signaling pathways most 
likely influence various aspects of autophagy such as induction, flux, and intensity in 
order to ensure its efficient use as a survival mechanism. For example, the hedgehog 
pathway was shown to be necessary for the induction of autophagy in the nutrient-
deprived fat body (Jimenez-Sanchez et al., 2012). However, the mechanism by which the 
hedgehog pathway regulates autophagy is unclear. Regardless, this novel connection 
between a well-known signaling pathway and autophagy induction during nutrient 
deprivation demonstrates the complexity of regulation that exists. 
 
How autophagy is regulated in the salivary glands is less understood. Unlike the 
fat body, autophagy induction relies on hormone signaling rather than nutrient sensing. 
We know that two pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone are necessary for the induction 
of autophagy during salivary gland destruction. The first of these pulses (0 hour) signals 
for the arrest of cell growth. The second of these pulses, that occurs 12 hour after the 
previous pulse, signals for the induction of autophagy. We know that this arrest in cell 
growth results in reduced activity of PI3K signaling, a process that can regulate 
autophagy. Therefore, if PI3K signaling is not turned off by the 0 hour ecdysone pulse, 
PI3K signaling is sufficient to suppress the induction of autophagy by the 12 hour 
ecdysone pulse (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007).  

 
105 
 
The deactivation of the mTOR complex after the 0 hour ecdysone pulse is also 
necessary for the induction of autophagy in the salivary glands (Berry & Baehrecke, 
2007). This is not unexpected as PI3K activity has been shown to regulate mTOR 
activity, and mTOR can directly influence the Atg1 complex (Chang & Neufeld, 2009; 
Hosokawa, Hara, et al., 2009; Wullschleger et al., 2006). As pupae cannot feed, it cannot 
be ruled out that nutrient sensing influences the repression of PI3K and mTOR activity in 
the salivary glands thereby allowing for the later induction of autophagy. However, the 
influence that this hypothetical pupal-associated nutrient deprivation has on the induction 
of autophagy in the salivary glands is most likely minimal for two possible reasons. The 
first reason: starvation of larvae fails to induce large amounts of autophagy in the salivary 
glands (unpublished observation). This failure for nutrient deprivation to induce 
autophagy in the salivary glands makes sense because the salivary glands do not have 
large nutrient stores like the fat body. The second reason: the induction of autophagy in 
the glands does not occur until the second steroid pulse, and by that time, the animals 
have been nutrient-deprived for 12 hours. This suggests that although PI3K and mTOR 
need to be deactivated for the induction of autophagy in the salivary glands, it is not their 
deactivation that directly induces the autophagy machinery the way they do in the starved 
fat body. Rather, there must be some other influence(s) that induces autophagy 12 hour 
later.  
This suggests that another inhibitory mechanism may exist in the salivary glands 
that continues to repress the induction of autophagy, and that miR-14 somehow relieves 
this repression after the 12 hour ecdysone pulse. In this scenario this hypothetical 

 
106 
 
inhibitor of autophagy would not present in the fat body and mid gut thereby allowing for 
the induction of autophagy through repression of the PI3K and mTOR pathways in 
response to the 0 hour ecdysone pulse. Therefore, mis-expression of miR-14 in these 
tissues would fail to influence autophagy in these tissues because this hypothetical 
inhibitor is not present in them. Moreover, in order for miR-14 mis-expression to induce 
autophagy the salivary glands, relief of this hypothetical repression would need to be 
strong enough to trigger autophagy despite the presence of the active PI3K and mTOR 
pathways (modeled in Figure 3.1). Additionally, miR-14 may also induce activators of 
autophagy that are sufficient to somehow induce autophagy specifically in the salivary 
glands. 
 
 

 
107 
 
 
Figure 3.1. A hypothetical model of how ecdysone induces autophagy in the midgut, 
fat body, and salivary glands.  
In the midgut and fat body, I hypothesize that cell growth pathways such as PI3K and 
mTOR are the only inhibitors of autophagy, and that ecdysone helps relieve this 
inhibition. Therefore, autophagy can be induced at 0h when these pathways are inhibited. 
In the salivary gland, I hypothesize that in addition to PI3K and mTOR pathways’ 
inhibition being relieved at 0h, other inhibitor(s) are present that continue to repress 
autophagy until miR-14 expression at 12h results in the mitigation of these hypothetical 
inhibitors.  
 
 
 

 
108 
 
B. Steroid induced autophagy 
 
While the PI3K and mTOR nutrient sensing/cell growth pathways play obvious 
roles in both regulating autophagy during salivary gland destruction as well as in the 
nutrient deprived fat body, there are clearly differences in the regulation of autophagy in 
these two contexts. To determine what these differences are, we can focus on the salivary 
glands as less is known about what regulates autophagy in the tissue. 
 
Being a steroid, ecdysone binds to its receptor to directly induce the transcription 
of target genes. Many of these target genes, including Ecdysone Receptor, Broad 
Complex, and E93 (see Figure 2.3C), are also transcription factors that induce the 
transcription of more target genes (Baehrecke & Thummel, 1995; Fletcher & Thummel, 
1995; Karim & Thummel, 1992). We know that these transcription factors are all 
necessary for the destruction of the salivary glands (Baehrecke & Thummel, 1995; 
Restifo & White, 1992). Therefore, due to this ecdysone pulse, thousands of transcript 
levels change, and some, presumably, influence autophagy in a salivary gland-specific 
manner. Using this presumption, members of the Baehrecke lab have performed detailed 
micro-array and proteomic studies in which wild-type salivary glands from times ranging 
from 6 hours after puparium formation to 14 hours after puparium formation were 
analyzed (Martin et al., 2007; McPhee et al., 2013).  
From these studies, Draper was identified as the first example of a gene that is 
necessary for autophagy specifically during salivary gland destruction. Interestingly, 
Draper appears to function in a novel way that is uncharacteristic of its initially described 

 
109 
 
functions as an engulfment receptor for phagocytic cells. This difference in function in 
the salivary gland is not completely surprising as phagocytes are not involved in the 
destruction of the salivary glands. In addition, other genes that are known to function in 
the Draper-associated engulfment pathway also regulate salivary gland-specific 
autophagy. Moreover, Draper also appears to function upstream of Atg1. Since Atg1 is 
one of the most upstream elements in the core autophagy pathway, this suggests that one 
means of regulating this salivary gland-specific autophagy is to have different regulators 
upstream of the core machinery. Unfortunately, how Draper regulates autophagy and 
if/how ecdysone influences Draper activity in the salivary glands are unknown. Because 
salivary gland destruction is so complex, most likely in addition to Draper there are other 
regulatory mechanisms that help distinguish the use of autophagy in various contexts 
(McPhee et al., 2010). 
 
To achieve complete salivary gland destruction, many processes, including 
ecdysone signaling, cell growth arrest, caspase activation and autophagy induction, have 
to be properly timed, implemented and coordinated. To achieve this, there must be 
extensive regulatory mechanisms that allow for these processes to be flawlessly 
coordinated. In addition, to ensure genetic robustness as well as efficient and proper 
implementation of the thousands of new transcripts, post-transcriptional regulation most 
likely occurs. Therefore, I hypothesized that microRNAs are involved in coordinating 
salivary gland destruction. Moreover, I further hypothesized that microRNAs could serve 
as a mechanism to help distinguish between the use of autophagy during cell survival and 
cell death. 

 
110 
 
 
To test my hypothesis, I took a broad approach and asked if the microRNA 
processing machinery is necessary for salivary gland destruction, and not surprisingly, it 
was. As described in more detail in Chapter II, the salivary gland material that I observed 
was diffuse and no longer retained any shape of the salivary glands indicating that when 
the microRNA machinery is inhibited, partial destruction of the glands still occurs. Based 
on that observation, I suspected that ecdysone signaling was not completely inhibited 
because ecdysone inhibition results in a stronger, gland phenotype. Therefore, this partial 
degradation phenotype was more indicative of a defect in cell growth arrest, autophagy, 
or caspases. Additionally, the possibility also remained that there could be partial defects 
in multiple pathways resulting in this phenotype. Through extensive testing (as described 
in Chapter II), I was able to identify the microRNA miR-14 to regulate autophagy 
specifically in the salivary gland. Furthermore, I was able to show that miR-14 
accomplished this by regulating its target ip3k2 and thereby controlling calcium signaling 
(analysis of this regulation will be discussed in more detail in the next section). 
While studying the role that miR-14 has in regulating autophagy in the salivary 
gland, I observed that when using the mCherry-Atg8 autophagy reporter, the puncta were 
significantly larger than the puncta I observed in the starved fat body (Compare Figures 
2.4C and E; Figure 3.2). Therefore, this difference in puncta size indicates a possible 
morphological difference of when autophagy is used during cell death versus cell 
survival. 

 
111 
 
 
As described in Chapter II, mis-expression of miR-14 resulted in the premature 
induction of autophagy in the salivary gland. Interestingly, this mis-expression was in 
wandering larval glands, the resulting mCherry-Atg8 puncta were significantly smaller 
than what I observed in control animals at 14 hour after puparium formation. Perhaps 
even more interesting was that mis-expression of miR-14 in the salivary glands at 14 
hours after puparium formation did not result in same small puncta of wandering glands, 
but rather, it drastically enhanced the large puncta phenotype observed in control glands 
(Figures 3.3).

larvae (A) and 14 h (B) for analyses of mCherry-Atg8a puncta (white). Salivary gland 
nuclei were all stained with Hoechst (blue). Scale bars represent 50 µm. The left 
panels show only the GFP and Hoechst channels, the middle panels show only the 
GFP and mCherry channels. The right panels show all three channels. 
 
 

 
114 
 
 
 
From those observations, I can begin to hypothesize about the role autophagy 
plays during cell death. Because mis-expression of miR-14  can induce the premature 
induction of autophagy in the salivary glands indicates that the salivary glands are primed 
to start the autophagy program, and that the limited factor for this induction is miR-14. 
However, this prematurely-induced autophagy has a small puncta phenotype whereas the 
puncta observed in dying glands is significantly larger. Additionally, since miR-14 is 
necessary for any mCherry-Atg8 puncta during salivary gland destruction, and its mis-
expression can enhance the large puncta phenotype observed during destruction, this 
suggests that there are other factors that transform these small, miR-14-induced puncta to 
the large puncta observed during degradation. Moreover, as this large puncta phenotype 
occurs at 14 hours after puparium formation, it is safe to assume that these transformative 
factors are induced as a result of the ecdysone pulse. Therefore, I propose that, based on 
published results (Varghese & Cohen, 2009) and my Taqman data (Table 2.1), in the 
salivary glands, the ecdysone pulse at 12 hours directly induces the transcription of miR-
14, and that miR-14 then induces the small puncta version of autophagy. Simultaneously, 
I believe that ecdysone also induces the transformative factors that modify these small 
puncta into the large puncta that is associated with salivary gland destruction. If these 
transformative elements actually exist, how they transform the puncta size, and what this 
means is still unknown. 
 
It is interesting to note that larger puncta have been previously observed in other 
Drosophila larval tissues that undergo developmentally induced autophagy. Therefore, it 

 
115 
 
is conceivable that this large puncta phenotype is a hallmark of ecdysone-induced 
autophagic cell death. During the larval stages, relatively high levels of basal autophagy 
can be observed in the midgut. This is not surprising as the intestine is a stressful 
environment. Interestingly, the midgut responds to the 0 hour ecdysone pulse by 
increasing autophagy levels as well as the mCherry-Atg8a puncta size (Chang et al., 
2013). Perhaps even more interesting is that this large puncta phenotype has also been 
observed in the fat body of animals undergoing puparium formation (Figure 3.1A and B). 
Moreover, this induction of large puncta autophagy in the fat body is dependent upon the 
same ecdysone pulse that signals for the destruction of the midgut (Rusten et al., 2004). 
Additionally, similar to the salivary gland, in both the midgut and the fat body, this 
ecdysone pulse also signals for the repression of PI3K induced cell growth thereby 
promoting the induction of autophagy in the fat body (Denton et al., 2012; Rusten et al., 
2004).  
Although still induced by ecdysone, the utilization of autophagy in these three 
tissues appears to be slightly different in each case. In the salivary gland, autophagy is 
used to help completely degrade the tissue. In the midgut, autophagy is used to help 
shrink the cells down into a tiny structure called the meconium that is then excreted by 
the adult intestine. In the fat body, it is still debated as to how much of the tissue 
undergoes cell death, and what role autophagy may play in that process. Although the 
regulation of ecdysone-induced autophagy may be different in all three tissues, the 
similarities of the large-puncta phenotype indicate a commonality in the use of 
autophagy.  

 
116 
 
Based on these observations and the literature available, I believe that this large 
puncta form of autophagy is an indication of developmentally induced autophagy. 
Additionally, it appears that a more canonical, small puncta autophagy is initially induced 
in all of these contexts and then transformed via unknown factors into the large puncta 
autophagy  that are associated with cell death. In the midgut and fat body small puncta 
autophagy may have been already induced as the relatively high levels of basal 
autophagy and as starvation-induced autophagy, respectively. Moreover, I believe that 
the ecdysone pulse at 0h increases the levels of this small puncta autophagy in the fat 
body and midgut through further inhibition of the PI3K and mTOR pathways. In the 
salivary glands, the transcription of miR-14 induces this small puncta autophagy 
(modeled in Figure 3.4).  
Interestingly, the transformation from the use of autophagy for cell survival to the 
promotion of cell death has already been observed in Dictyostelium. As explained in 
Chapter I, in Dictyostelium, autophagy has to first be induced as a starvation response, 
and then in combination with another factor, DIF-1, autophagy is transformed into a 
mechanism by which cells are killed. Fascinatingly, the ip3-receptor was found to be 
necessary for this process (Lam et al., 2008). This overlap with my ip3-receptor findings 
not only suggests this process may be conserved, but it also strengthens my speculation 
of transformative factors that convert autophagy towards a cell death mechanism. 
 
Finally, what could this difference in puncta size mean? Perhaps the large puncta 
are indicative of a high level of bulk degradation of cellular material. This makes sense 

 
117 
 
because during this form of cell death, autophagy is induced to help degrade the tissue, 
and possibly larger puncta are indicative of increased cellular degradation. Also, the 
puncta could be larger because they are targeted to selectively degrade larger cellular 
components such as organelles. In fact, high levels of mitochondrial degradation have 
been observed in the dying midgut (Chang et al., 2013). Moreover, these larger puncta 
could reflect a change in fusion between lysosomes and autophagosomes. It has been 
speculated that the number of lysosomes that fuse with autophagosomes can depend on 
the amount of cargo that is being degraded (Yu et al., 2010). It may be that during 
ecdysone-induced autophagy more cargo is degraded, and therefore, more lysosomes are 
needed to degrade the material thereby creating larger autolysosomes.

Figure 3.4. A model of how small puncta is induced in the fat body, midgut, and 
salivary glands, and how hypothetical element(s) are induced to increase the puncta 
size leading to cell death. 
In the fat body, I hypothesize that starvation results in the initial induction of small 
puncta autophagy, and at 0h ecdysone increases the amount of this small puncta 
autophagy. Simultaneously, ecdysone also induces transforming elements that change the 
small puncta to large puncta thereby leading to cell death. 
In the midgut, I hypothesize that the stressful environment results in relatively high levels 
of basal small puncta autophagy, and at 0h ecdysone increases the amount of this small 
puncta autophagy. Simultaneously, ecdysone also induces transforming elements that 
change the small puncta to large puncta thereby leading to cell death. 
In the salivary glands, I hypothesize that the 12h ecdysone pulse results in the inductions 
of small puncta autophagy, and simultaneously induces transforming elements that 
change the small puncta to large puncta thereby leading to cell death.

Part II: miR-14 regulation of autophagy 
A rise in miR-14 levels in the salivary glands correlates with the beginning of the 
12 hour ecdysone pulse (see table 2.1), and miR-14 has been shown to be directly induced 
by the Ecdysone Receptor (Varghese & Cohen, 2009). Therefore, I hypothesize that the 
rise in miR-14 levels is due to direct transcription by the Ecdysone Receptor. As 
described in Chapter II, as miR-14 levels increase, its repression of ip3k2 also increases, 
and based on the literature that shows that IP3K2 functions to remove IP3 (Lloyd-Burton 
et al., 2007), I can deduce that miR-14 induced repression of ip3k2 will result in an 
elevation of IP3 levels. Concurrently, this elevation of IP3 results in an increase in 
cytoplasmic calcium levels which then induces autophagy in a Calmodulin-dependent 
manner.  
The fact that miR-14 expression can prematurely induce autophagy indicates that 
it is a limiting factor, and that all other components that are necessary for this autophagic 
induction are either already present in the salivary glands or they become induced in a 
miR-14-dependent manner. However, how miR-14 activates the autophagy machinery is 
unclear. miR-14 regulation of IP3 signaling could be acting upstream of the core 
autophagy components or directly influencing autophagy genes or both. To better 
understand how miR-14 influences autophagy, epistasis experiments can be done.  To 
date, all published regulators of autophagy function upstream of the Atg1 complex in the 
salivary glands. These experiments have taken advantage of the fact that mis-expression 
of Atg1 is sufficient to induce autophagy. Therefore, genes can be tested for regulation of 

 
120 
 
autophagy relative to the Atg1 complex. For example, mis-expression of Atg1 was 
sufficient to suppress the clearance defect observed when the salivary gland specific 
regulator of autophagy Draper was removed indicating that Draper functions upstream 
of the Atg1 complex (Batlevi et al., 2010; Berry & Baehrecke, 2007; Dutta & Baehrecke, 
2008; McPhee et al., 2010).  
Because all known salivary gland regulators of autophagy have been shown to 
function upstream of the core autophagy genes, I hypothesized that miR-14 regulates 
autophagy upstream of the Atg1 complex. Indeed, mis-expression of Atg1 was sufficient 
to induce mCherry-Atg8 puncta in a miR-14 deficient background (Figures 3.5A and 
3.5B). Interestingly, I noticed that when Atg1 was mis-expressed in a control background 
the salivary glands were extremely fragile, and I could not dissect any glands later than 
12 hours after puparium formation indicating that mis-expression of Atg1 prematurely 
degrades the salivary glands. However, I was able to easily dissect salivary glands at 14 
hours after puparium formation when Atg1 was mis-expressed in a miR-14 mutant 
background suggesting that mis-expression of Atg1 in the miR-14 mutant could not 
prematurely degrade the salivary glands.   Therefore, I wished to see if Atg1 mis-
expression was able to suppress the clearance defect observed in miR-14 mutant animals, 
and to my surprise, mis-expression of Atg1 did not suppress this defect (Figures 3.5C and 
3.5D).  Moreover, cells failed to shrink in size when Atg1 was mis-expressed in a miR-14 
mutant background (Figures 3.5E and 3.5F). This ability of Atg1 mis-expression to 
induced mCherry-Atg8 puncta, but not complete the autophagic process as suggested by 
the defect in gland clearance and failure of cells to shrink indicates that miR-14 functions 

 
121 
 
downstream of the Atg1 complex and Atg8 lipidation. In addition, large puncta are still 
observed when Atg1 is mis-expressed in a miR-14 mutant background suggesting that 
vesicles are still formed, and indicating that my hypothesized “transforming” elements 
are still induced. This can be easily tested through electron microscopy to determine if 
the puncta observed are autophagosomes and autolysosomes or if the puncta represent 
something else such as cargo recruitment or protein aggregation when Atg1 is mis-
expressed in a miR-14 mutant background.

This downstream function of miR-14 relative to Atg1 is very interesting as it is the 
first example of a tissue-specific regulator of autophagy behaving in this manner. 
Moreover, loss of miR-14, IP3, the IP3 receptor and Calmodulin all resulted in the failure 
to induce mCherry-Atg8 puncta suggesting that miR-14 regulates autophagy at multiple 
points both upstream and downstream of Atg8 lipidation. Because miR-14 expression is 
sufficient to induce autophagy, it can be assumed that miR-14 somehow activates either 
the Atg1 complex and/or the Vps34 complex as both have been demonstrated to be 
sufficient to induced autophagy activity (Juhász et al., 2008; Scott et al., 2007). 
Furthermore, since it appears that Atg8 can be lipidated when Atg1 is mis-expressed in a 
miR-14 deficient background, but autophagy is still inhibited, miR-14 might also regulate 
downstream aspects of autophagy such as lysosomal fusion or recycling. It is worth 
noting that Atg1-induced autophagy in the salivary gland is suppressed by knocking down 
Atg12 and Atg8 (Berry & Baehrecke, 2007), and therefore, it is interesting to think about 
what factors may be influenced by miR-14. Possibly miR-14 influences the function of 
other downstream Atg genes and/or miR-14 regulates an unknown factor(s) that functions 
downstream of Atg8 lipidation and vesicle formation. 
Our results indicate that calcium plays a pivotal role in regulating autophagy 
during salivary gland degradation, and at least part of this regulation appears to occur 
through Calmodulin. Calmodulin could directly regulate autophagy through direct 
modulation of autophagy components or through regulation of other proteins such as 
Calmodulin-dependent kinases. Interestingly, Calmodulin has been shown to bind Atg5 
and Atg16 in vitro indicating a potential direct connection to Calmodulin regulation of 

 
125 
 
autophagy (Guruharsha et al., 2011). In addition to potentially inducing autophagy 
directly through modulation of proteins such as Calmodulin, calcium levels could 
modulate other processes such as transcription and translation of genes that influence 
autophagy.  
When I looked at the Baehrecke laboratory’s micro-array data collected from 
serial time points during salivary gland degradation, I observed a decrease in ip3k2 levels 
as well as in increase in the IP3 producing enzyme small wing (a gene that encodes a 
phospholipase C). This indicates that not only does miR-14 allow for the elevation of IP3 
levels through repression of ip3k2, but the salivary gland produces more IP3 through 
increased levels of phospholipase C catalyzed hydrolysis of PIP2. Moreover, the micro-
array data indicate that many calcium and/or Calmodulin-binding genes are expressed in 
the dying gland. Additionally, many of these genes’ mRNA levels increase in correlation 
with the ecdysone pulse and salivary gland degradation (Figure 3.6). This suggests a 
strong influence that calcium plays in the destruction of the glands. In fact, preliminary 
data indicate that the Calmodulin-dependent kinase, CamKI, is necessary for salivary 
gland degradation and the induction of autophagy (Figure 3.7).  Interestingly, the mRNA 
levels of CamKI do not increase as the salivary glands undergo destruction indicating that 
the induction of its activity is a limiting factor in its regulation of autophagy. How CamKI 
is regulating autophagy remains unknown, and further study is needed to identify its 
phosphorylation targets and their possible influence on autophagy.

IP3 signaling could also be regulating autophagy in a calcium-independent 
manner. In mammalian cell culture, the IP3 receptor has been shown to bind the Vps34 
complex through a scaffolding protein called NAF1, and the binding of the Vps34 
complex to the IP3 receptor influenced autophagy levels (Chang et al., 2010). It is 
possible that in the salivary gland the conformational change of the IP3-bound IP3 
receptor somehow activates the Vps34 complex thereby initiating autophagy.  
Interestingly, the IP3 receptor is located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum 
which can serve as a membrane source for forming autophagosomes (Hamasaki, Furuta, 
et al., 2013; Hamasaki, Shibutani, et al., 2013). As the Vps34 complex initiates 
autophagosomal membrane elongation, the binding of the Vps34 complex to the IP3 
receptor could serve as an anchoring point to this ER membrane source.   
Until the discovery of miR-14 regulation of autophagy in a salivary gland specific 
manner only Draper had shown this tissue specific phenotype. As mentioned previously, 
Draper is necessary for the degradation of the salivary glands, loss of Draper resulted in 
the lack of Atg8 puncta formation, and Draper was shown to function upstream of Atg1. 
How Draper influences autophagy is unknown. It is suggested that Draper levels are 
increased as a result of the 12 hour ecdysone pulse (McPhee et al., 2010). However, if 
Draper levels need to be elevated for the induction of autophagy to occur is unknown. 
Draper levels might not need to be elevated for it to function as a regulator of autophagy 
because mis-expression of miR-14 can induce autophagy before Draper levels increase. 
Moreoever, mis-expression of Draper failed to prematurely induce autophagy in the 
salivary glands (McPhee et al., 2010). Perhaps, miR-14 expression results in the elevation 

 
130 
 
of Draper levels thereby allowing it to influence autophagy. Possibly, while Draper 
might not need to be elevated for autophagy to occur, its elevation could enhance 
autophagy in the glands. Alternatively, Draper could regulate the activity of miR-14 by 
influencing things such as the transcription, processing, or targeting of miR-14. These are 
unlikely, however, because mis-expression of Atg1 was sufficient to suppress the Draper 
mutant clearance defect, and if Draper affected miR-14, Atg1 mis-expression should not 
suppress its phenotype because Atg1 mis-expression does not suppress the phenotype 
seen by loss of miR-14.  
 
Part III: Conclusions 
 
Autophagy is an extremely fascinating cellular process. It can play pivotal roles in 
development, homeostasis, cell survival, and cell death. The ability of autophagy to 
influence various cellular situations offers the potential for its manipulation in the 
treatment of different diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. To be able to do 
this, we need to understand how autophagy is utilized to achieve such different cellular 
outcomes. Namely, we need to understand how autophagy is regulated in these different 
contexts and how this mechanism of regulation distinguishes between the uses of 
autophagy in these various situations. From this knowledge we can begin to understand 
how we can take advantage of autophagy to treat disease.  
 
In this thesis, I have demonstrated that microRNAs can serve as a regulatory 
mechanism to distinguish between the uses of autophagy during cell death versus cell 

 
131 
 
survival. The microRNA miR-14 regulates autophagy during salivary gland cell death but 
not during nutrient deprivation in Drosophila melanogaster. Although miR-14 appears 
not to have a direct sequence orthologue in mammals, it is possible that other microRNAs 
may function in a similar manner. In Drosophila, miR-14 regulates this cell death-specific 
form of autophagy through the control of IP3 influenced calcium signaling (modeled in 
Figure 3.8). Moreover, this IP3 influence on autophagic cell death appears to be 
conserved. These demonstrations that IP3 signaling can influence autophagy during cell 
death open the doors to manipulating this signaling pathway to modulate autophagy for 
the treatment of human diseases. To be able to do this we still need to understand more 
about the regulation of autophagy during cell death. For example, the salivary glands 
appear to be primed to induce autophagy to achieve destruction; manipulation of the IP3 
pathway had no influence on autophagy in the fat body. Therefore, we need to understand 
how the salivary gland cells are primed to be influence by IP3-regulated autophagic cell 
death, and from this we can use this knowledge to help treat diseases.

Figure 3.8. A model of how miR-14 is predicted to regulate autophagy. 
Before the 12 h ecdysone pulse that signals for salivary gland degradation, IP3K2 exists 
in relatively high levels thereby removing IP3 and keeping cytoplasmic calcium levels 
low. As this occurs, calmodulin becomes less active due to the low calcium 
concentration, and no longer can enhance IP3K2’s ability to remove IP3. As such, more 
IP3 can be produce thereby release more calcium to activate calmodulin, and therefore, 
start the cycle over. This feedback loop ensures that calcium levels remain within the 
“Goldilocks” level. 
Later, when increased calcium levels are necessary to activate autophagy, the ecdysone 
pulse at 12 h signals for the transcription of miR-14 by EcR/USP. After processing by 
Drosha and Dicer, miR-14 then blocks the activity of IP3K2 by inhibiting translation and 

 
133 
 
inducing ip3k2 mRNA degradation. This results in an elevation of IP3 which 
subsequently elevates cytoplasmic calcium levels. Since IP3K2 protein are now so low, 
calmodulin now cannot feedback to tell IP3K2 to lower calcium levels. This allows for 
even more calcium release thereby further activating calmodulin. Calmodulin then can 
activate other genes such as CaMKI which, through an unknown mechanism, induces 
autophagy resulting in cell death.
