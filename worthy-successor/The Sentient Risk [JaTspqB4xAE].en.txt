yes I I do think that the the kind of
sence is good uh having like sort of
like
flourishing uh future for sentient
beings uh where they don't have to
suffer and POS possibly kind of like
populate the rest of the universe that
seems to be dead for now y that's that's
kind of like something to Aspire for
like it's possible that I'm like making
some moral mistakes when I can imagine
that kind of future but it's possible
that I imagine some kind of physically
impossible or inconsistent thing but
like uh this is at least like
aspirationally something that uh can be
debated however this everything should
kind of take a backseat to the fact that
we are about to be wiped out by
non-conscious machines
