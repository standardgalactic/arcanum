so basically I'm very sympathetic with
them in the short term uh because like
again we have like cancer we need
chemotherapy or something like that
Humanity has cancer and might need some
to do something very uncomfortable uh
but of course we shouldn't make sure we
might have to make sure that the Cure is
not worse uh than the disease uh so like
obviously with things like kind of like
authoritarian control uh we might run
the risk of like this being locked in
and then just the future we eventually
petering out as sufficient big rock hits
this planet because we stopped doing
technology Etc which we kind have to in
order to uh kind of uh realize the
potential that Humanity has
