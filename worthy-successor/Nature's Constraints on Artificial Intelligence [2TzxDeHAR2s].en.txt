finally uh nature does have a rate at
which you know there is there are
fundamental limits in nature too there
are physical constants uh yes the N
there are rates at which natural
processes occur uh so AG will have its
own limits in how things how quickly it
can discover things in the world um so
so we will we will see a dramatic boost
but then then things will be uh driven
at the um rate at which nature will
permit yeah yeah and and so uh I don't
see this extreme runaway scenario uh
that that kind of thing um it would be
yes initially it will look like oh wow
look there is a dramatic acceleration
but that dramatic acceleration is not
going to continue forever because there
are real physical limits
