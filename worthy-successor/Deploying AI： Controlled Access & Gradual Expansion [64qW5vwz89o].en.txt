one way to um find out um you know what
are the ways in which we can apply the
technology is to actually deploy it and
give it you know give it incremental
access to affectors right you know so
nothing goes wrong until AI has things
that can affect in the world right and
and true uh things that it can control
in the world uh we if we if you are if
you make sure that we we are increasing
the scope of it only gradually uh and
um then um the devil advocate argument
would be that hey we will find out what
is possible what is not possible by
actually experimenting in the world and
making sure that things when they go
wrong initially are going wrong at the
small scale
