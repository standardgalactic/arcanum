okay and I do think that Humanity could
gain some sort of augmentation I mean
we're already doing it with technology
and it's interesting to ask how we can
kind of
get uh to fix some of these problems I
mean so I you know I've been in the camp
for a long time and still think that
education is a huge tool in in making
humans better uh bringing the um kind of
material IAL well and psychological
wellbeing uh at the top that Humanity
can enjoy for everyone and who knows I
think technology could help us be better
in many ways but I think we do have to
be prudent because we have so much at
stake here
