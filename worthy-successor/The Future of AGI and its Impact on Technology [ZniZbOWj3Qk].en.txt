interest but if I'm to use some of these
short hands like AGI or super
intelligence I think Super intelligence
and the at the end of this decade in the
next five to six years seems pretty
reasonable um now there are exceptions
when K was draw to the for this for
instance like if there's a if something
happens in Taiwan uh then that would
stop the flow of gpus and then that
would set timelines back substantially
or if there's some larger scale
pandemics those would be some of the
main caveats I would I would for this
but um seems fairly pla that we'd have
something like that this decade by
default
