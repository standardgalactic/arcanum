well I think um in order
to be a good scientist and
also take good moral
decisions you have to recognize that you
can be
mistaken and you have to recognize that
there could be multiple standpoints that
are equally consistent with logic and
data sometimes maybe you on one
standpoint this is the way usually human
brains work we tend to adopt an idea a
way to interpret the world and when
someone else has a different
interpretation we we enter into an
argument
