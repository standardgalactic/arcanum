was like four or five years ago I sort
of surmised that maybe the United
Nations you we have these uh standard um
uh sustainable development goals right
we have the
stgs uh the treatment of women fresh
water food Etc uh is it somewhat
inevitable that whether it's the UN or
not there will need to be an
international body there were two that I
had sort of suspected maybe you would
name them differently or or see them
differently one is some sort body that
might help to decide on the trajectory
of intelligence name of this show uh and
it was you know it's 5-year-old blog
post but what are the directions we're
willing to explore and not explore and
what are the directions we're definitely
going to move towards
