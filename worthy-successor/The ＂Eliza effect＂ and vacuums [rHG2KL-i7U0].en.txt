quite a bit of that is the Eliza effect
right which is basically it's the first
time people are interacting with
something that seems to be creating uh
you know an semi sensible answers and
then people see a lot more behind it
than there actually is so yeah you know
I had this joke about philosophers never
bother to ask question about whether my
vacuum cleaner has intentions or uh
beliefs of course my vacuum cleaner has
beliefs right you know but of course it
has beliefs it knows it has a belief of
where it is in the room uh and yeah of
course it it has an uncertainty estimate
and it just believes oh you're talking
about your Roomba yeah yeah oh God okay
my vacuum's not smart but anyway
I you have a you have a sentient vacuum
yes of course
