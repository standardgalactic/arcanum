if we Zoom very very far out and take a
30,000 foot view um we can think of the
emergence of single cellular life and
then some time after that there's
multicellular life and now we're
basically in the transition from
biological life to Digital Life for the
emergence of artificial intelligence
this is how um big this sort of period
is this isn't just you know the
emergence of social media or um are
people going to um use their iPhones too
much or something like that there's a
much larger issue so I think it'd be
important to make sure that this goes
well and so that uh humans can stay uh
humans can stay in control of this
process
