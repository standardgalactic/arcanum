and they say honestly any tiny bit of
inchworming Beyond present hinness is
too much of a risk for our species we
should look for a billion-year future of
man as he is or as she is uh we ought
not alter that because we know what has
happened to lesser species historically
giving up that mantle even by A
millimeter is far too much and we ought
not even be open to those Futures that
Mr Benjo just said that maybe the long
term he would be open to and
um we just need to be like doing I I
think we we do need to protect Humanity
we do need to try to remain safe but we
also need to consider the possibilities
that that exist and it's okay if it
takes time it's
