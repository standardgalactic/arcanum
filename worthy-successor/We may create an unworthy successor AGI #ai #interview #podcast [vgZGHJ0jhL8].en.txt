it it's been one of the hardest things
for me to accept that AI could be
dangerous could be there's too much
unknown uh about you know you know what
what kind of intelligence future let's
say aisi entities would create I I
really don't have any
idea and I think I have too
much I care too much about Humanity to
just forget that feeling so I I want
clearly to preserve Humanity but I I do
think that technology can help us um
have better lives but it can't be at the
expense of losing Humanity so I guess
I'm in the middle there as well yeah
