has so many humanoid robots now you know
so in China this year there's probably
been around 70 large language models
trained by different Chinese
institutions like 50 plus AI conferences
with AGI as a significant theme just
this year right so there China is full
on into this and they they the just salt
or vibe there is that it can be guided
in in a in a positive way and just
thought just thought here is a little
different right so it's not that they
think it'll be entirely good and nothing
bad could could ever ever happen there's
just there's this sort of
overriding idea that nature comes and
goes in in waves and things will correct
themselves and they don't they don't see
AGI as like outside the outside the big
picture of universe Evolution somehow
