the other thing is uh like the church
touring thesis um that and the notion of
touring completeness yes so like any
computation uh in principle can be done
by human uh with uh paper and pencil uh
and we are aware of that fact again so
so it's like uh I
think uh David to uh oor philosopher who
I think is very confused about uh many
things but I he doesn't seem to be
confused of is is this notion of T in
completeness and he he really har this
point that look humans have graduated we
are now touring complete uh we know
things that that in some sense there is
nothing that there's nothing out there
uh that humans cannot in principle not
know
