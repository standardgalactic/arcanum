it's unpopular now to come out there
publicly and say like government pretty
much sucks it's not going to do any good
it's just going to make things worse
like most people who think that will
just keep quiet about it whereas coming
out there and saying yes we need
regulation we need the government to be
responsible and guide things this this
is a very socially acceptable you know
positive sounding thing to do so people
people who think that way are more
likely to go out to media and and and
and and and say that right so I mean I
think you get I think we get a biased
view on how many people like the idea of
regulating AI just from the different us
us is very politically correct in in in
in in a strange way right
