in Singularity net which we've talked
about before and in some Allied projects
like hypercycle and net we're trying to
make a software infrastructure that
allows like live running learning AI
systems scattered across the globe to
operate in a manner with no Central
owner or or or controller right and so
blockchain is one of the
Technologies enabling that that becomes
a confused complicated topic because of
the economics of blockchain with
cryptocurrency and all that but even if
there even if there had been no Bitcoin
and no decentralized blockchainbased
money like the core of blockchain
Technology would still be very useful
for creating a decentralized network of
AI servers with no no Central owner or
controller right
