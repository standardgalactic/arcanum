compassion there are people suffering
right now there are harms that are
happening right now that are caused by

for each other that at least I would
find difficult to
ignore and so although I'm not against
the idea of exploring something better
than
humans uh we have to do it in a way that
is considerate to all the beauty that
currently exist and all the pain that
currently exists and that
