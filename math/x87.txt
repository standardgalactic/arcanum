ρ(a1)ϕ(u1) + · · · + ρ(an)ϕ(un) = 0,
and since (ϕ(u1), . . . , ϕ(un)) is a basis of ρ
∗
(M), we must have ρ(ai) = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n,
which (by injectivity of ρ) implies that ai = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n. Therefore, ϕ is injective.
In particular, if A is a subring of B, then ρ is the inclusion map and Proposition 35.41
shows that a basis of M becomes a basis of M(B) and that M is embedded into M(B)
. It is
also easy to see that if M and N are two free A-modules and f : M → N is a linear map rep￾resented by the matrix X with respect to some bases (u1, . . . , un) of M and (v1, . . . , vm) of N,
then the B-linear map f is also represented by the matrix X over the bases (ϕ(u1), . . . , ϕ(un))
and (ϕ(v1), . . . , ϕ(vm)).
Proposition 35.41 yields another proof of the fact that any two bases of a free A-module
have the same cardinality. Indeed, if m is a maximal ideal in the ring A, then we have the
quotient ring homomorphism π : A → A/m, and we get the A/m-module π
∗
(M). If M is
free, any basis (u1, . . . , un) of M becomes the basis (ϕ(u1), . . . , ϕ(un)) of π
∗
(M); but A/m is
a field, so the dimension n is uniquely determined. This argument also applies to an infinite
basis (ui)i∈I . Observe that by Proposition 35.14, we have an isomorphism
π
∗
(M) = (A/m) ⊗A M ≈ M/mM,
so M/mM is a vector space over the field A/m, which is the argument used in Theorem 35.1.
Proposition 35.42. Given a ring homomomorphism ρ: A → B, for any two A-modules M
and N, there is a unique isomorphism
ρ
∗
(M) ⊗B ρ
∗
(N) ≈ ρ
∗
(M ⊗A N),
such that (1 ⊗ u) ⊗ (1 ⊗ v) 7→ 1 ⊗ (u ⊗ v), for all u ∈ M and all v ∈ N.
The proof uses identities from Proposition 33.13. It is not hard but it requires a little
gymnastic; a good exercise for the reader.

36.1 The Torsion Module Associated With An Endo￾morphism
We saw in Section 7.7 that given a linear map f : E → E from a K-vector space E into itself,
we can define a scalar multiplication ·: K[X] × E → E that makes E into a K]X]-module.
If E is finite-dimensional, this K[X]-module denoted by Ef is a torsion module, and the
main results of this chapter yield important direct sum decompositions of E into subspaces
invariant under f.
Recall that given any polynomial p(X) = a0Xn + a1Xn−1 + · · · + an with coefficients in
the field K, we define the linear map p(f): E → E by
p(f) = a0f
n + a1f
n−1 + · · · + anid,
where f
k = f ◦ · · · ◦ f, the k-fold composition of f with itself. Note that
p(f)(u) = a0f
n
(u) + a1f
n−1
(u) + · · · + anu,
for every vector u ∈ E. Then, we define the scalar multiplication ·: K[X] × E → E by
polynomials as follows: for every polynomial p(X) ∈ K[X], for every u ∈ E,
p(X) · u = p(f)(u).
1
It is easy to verify that this scalar multiplication satisfies the axioms M1, M2, M3, M4:
p · (u + v) = p · u + p · v
(p + q) · u = p · u + q · u
(pq) · u = p · (q · u)
1 · u = u,
1
If necessary to avoid confusion, we use the notion p(X) ·f u instead of p(X) · u.
1285
1286 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
for all p, q ∈ K[X] and all u, v ∈ E. Thus, with this new scalar multiplication, E is a
K[X]-module denoted by Ef .
If p = λ is just a scalar in K (a polynomial of degree 0), then
λ · u = (λid)(u) = λu,
which means that K acts on E by scalar multiplication as before. If p(X) = X (the monomial
X), then
X · u = f(u).
Since K is a field, the ring K[X] is a PID.
If E is finite-dimensional, say of dimension n, since K is a subring of K[X] and since E is
finitely generated over K, the K[X]-module Ef is finitely generated over K[X]. Furthermore,
Ef is a torsion module. This follows from the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem (Theorem 7.15),
but this can also be shown in an elementary fashion as follows. The space Hom(E, E) of
linear maps of E into itself is a vector space of dimension n
2
, therefore the n
2+1 linear maps
id, f, f 2
, . . . , f n
2
are linearly dependent, which yields a nonzero polynomial q such that q(f) = 0.
We can now translate notions defined for modules into notions for endomorphisms of
vector spaces.
1. To say that U is a submodule of Ef means that U is a subspace of E invariant under
f; that is, f(U) ⊆ U.
2. To say that V is a cyclic submodule of Ef means that there is some vector u ∈ V , such
that V is spanned by (u, f(u), . . . , f k
(u), . . .). If E has finite dimension n, then V is
spanned by (u, f(u), . . . , f k
(u)) for some k ≤ n− 1. We say that V is a cyclic subspace
for f with generator u. Sometimes, V is denoted by Z(u; f).
3. To say that the ideal a = (p(X)) (with p(X) a monic polynomial) is the annihilator
of the submodule V means that p(f)(u) = 0 for all u ∈ V , and we call p the minimal
polynomial of V .
4. Suppose Ef is cyclic and let a = (q) be its annihilator, where
q(X) = X
n + an−1X
n−1 + · · · + a1X + a0.
Then, there is some vector u such that (u, f(u), . . . , f k
(u)) span Ef , and because q is
the minimal polynomial of Ef , we must have k = n−1. The fact that q(f) = 0 implies
that
f

(u) = −a0u − a1f(u) − · · · − an−1f
n−1

and so f is represented by the following matrix known as the companion matrix of
q(X):

It is an easy exercise to prove that the characteristic polynomial χU (X) of U gives
back q(X):
χU (X) = q(X).
We will need the following proposition to characterize when two linear maps are similar.
Proposition 36.1. Let f : E → E and f
0 : E
0 → E
0 be two linear maps over the vector
spaces E and E
0 . A linear map g : E → E
0 can be viewed as a linear map between the
K[X]-modules Ef and Ef
0 iff
g ◦ f = f
0 ◦ g.
Proof. First, suppose g is K[X]-linear. Then, we have
g(p ·f u) = p ·f
0 g(u)
for all p ∈ K[X] and all u ∈ E, so for p = X we get
g(p ·f u) = g(X ·f u) = g(f(u))
and
p ·f
0 g(u) = X ·f
0 g(u) = f
0 (g(u)),
which means that g ◦ f = f
0 ◦ g.
Conversely, if g ◦ f = f
0 ◦ g, we prove by induction that
g ◦ f
n = f
0
n
◦ g, for all n ≥ 1.
Indeed, we have
g ◦ f
n+1 = g ◦ f
n

n

0 ◦ g

0
n+1 ◦ g,
1288 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
establishing the induction step. It follows that for any polynomial p(X) = P n
k=0 akXk
, we
have
g(p(X) ·f u) = g

(g(u))
= p(X) ·f
0 g(u),
so, g is indeed K[X]-linear.
Definition 36.1. We say that the linear maps f : E → E and f
0 : E
0 → E
0 are similar iff
there is an isomorphism g : E → E
0 such that
f
0 = g ◦ f ◦ g
−1
,
or equivalently,
g ◦ f = f
0 ◦ g.
Then, Proposition 36.1 shows the following fact:
Proposition 36.2. With notation of Proposition 36.1, two linear maps f and f
0 are similar
iff g is an isomorphism between Ef and Ef
0
0
.
Later on, we will see that the isomorphism of finitely generated torsion modules can be
characterized in terms of invariant factors, and this will be translated into a characteriza￾tion of similarity of linear maps in terms of so-called similarity invariants. If f and f
0 are
represented by matrices A and A0 over bases of E and E
0 , then f and f
0 are similar iff the
matrices A and A0 are similar (there is an invertible matrix P such that A0 = P AP −1
).
Similar matrices (and endomorphisms) have the same characteristic polynomial.
It turns out that there is a useful relationship between Ef and the module K[X] ⊗K E.
Observe that the map ·: K[X] × E → E given by
p · u = p(f)(u)
is K-bilinear, so it yields a K-linear map σ : K[X] ⊗K E → E such that
σ(p ⊗ u) = p · u = p(f)(u).
36.1. THE TORSION MODULE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ENDOMORPHISM 1289
We know from Section 35.6 that K[X] ⊗K E is a K[X]-module (obtained from the inclusion
K ⊆ K[X]), which we will denote by E[X]. Since E is a vector space, E[X] is a free
K[X]-module, and if (u1, . . . , un) is a basis of E, then (1 ⊗ u1, . . . , 1 ⊗ un) is a basis of E[X].
The free K[X]-module E[X] is not as complicated as it looks. Over the basis
(1 ⊗ u1, . . . , 1 ⊗ un), every element z ∈ E[X] can be written uniquely as
z = p1(1 ⊗ u1) + · · · + pn(1 ⊗ un) = p1 ⊗ u1 + · · · + pn ⊗ un,
where p1, . . . , pn are polynomials in K[X]. For notational simplicity, we may write
z = p1u1 + · · · + pnun,
where p1, . . . , pn are viewed as coefficients in K[X]. With this notation, we see that E[X] is
isomorphic to (K[X])n
, which is easy to understand.
Observe that σ is K[X]-linear, because
σ(q(p ⊗ u)) = σ((qp) ⊗ u)
= (qp) · u
= q(f)(p(f)(u))
= q · (p(f)(u))
= q · σ(p ⊗ u).
Therefore, σ is a linear map of K[X]-modules, σ : E[X] → Ef . Using our simplified notation,
if z = p1u1 + · · · + pnun ∈ E[X], then
σ(z) = p1(f)(u1) + · · · + pn(f)(un),
which amounts to plugging f for X and evaluating. Similarly, f is a K[X]-linear map of Ef ,
because
f(p · u) = f(p(f)(u))
= (fp(f))(u)
= p(f)(f(u))
= p · f(u),
where we used the fact that fp(f) = p(f)f because p(f) is a polynomial in f. By Proposition
35.40, the linear map f : E → E induces a K[X]-linear map f : E[X] → E[X] such that
f(p ⊗ u) = p ⊗ f(u).
Observe that we have
f(σ(p ⊗ u)) = f(p(f)(u)) = p(f)(f(u))
1290 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
and
σ(f(p ⊗ u)) = σ(p ⊗ f(u)) = p(f)(f(u)),
so we get
σ ◦ f = f ◦ σ. (∗)
Using our simplified notation,
f(p1u1 + · · · + pnun) = p1f(u1) + · · · + pnf(un).
Define the K[X]-linear map ψ: E[X] → E[X] by
ψ(p ⊗ u) = (Xp) ⊗ u − p ⊗ f(u).
Observe that ψ = X1E[X] −f, which we abbreviate as X1−f. Using our simplified notation
ψ(p1u1 + · · · + pnun) = Xp1u1 + · · · + Xpnun − (p1f(u1) + · · · + pnf(un)).
It should be noted that everything we did in Section 36.1 applies to modules over a
commutative ring A, except for the statements that assume that A[X] is a PID. So, if M
is an A-module, we can define the A[X]-modules Mf and M[X] = A[X] ⊗A M, except that
Mf is generally not a torsion module, and all the results showed above hold. Then, we have
the following remarkable result.
Theorem 36.3. (The Characteristic Sequence) Let A be a ring and let E be an A-module.
The following sequence of A[X]-linear maps is exact:
0
/ E[X]
ψ
/
E[X]
σ / Ef
/ 0.
This means that ψ is injective, σ is surjective, and that Im(ψ) = Ker (σ). As a consequence,
Ef is isomorphic to the quotient of E[X] by Im(X1 − f).
Proof. Because σ(1 ⊗ u) = u for all u ∈ E, the map σ is surjective. We have
σ(X(p ⊗ u)) = X · σ(p ⊗ u)
= f(σ(p ⊗ u)),
which shows that
σ ◦ X1 = f ◦ σ = σ ◦ f,
using (∗). This implies that
σ ◦ ψ = σ ◦ (X1 − f)
= σ ◦ X1 − σ ◦ f
= σ ◦ f − σ ◦ f = 0,
36.1. THE TORSION MODULE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ENDOMORPHISM 1291
and thus, Im(ψ) ⊆ Ker (σ). It remains to prove that Ker (σ) ⊆ Im(ψ).
Since the monomials Xk
form a basis of A[X], by Proposition 35.13 (with the roles of M
and N exchanged), every z ∈ E[X] = A[X] ⊗A E has a unique expression as
z =
X
k
X
k ⊗ uk,
for a family (uk) of finite support of uk ∈ E. If z ∈ Ker (σ), then
0 = σ(z) = X
k
f
k
(uk),
which allows us to write
z =
X

Now, X1 and f commute, since
(X1 ◦ f)(p ⊗ u) = (X1)(p ⊗ f(u))
= (Xp) ⊗ f(u)
and
(f ◦ X1)(p ⊗ u) = f((Xp) ⊗ u)
= (Xp) ⊗ f(u),
so we can write

1292 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
which shows that z = ψ(y) for some y ∈ E[X].
Finally, we prove that ψ is injective as follows. We have
ψ(z) = ψ

where (uk) is a family of finite support of uk ∈ E. If ψ(z) = 0, then

k
X
k+1 ⊗ (uk − f(uk+1)) = 0,
and because the Xk
form a basis of A[X], we must have
uk − f(uk+1) = 0, for all k.
Since (uk) has finite support, there is a largest k, say m + 1 so that um+1 = 0, and then from
uk = f(uk+1),
we deduce that uk = 0 for all k. Therefore, z = 0, and ψ is injective.
Remark: The exact sequence of Theorem 36.3 yields a presentation of Mf .
Since A[X] is a free A-module, A[X]⊗AM is a free A-module, but A[X]⊗AM is generally
not a free A[X]-module. However, if M is a free module, then M[X] is a free A[X]-module,
since if (ui)i∈I is a basis for M, then (1 ⊗ ui)i∈I is a basis for M[X]. This allows us to define
the characterisctic polynomial χf (X) of an endomorphism of a free module M as
χf (X) = det(X1 − f).
Note that to have a correct definition, we need to define the determinant of a linear map
allowing the indeterminate X as a scalar, and this is what the definition of M[X] achieves
(among other things). Theorem 36.3 can be used to give a short proof of the Cayley-Hamilton
Theorem, see Bourbaki [25] (Chapter III, Section 8, Proposition 20). Proposition 7.10 is still
the crucial ingredient of the proof.
36.2. THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM 1293
36.2 The Rational Canonical Form
Let E be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field K, and let f : E → E be an endomor￾phism of E. We know from Section 36.1 that there is a K[X]-module Ef associated with f,
and that Ef is a finitely generated torsion module over the PID K[X]. In this chapter, we
show how Theorems from Sections 35.4 and 35.5 yield important results about the structure
of the linear map f.
Recall that the annihilator of a subspace V is an ideal (p) uniquely defined by a monic
polynomial p called the minimal polynomial of V .
Our first result is obtained by translating the primary decomposition theorem, Theorem
35.19. It is not too surprising that we obtain again Theorem 31.10!
Theorem 36.4. (Primary Decomposition Theorem) Let f : E → E be a linear map on the
finite-dimensional vector space E over the field K. Write the minimal polynomial m of f as
m = p
r

· · · p
r
k
k
,
where the pi are distinct irreducible monic polynomials over K, and the ri are positive inte￾gers. Let
Wi = Ker (pi(f)
ri
), i = 1, . . . , k.
Then
(a) E = W1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Wk.
(b) Each Wi is invariant under f and the projection from W onto Wi is given by a poly￾nomial in f.
(c) The minimal polynomial of the restriction f | Wi of f to Wi is p
r
i
i
.
Example 36.1. Let f : R
4 → R
4 be defined as f(x, y, z, w) = (x + w, y + z, y + z, x + w).
In terms of the standard basis, f has the matrix representation
M =


1 0 0 1
0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 1

 .
A basic calculation shows that χf (X) = X2
(X − 2)2 and that mf (X) = X(X − 2). The
primary decomposition theorem implies that
R
4 = W1 ⊕ W2, W1 = Ker (M), W2 = Ker (M − 2I).
Note that Ker (M) corresponds to the eigenspace associated with eigenvalue 0 and has basis
([−1, 0, 0, 1], [0, −1, 1, 0]), while Ker (M − 2I) corresponds to the eigenspace associated with
eigenvalue 2 and has basis ([1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]).
1294 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
Next we apply the Invariant Factors Decomposition Theorem, Theorem 35.31, to Ef .
This theorem says that Ef is isomorphic to a direct sum
Ef ≈ K[X]/(p1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ K[X]/(pm)
of m ≤ n cyclic modules, where the pj are uniquely determined monic polynomials of degree
at least 1, such that
pm | pm−1 | · · · | p1.
Each cyclic module K[X]/(pi) is isomorphic to a cyclic subspace for f, say Vi
, whose minimal
polynomial is pi
.
It is customary to renumber the polynomials pi as follows. The n polynomials q1, . . . , qn
are defined by:
qj (X) = ( 1 if 1 ≤ j ≤ n − m
pn−j+1(X) if n − m + 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
Then we see that
q1 | q2 | · · · | qn,
where the first n − m polynomials are equal to 1, and we have the direct sum
E = E1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ En,
where Ei
is a cyclic subspace for f whose minimal polynomial is qi
. In particular, Ei = (0)
for i = 1, . . . , n − m. Theorem 35.31 also says that the minimal polynomial of f is qn = p1.
We sum all this up in the following theorem.
Theorem 36.5. (Cyclic Decomposition Theorem, First Version) Let f : E → E be an
endomorphism on a K-vector space of dimension n. There exist n monic polynomials
q1, . . . , qn ∈ K[X] such that
q1 | q2 | · · · | qn,
and E is the direct sum
E = E1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ En
of cyclic subspaces Ei = Z(ui
; f) for f, such that the minimal polynomial of the restriction
of f to Ei
is qi
. The polynomials qi satisfying the above conditions are unique, and qn is the
minimal polynomial of f.
In view of translation point (4) at the beginning of Section 36.1, we know that over the
basis
(ui
, f(ui), . . . , f ni−1
(ui))
36.2. THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM 1295
of the cyclic subspace Ei = Z(ui
; f), with ni = deg(qi), the matrix of the restriction of f to
Ei
is the companion matrix of pi(X), of the form


.
If we put all these bases together, we obtain a block matrix whose blocks are of the above
form. Therefore, we proved the following result.
Theorem 36.6. (Rational Canonical Form, First Version) Let f : E → E be an endomor￾phism on a K-vector space of dimension n. There exist n monic polynomials q1, . . . , qn ∈
K[X] such that
q1 | q2 | · · · | qn,
with q1 = · · · = qn−m = 1, and a basis of E such that the matrix M of f is a block matrix of
the form
M =

,
where each Mi is the companion matrix of qi. The polynomials qi satisfying the above condi￾tions are unique, and qn is the minimal polynomial of f.
Definition 36.2. A matrix M as in Theorem 36.6 is called a matrix in rational form. The
polynomials q1, . . . , qn arising in Theorems 36.5 and 36.6 are called the similarity invariants
(or invariant factors) of f.
Theorem 36.6 shows that every matrix is similar to a matrix in rational form. Such a
matrix is unique.
Example 1 continued: We will calculate the rational canonical form for f(x, y, z, w) =
(x + w, y + z, y + z, x + w). The difficulty in finding the rational canonical form lies in
determining the invariant factors q1, q2, q3, q4. As we will shortly discover, the invariant
factors of f correspond to the invariant factors of XI −M. See Propositions 36.8 and 36.11.
The invariant factors of XI − M are found by converting XI − M to Smith normal form.
Section 36.5 describes an algorithmic procedure for computing the Smith normal form of a
matrix. By applying the methodology of Section 36.5, we find that Smith normal form for
1296 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
XI − M is

0 1 0 0
0 0

X(X − 2) 0


 .
Thus the invariant factors of f are q1 = 1 = q2, q3 = X(X − 2) = q4, and Theorem 36.5
implies that
R
4 = E1 ⊕ E2,
where E1 = Z(u1, f) ∼= R[X]/(X(X − 2)) and E2 = Z(u2, f) ∼= R[X]/(X(X − 2)). The
subspace E1 has basis (u1, Mu1) where u1 = (1, 0, 1, 0) and Mu1 = (1, 1, 1, 1), while the
subspace E2 has basis (u2, Mu2) where u2 = (0, 0, 1, 0) and Mu2 = (0, 1, 1, 0). Theorem 36.6
implies that rational canonical form of M(f) is

By Proposition 36.2, two linear maps f and f
0 are similar iff there is an isomorphism
between Ef and Ef
0
0
, and thus by the uniqueness part of Theorem 35.31, iff they have the
same similarity invariants q1, . . . , qn.
Proposition 36.7. If E and E
0 are two finite-dimensional vector spaces and if f : E → E
and f
0 : E
0 → E
0 are two linear maps, then f and f
0 are similar iff they have the same
similarity invariants.
The effect of extending the field K to a field L is the object of the next proposition.
Proposition 36.8. Let f : E → E be a linear map on a K-vector space E, and let (q1, . . . , qn)
be the similarity invariants of f. If L is a field extension of K (which means that K ⊆ L),
and if E(L) = L⊗K E is the vector space obtained by extending the scalars, and f(L) = 1L ⊗f
the linear map of E(L)
induced by f, then the similarity invariants of f(L) are (q1, . . . , qn)
viewed as polynomials in L[X].
Proof. We know that Ef is isomorphic to the direct sum
Ef ≈ K[X]/(q1K[X]) ⊕ · · · ⊕ K[X]/(qnK[X]),
so by tensoring with L[X] and using Propositions 35.12 and 33.13, we get
L[X] ⊗K[X] Ef ≈ L[X] ⊗K[X] (K[X]/(q1K[X]) ⊕ · · · ⊕ K[X]/(qnK[X]))
≈ L[X] ⊗K[X] (K[X]/(q1K[X])) ⊕ · · · ⊕ L[X] ⊗K[X] (K[X]/(qnK[X]))
≈ (K[X]/(q1K[X])) ⊗K[X] L[X] ⊕ · · · ⊕ (K[X]/(qnK[X])) ⊗K[X] L[X].
36.2. THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM 1297
However, by Proposition 35.14, we have isomorphisms
(K[X]/(qiK[X])) ⊗K[X] L[X] ≈ L[X]/(qiL[X]),
so we get
L[X] ⊗K[X] Ef ≈ L[X]/(q1L[X]) ⊕ · · · ⊕ L[X]/(qnL[X]).
Since Ef is a K[X]-module, the L[X] module L[X]⊗K[X] Ef is the module obtained from Ef
by the ring extension K[X] ⊆ L[X]. The L-module E(L) = L⊗K E becomes the L[X]-module
E(L)f(L) where
f(L) = idL ⊗K f.
We have the following proposition
Proposition 36.9. For any field extension K ⊆ L, and any linear map f : E → E where E
is a K-vector space, there is an isomorphism between the L[X]-modules L[X] ⊗K[X] Ef and
E(L)f(L)
.
Proof. First we define the map α: L × E → L[X] ⊗K[X] Ef by
α(λ, u) = λ ⊗K[X] u.
It is immediately verified that α is K-bilinear, so we obtain a K-linear map αe: L ⊗K E →
L[X] ⊗K[X] Ef . Now E(L) = L ⊗K E is a L[X]-module (L ⊗K E)f(L)
, and let us denote this
scalar multiplication by  . To describe  it is enough to define how a monomial aXk ∈ L[X]
acts on a generator (λ ⊗K u) ∈ L ⊗K E. We have
aXk 
(λ ⊗K u) = a(idL ⊗K f)
k
(λ ⊗K u)
= a(λ ⊗K f
k
(u))
= aλ ⊗K f
k
(u).
We claim that αe is actually L[X]-linear. Indeed, we have
e
α(aXk 
(λ ⊗K u)) = αe(aλ ⊗K f
k
(u))
= aλ ⊗K[X] f
k
(u),
and by the definition of scalar multiplication in the K[X]-module Ef , we have f
k
(u) = Xk
·fu,
so we have
e
α(aXk 
(λ ⊗K u)) = aλ ⊗K[X] f
k
(u)
= aλ ⊗K[X] X
k
·f u
= X
k
· (aλ ⊗K[X] u)
= aXk
· (λ ⊗K[X] u),
which shows that αe is L[X]-linear.
1298 CHAPTER 36. NORMAL FORMS; THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM
We also define the map β : L[X] × Ef → (L ⊗K E)f(L)
by
β(q(X), u) = q(X)  (1 ⊗K u).
Using a computation similar to the computation that we just performed, we can check that
β is K[X]-bilinear so we obtain a map e β : L[X] ⊗K[X] Ef → (L ⊗K E)f(L)
. To finish the
proof, it suffices to prove that αe ◦ e β and e β ◦ αe are the identity on generators. We have
e
α ◦ e β(q(X) ⊗K[X] u) = αe(q(X)  (1 ⊗K u)) = q(X) · (1 ⊗K[X] u)) = q(X) ⊗K[X] u,
and
e
β ◦ αe(λ ⊗K u) = e β(λ ⊗K[X] u) = λ  (1 ⊗K u) = λ ⊗K u,
which finishes the proof.
By Proposition 36.9,
E(L)f(L) ≈ L[X] ⊗K[X] Ef ≈ L[X]/(q1L[X]) ⊕ · · · ⊕ L[X]/(qnL[X]),
which shows that (q1, . . . , qn) are the similarity invariants of f(L)
.
Proposition 36.8 justifies the terminology “invariant” in similarity invariants. Indeed,
under a field extension K ⊆ L, the similarity invariants of f(L) remain the same. This is not
true of the elementary divisors, which depend on the field; indeed, an irreducible polynomial
p ∈ K[X] may split over L[X]. Since qn is the minimal polynomial of f, the above reasoning
also shows that the minimal polynomial of f(L) remains the same under a field extension.
Proposition 36.8 has the following corollary.
Proposition 36.10. Let K be a field and let L ⊇ K be a field extension of K. For any
two square matrices A and B over K, if there is an invertible matrix Q over L such that
B = QAQ−1
, then there is an invertible matrix P over K such that B = P AP −1
.
Recall from Theorem 36.3 that the sequence of K[X]-linear maps
0
/ E[X]
ψ
/
E[X]
σ / Ef
/ 0
is exact, and as a consequence, Ef is isomorphic to the quotient of E[X] by Im(X1 − f).
Furthermore, because E is a vector space, E[X] is a free module with basis (1⊗u1, . . . , 1⊗un),
where (u1, . . . , un) is a basis of E, and since ψ is injective, the module Im(X1 − f) has rank
n. By Theorem 35.31, we have an isomorphism
Ef ≈ K[X]/(q1K[X]) ⊕ · · · ⊕ K[X]/(qnK[X]),
and by Proposition 35.32, E[X]/Im(X1 − f) is isomorphic to a direct sum
E[X]/Im(X1 − f) ≈ K[X]/(p1K[X]) ⊕ · · · ⊕ K[X]/(pnK[X]),
36.2. THE RATIONAL CANONICAL FORM 1299
where p1, . . . , pn are the invariant factors of Im(X1 − f) with respect to E[X]. Since Ef ≈
E[X]/Im(X1 − f), by the uniqueness part of Theorem 35.31 and because the polynomials
are monic, we must have pi = qi
, for i = 1, . . . , n. Therefore, we proved the following crucial
fact:
Proposition 36.11. For any linear map f : E → E over a K-vector space E of dimension
n, the similarity invariants of f are equal to the invariant factors of Im(X1−f) with respect
to E[X].
Proposition 36.11 is the key to computing the similarity invariants of a linear map. This
can be done using a procedure to convert XI − M to its Smith normal form. Propositions
36.11 and 35.37 yield the following result.
Proposition 36.12. For any linear map f : E → E over a K-vector space E of dimension
n, if (q1, . . . , qn) are the similarity invariants of f, for any matrix M representing f with
respect to any basis, then for k = 1, . . . , n the product
dk(X) = q1(X)· · · qk(X)
is the gcd of the k × k-minors of the matrix XI − M.
Note that the matrix XI −M is none other than the matrix that yields the characteristic
polynomial χf (X) = det(XI − M) of f.
Proposition 36.13. For any linear map f : E → E over a K-vector space E of dimension
n, if (q1, . . . , qn) are the similarity invariants of f, then the following properties hold:
(1) If χf (X) is the characteristic polynomial of f, then
χf (X) = q1(X)· · · qn(X).
(2) The minimal polynomial m(X) = qn(X) of f divides the characteristic polynomial
χf (X) of f.
(3) The characteristic polynomial χf (X) divides m(X)
n
.
(4) E is cyclic for f iff m(X) = χf (X).
Proof. Property (1) follows from Proposition 36.12 for k = n. It also follows from Theorem
36.6 and the fact that for the companion matrix associated with qi
, the characteristic poly￾nomial of this matrix is also qi
. Property (2) is obvious from (1). Since each qi divides qi+1,
each qi divides qn, so their product χf (X) divides m(X)
n = qn(X)
n
. The last condition says
that q1 = · · · = qn−1 = 1, which means that Ef has a single summand.
Observe that Proposition 36.13 yields another proof of the Cayley–Hamilton Theorem.
It also implies that a linear map is nilpotent iff its characteristic polynomial is Xn

36.3 The Rational Canonical Form, Second Version
Let us now translate the Elementary Divisors Decomposition Theorem, Theorem 35.38, in
terms of Ef . We obtain the following result.
Theorem 36.14. (Cyclic Decomposition Theorem, Second Version) Let f : E → E be an
endomorphism on a K-vector space of dimension n. Then, E is the direct sum of of cyclic
subspaces Ej = Z(uj
; f) for f, such that the minimal polynomial of Ej is of the form p
n
i
i,j
,
for some irreducible monic polynomials p1, . . . , pt ∈ K[X] and some positive integers ni,j ,
such that for each i = 1, . . . , t, there is a sequence of integers
1 ≤ n
|i,1, . . . , ni,1

,
with si ≥ 1, and where ni,j occurs mi,j ≥ 1 times, for j = 1, . . . , si. Furthermore, the monic
polynomials pi and the integers r, t, ni,j , si, mi,j are uniquely determined.
Note that there are µ =
P mi,j cyclic subspaces Z(uj
; f). Using bases for the cyclic
subspaces Z(uj
; f) as in Theorem 36.6, we get the following theorem.
Theorem 36.15. (Rational Canonical Form, Second Version) Let f : E → E be an en￾domorphism on a K-vector space of dimension n. There exist t distinct irreducible monic
polynomials p1, . . . , pt ∈ K[X] and some positive integers ni,j , such that for each i = 1, . . . , t,
there is a sequence of integers

with si ≥ 1, and where ni,j occurs mi,j ≥ 1 times, for j = 1, . . . , si, and there is a basis of E
such that the matrix M of f is a block matrix of the form
M =

,
where each Mj is the companion matrix of some p
n
i
i,j , and µ =
P mi,j . The monic polyno￾mials p1, . . . , pt and the integers r, t, ni,j , si, mi,j are uniquely determined
The polynomials p
n
i
i,j are called the elementary divisors of f (and M). These polynomials
are factors of the minimal polynomial.
Example 1 continued: Recall that f(x, y, z, w) = (x + w, y + z, y + z, x + w) has
two nontrivial invariant factors q1 = x(x − 2) = q2. Thus the elementary factors of f are
p1 = x = p2 and p3 = x − 2 = p4. Theorem 36.14 implies that
R
4 = E1 ⊕ E2 ⊕ E3 ⊕ E4,
36.4. THE JORDAN FORM REVISITED 1301
where E1 = Z(u1, f) ∼= R[X]/(X), E2 = Z(u2, f) ∼= R[X]/(X), E3 = Z(u3, f) ∼= R[X]/(X −
2), and E4 = Z(u4, f) ∼= R[X]/(X − 2). The subspaces E1 and E2 correspond to one￾dimensional spaces spanned by eigenvectors associated with eigenvalue 0, while E3 and E4
correspond to one-dimensional spaces spanned by eigenvectors associated with eigenvalue 2.
If we let u1 = (−1, 0, 0, 1), u2 = (0, −1, 1, 0), u3 = (1, 0, 0, 1) and u4 = (0, 1, 1, 0), Theorem
36.15 gives

as the rational canonical form associated with the cyclic decomposition R
4 = E1 ⊕E2 ⊕E3 ⊕
E4.
As we pointed earlier, unlike the similarity invariants, the elementary divisors may change
when we pass to a field extension.
We will now consider the special case where all the irreducible polynomials pi are of the
form X − λi
; that is, when are the eigenvalues of f belong to K. In this case, we find again
the Jordan form.
36.4 The Jordan Form Revisited
In this section, we assume that all the roots of the minimal polynomial of f belong to K.
This will be the case if K is algebraically closed. The irreducible polynomials pi of Theorem
36.14 are the polynomials X − λi
, for the distinct eigenvalues λi of f. Then, each cyclic
subspace Z(uj
; f) has a minimal polynomial of the form (X − λ)
m, for some eigenvalue λ of
f and some m ≥ 1. It turns out that by choosing a suitable basis for the cyclic subspace
Z(uj
; f), the matrix of the restriction of f to Z(uj
; f) is a Jordan block.
Proposition 36.16. Let E be a finite-dimensional K-vector space and let f : E → E be a
linear map. If E is a cyclic K[X]-module and if (X − λ)
n
is the minimal polynomial of f,
then there is a basis of E of the form
((f − λid)n−1
(u),(f − λid)n−2
(u), . . . ,(f − λid)(u), u),
for some u ∈ E. With respect to this basis, the matrix of f is the Jordan block
