⊥ would yield
(W + U
⊥)
⊥ ⊆ W⊥⊥,
that is,
W⊥ ∩ U ⊆ W,
29.7. WITT DECOMPOSITION 1027
thus W⊥ ∩ U ⊆ W ∩ U, and since U is totally isotropic, U ⊆ U
⊥, which yields
W⊥ ∩ U ⊆ W ∩ U ⊆ W ∩ U
⊥ = (0),
contradicting the fact that U ∩ W⊥ 6 = (0).
Therefore, there is some u ∈ W⊥ such that u /∈ W +U
⊥. Since U ⊆ U
⊥, we can add to u
any vector z ∈ W⊥ ∩ U ⊆ U
⊥ so that u + z ∈ W⊥ and u + z /∈ W + U
⊥ (if u + z ∈ W + U
⊥,
since z ∈ U
⊥, then u ∈ W + U
⊥, a contradiction). Since W⊥ ∩ U 6 = (0) is totally isotropic
and u /∈ W + U
⊥ = (W⊥ ∩ U)
⊥, we can invoke Lemma 29.28 to find a z ∈ W⊥ ∩ U such
that ϕ(u + z, u + z) = 0. See Figure 29.1. If we write x = u + z, then x /∈ W + U
⊥, so
W0 = W + Kx is a totally isotropic subspace of dimension s + 1. Furthermore, we claim
that W0 ∩ U
⊥ = 0.

Otherwise, we would have y = w + λx ∈ U
⊥, for some w ∈ W and some λ ∈ K, and
then we would have λx = −w + y ∈ W + U
⊥. If λ 6 = 0, then x ∈ W + U
⊥, a contradiction.
Therefore, λ = 0, y = w, and since y ∈ U
⊥ and w ∈ W, we have y ∈ W ∩ U
⊥ = (0), which
means that y = 0. Therefore, W0 is the required subspace and this completes the proof.
Here are some consequences of Proposition 29.29. If we set W = (0) in Proposition
29.29(2), then we get the following theorem showing that if E is not anisotropic (there is
some nonzero isotropic vector) then weak nontrivial Witt decompositions exist.
Theorem 29.30. Let ϕ be an  -Hermitian form on E which is nondegenerate and satisfies
property (T). For any totally isotropic subspace U of E of finite dimension r ≥ 1, there
exists a totally isotropic subspace U
0 of dimension r such that U ∩ U
0 = (0) and U ⊕ U
0 is
nondegenerate. As a consequence, if E is not anisotropic, then (U, U0 ,(U ⊕ U
0 )
⊥) is a weak
nontrivial Witt decomposition for E. Furthermore, by Proposition 29.29(1), the block A in
the matrix of ϕ is the identity matrix.
1028 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
Proposition 29.31. Any two  -Hermitian neutral forms satisfying property (T) defined on
spaces of the same dimension are equivalent.
The following proposition shows that every subspace U of E can be embedded into a
nondegenerate subspace. It is needed to prove a version of the Witt extension theorem
(Theorem 29.48).
Proposition 29.32. Let ϕ be an  -Hermitian form on E which is nondegenerate and satisfies
property (T). For any subspace U of E of finite dimension, if we write
U = V
⊥
⊕ W,
for some orthogonal complement W of V = rad(U), and if we let r = dim(rad(U)), then
there exists a totally isotropic subspace V
0 of dimension r such that V ∩ V
0 = (0), and
(V ⊕ V
0 )
⊥
⊕ W = V
0 ⊕ U is nondegenerate. Furthermore, any isometry f from U into
another space (E
0 , ϕ0 ) where ϕ
0 is an  -Hermitian form satisfying the same assumptions as
ϕ can be extended to an isometry on (V ⊕ V
0 )
⊥
⊕ W.
Proof. Since W is nondegenerate, W⊥ is also nondegenerate, and V ⊆ W⊥. Therefore, we
can apply Theorem 29.30 to the restriction of ϕ to W⊥ and to V to obtain the required V
0 .
We know that V ⊕ V
0 is nondegenerate and orthogonal to W, which is also nondegenerate,
so (V ⊕ V
0 )
⊥
⊕ W = V
0 ⊕ U is nondegenerate.
We leave the second statement about extending f as an exercise (use the fact that f(U) =
f(V )
⊥
⊕ f(W), where V1 = f(V ) is totally isotropic of dimension r, to find another totally
isotropic susbpace V1
0
of dimension r such that V1 ∩ V1
0 = (0) and V1 ⊕ V1
0
is orthogonal to
f(W)).
The subspace (V ⊕ V
0 )
⊥
⊕ W = V
0 ⊕ U is often called a nondegenerate completion of U.
The subspace V ⊕ V
0 is called an Artinian space. Proposition 29.29 show that V ⊕ V
0 has
a basis (u1, v1, . . . , ur, vr) consisting of vectors ui ∈ V and vj ∈ V
0 such that ϕ(ui
, uj ) = δij .
The subspace spanned by (ui
, vi) is an Artinian plane, so V ⊕ V
0 is the orthogonal direct
sum of r Artinian planes. Such a space is often denoted by Ar2r.
In order to obtain the stronger version of the Witt decomposition when ϕ has some
nonzero isotropic vector and W is anisotropic we now sharpen Proposition 29.29
Theorem 29.33. Let ϕ be an  -Hermitian form on E which is nondegenerate and satisfies
property (T). Let U1 and U2 be two totally isotropic maximal subspaces of E, with U1 or U2
of finite dimension ≥ 1. Write U = U1 ∩ U2, let S1 be a supplement of U in U1 and S2 be
a supplement of U in U2 (so that U1 = U ⊕ S1, U2 = U ⊕ S2), and let S = S1 + S2. Then,
there exist two subspaces W and D of E such that:
(a) The subspaces S, U + W, and D are nondegenerate and pairwise orthogonal.
29.7. WITT DECOMPOSITION 1029
(b) We have a direct sum E = S
⊥
⊕ (U ⊕ W)
⊥
⊕ D.
(c) The subspace D contains no nonzero isotropic vector (D is anisotropic).
(d) The subspace W is totally isotropic.
Furthermore, U1 and U2 are both finite dimensional, and we have dim(U1) = dim(U2),
dim(W) = dim(U), dim(S1) = dim(S2), and codim(D) = 2 dim(F1).
Proof. First observe that if X is a totally isotropic maximal subspace of E, then any isotropic
vector x ∈ E orthogonal to X must belong to X, since otherwise, X + Kx would be a
totally isotropic subspace strictly containing X, contradicting the maximality of X. As a
consequence, if xi
is any isotropic vector such that xi ∈ Ui
⊥ (for i = 1, 2), then xi ∈ Ui
.
We claim that
S1 ∩ S2
⊥ = (0) and S2 ∩ S1
⊥ = (0).
Assume that y ∈ S1 is orthogonal to S2. Since U1 = U ⊕ S1 and U1 is totally isotropic, y is
orthogonal to U1, and thus orthogonal to U, so that y is orthogonal to U2 = U ⊕ S2. Since
S1 ⊆ U1 and U1 is totally isotropic, y is an isotropic vector orthogonal to U2, which by a
previous remark implies that y ∈ U2. Then, since S1 ⊆ U1 and U ⊕ S1 is a direct sum, we
have
y ∈ S1 ∩ U2 = S1 ∩ U1 ∩ U2 = S1 ∩ U = (0).
Therefore S1∩S2
⊥ = (0). A similar proof show that S2∩S1
⊥ = (0). If U1 is finite-dimensional
(the case where U2 is finite-dimensional is similar), then S1 is finite-dimensional, so by
Proposition 29.13, S1
⊥ has finite codimension. Since S2∩S1
⊥ = (0), and since any supplement
of S1
⊥ has finite dimension, we must have
dim(S2) ≤ codim(S1
⊥) = dim(S1).
By a similar argument, dim(S1) ≤ dim(S2), so we have
dim(S1) = dim(S2).
By Proposition 29.29(1), we conclude that S = S1 + S2 is nondegenerate.
By Proposition 29.21, the subspace N = S
⊥ = (S1 + S2)
⊥ is nondegenerate. Since
U1 = U ⊕ S1, U2 = U ⊕ S2, and U1, U2 are totally isotropic, U is orthogonal to S1 and to
S2, so U ⊆ N. Since U is totally isotropic, by Proposition 29.30 applied to N, there is a
totally isotropic subspace W of N such that dim(W) = dim(U), U ∩ W = (0), and U + W
is nondegenerate. Consequently, (d) is satisfied by W.
To satisfy (a) and (b), we pick D to be the orthogonal of U ⊕ W in N. Then, N =
(U ⊕ W)
⊥
⊕ D and E = S
⊥
⊕ N, so E = S
⊥
⊕ (U ⊕ W)
⊥
⊕ D.
As to (c), since D is orthogonal U ⊕ W, D is orthogonal to U, and since D ⊆ N and N
is orthogonal to S1 + S2, D is orthogonal to S1, so D is orthogonal to U1 = U ⊕ S1. If y ∈ D
1030 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
is any isotropic vector, since y ∈ U1
⊥, by a previous remark, y ∈ U1, so y ∈ D ∩ U1. But,
D ⊆ N with N ∩ (S1 + S2) = (0), and D ∩ (U + W) = (0), so D ∩ (U + S1) = D ∩ U1 = (0),
which yields y = 0. The statements about dimensions are easily obtained.
Finally, Theorem 29.33 yields the strong form of the Witt decomposition in which W
is anistropic. Given any matrix A ∈ Mn(K), we say that A is definite if x
> Ax 6 = 0 for all
x ∈ Kn
.
Theorem 29.34. Let ϕ be an  -Hermitian form on E which is nondegenerate and satisfies
property (T).
(1) Any two totally isotropic maximal spaces of finite dimension have the same dimension.
(2) For any totally isotropic maximal subspace U of finite dimension r ≥ 1, there is an￾other totally isotropic maximal subspace U
0 of dimension r such that U ∩ U
0 = (0),
and U ⊕ U
0 is nondegenerate. Furthermore, if D = (U ⊕ U
0 )
⊥, then (U, U0 , D) is a
Witt decomposition of E; that is, there are no nonzero isotropic vectors in D (D is
anisotropic).
(3) If E has finite dimension n ≥ 1 and there is some nonzero isotropic vector for ϕ (E
is not anisotropic), then E has a nontrivial Witt decomposition (U, U0 , D) as in (2).
There is a basis of E such that
(a) if ϕ is alternating ( = −1 and λ = λ for all λ ∈ K), then n = 2m and ϕ is
represented by a matrix of the form

0 Im
−Im 0

(b) if ϕ is symmetric ( = +1 and λ = λ for all λ ∈ K), then ϕ is represented by a
matrix of the form


0 Ir 0
Ir 0 0
0 0 P

 ,
where either n = 2r and P does not occur, or n > 2r and P is a definite symmetric
matrix.
(c) if ϕ is  -Hermitian (the involutive automorphism λ 7→ λ is not the identity), then
ϕ is represented by a matrix of the form


0 Ir 0
Ir 0 0
0 0 P

 ,
where either n = 2r and P does not occur, or n > 2r and P is a definite matrix
such that P
∗ = P.
29.7. WITT DECOMPOSITION 1031
Proof. Part (1) follows from Theorem 29.33. By Proposition 29.30, we obtain a totally
isotropic subspace U
0 of dimension r such that U ∩ U
0 = (0). By applying Theorem 29.33
to U1 = U and U2 = U
0 , we get U = W = (0), which proves (2). Part (3) is an immediate
consequence of (2).
As a consequence of Theorem 29.34, we make the following definition.
Definition 29.19. Let E be a vector space of finite dimension n, and let ϕ be an  -Hermitian
form on E which is nondegenerate and satisfies property (T). The index (or Witt index ) ν
of ϕ, is the common dimension of all totally isotropic maximal subspaces of E. We have
2ν ≤ n.
Neutral forms only exist if n is even, in which case, ν = n/2. Forms of index ν = 0
have no nonzero isotropic vectors. When K = R, this is satisfied by positive definite or
negative definite symmetric forms. When K = C, this is satisfied by positive definite or
negative definite Hermitian forms. The vector space of a neutral Hermitian form ( = +1) is
an Artinian space, and the vector space of a neutral alternating form is a hyperbolic space.
If the field K is algebraically closed, we can describe all nondegenerate quadratic forms.
Proposition 29.35. If K is algebraically closed and E has dimension n, then for every
nondegenerate quadratic form Φ, there is a basis (e1, . . . , en) such that Φ is given by
Φ


m
i=1 xixm+i if n = 2m
P

i=1 xixm+i + x

2m+1 if n = 2m + 1.
Proof. We work with the polar form ϕ of Φ. Let U1 and U2 be some totally isotropic
subspaces such that U1 ∩ U2 = (0) given by Theorem 29.34, and let q be their common
dimension. Then, W = U = (0). Since we can pick bases (e1, . . . eq) in U1 and (eq+1, . . . , e2q)
in U2 such that ϕ(ei
, ei+q) = 0, for i, j = 1, . . . , q, it suffices to proves that dim(D) ≤ 1. If
x, y ∈ D with x 6 = 0, from the identity
Φ(y − λx) = Φ(y) − λϕ(x, y) + λ
2Φ(x)
and the fact that Φ(x) 6 = 0 since x ∈ D and x 6 = 0, we see that the equation Φ(y − λy) = 0
has at least one solution. Since Φ(z) 6 = 0 for every nonzero z ∈ D, we get y = λx, and thus
dim(D) ≤ 1, as claimed.
Proposition 29.35 shows that for every nondegenerate quadratic form Φ over an alge￾braically closed field, if dim(E) = 2m or dim(E) = 2m + 1 with m ≥ 1, then Φ has some
nonzero isotropic vector.
1032 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
29.8 Symplectic Groups
In this section, we are dealing with a nondegenerate alternating form ϕ on a vector space E
of dimension n. As we saw earlier, n must be even, say n = 2m. By Theorem 29.24, there
is a direct sum decomposition of E into pairwise orthogonal subspaces
E = W1
⊥
⊕ · · ·
⊥
⊕ Wm,
where each Wi
is a hyperbolic plane. Each Wi has a basis (ui
, vi), with ϕ(ui
, ui) = ϕ(vi
, vi) =
0 and ϕ(ui
, vi) = 1, for i = 1, . . . , m. In the basis
(u1, . . . , um, v1, . . . , vm),
ϕ is represented by the matrix
Jm,m =

0 Im
−Im 0

.
The symplectic group Sp(2m, K) is the group of isometries of ϕ. The maps in Sp(2m, K)
are called symplectic maps. With respect to the above basis, Sp(2m, K) is the group of
2m × 2m matrices A such that
A
> Jm,mA = Jm,m.
Matrices satisfying the above identity are called symplectic matrices. In this section, we show
that Sp(2m, K) is a subgroup of SL(2m, K) (that is, det(A) = +1 for all A ∈ Sp(2m, K)),
and we show that Sp(2m, K) is generated by special linear maps called symplectic transvec￾tions.
First, we leave it as an easy exercise to show that Sp(2, K) = SL(2, K). The reader
should also prove that Sp(2m, K) has a subgroup isomorphic to GL(m, K).
Next we characterize the symplectic maps f that leave fixed every vector in some given
hyperplane H, that is,
f(v) = v for all v ∈ H.
Since ϕ is nondegenerate, by Proposition 29.22, the orthogonal H⊥ of H is a line (that is,
dim(H⊥) = 1). For every u ∈ E and every v ∈ H, since f is an isometry and f(v) = v for
all v ∈ H, we have
ϕ(f(u) − u, v) = ϕ(f(u), v) − ϕ(u, v)
= ϕ(f(u), v) − ϕ(f(u), f(v))
= ϕ(f(u), v − f(v)))
= ϕ(f(u), 0) = 0,
which shows that f(u) − u ∈ H⊥ for all u ∈ E. Therefore, f − id is a linear map from E
into the line H⊥ whose kernel contains H, which means that there is some nonzero vector
w ∈ H⊥ and some linear form ψ such that
f(u) = u + ψ(u)w, u ∈ E.
29.8. SYMPLECTIC GROUPS 1033
Since f is an isometry, we must have ϕ(f(u), f(v)) = ϕ(u, v) for all u, v ∈ E, which means
that
ϕ(u, v) = ϕ(f(u), f(v))
= ϕ(u + ψ(u)w, v + ψ(v)w)
= ϕ(u, v) + ψ(u)ϕ(w, v) + ψ(v)ϕ(u, w) + ψ(u)ψ(v)ϕ(w, w)
= ϕ(u, v) + ψ(u)ϕ(w, v) − ψ(v)ϕ(w, u),
which yields
ψ(u)ϕ(w, v) = ψ(v)ϕ(w, u) for all u, v ∈ E.
Since ϕ is nondegenerate, we can pick some v0 such that ϕ(w, v0) 6 = 0, and we get
ψ(u)ϕ(w, v0) = ψ(v0)ϕ(w, u) for all u ∈ E; that is,
ψ(u) = λϕ(w, u) for all u ∈ E,
for some λ ∈ K. Therefore, f is of the form
f(u) = u + λϕ(w, u)w, for all u ∈ E.
It is also clear that every f of the above form is a symplectic map. If λ = 0, then f = id.
Otherwise, if λ 6 = 0, then f(u) = u iff ϕ(w, u) = 0 iff u ∈ (Kw)
⊥ = H, where H is a
hyperplane. Thus, f fixes every vector in the hyperplane H. Note that since ϕ is alternating,
ϕ(w, w) = 0, which means that w ∈ H.
In summary, we have characterized all the symplectic maps that leave every vector in
some hyperplane fixed, and we make the following definition.
Definition 29.20. Given a nondegenerate alternating form ϕ on a space E, a symplectic
transvection (of direction w) is a linear map f of the form
f(u) = u + λϕ(w, u)w, for all u ∈ E,
for some nonzero w ∈ E and some λ ∈ K. If λ 6 = 0, the subspace of vectors left fixed by f
is the hyperplane H = (Kw)
⊥. The map f is also denoted τw,λ.
Observe that
τw,λ ◦ τw,µ = τw,λ+µ
and τw,λ = id iff λ = 0. The above shows that det(τw,λ) = 1, since when λ 6 = 0, we have
τw,λ = (τw,λ/2)
2
.
Our next goal is to show that if u and v are any two nonzero vectors in E, then there is
a simple symplectic map f such that f(u) = v.
Proposition 29.36. Given any two nonzero vectors u, v ∈ E, there is a symplectic map
f such that f(u) = v, and f is either a symplectic transvection, or the composition of two
symplectic transvections.
1034 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
Proof. There are two cases.
Case 1 . ϕ(u, v) 6 = 0.
In this case, u 6 = v, since ϕ(u, u) = 0. Let us look for a symplectic transvection of the
form τv−u,λ. We want
v = u + λϕ(v − u, u)(v − u) = u + λϕ(v, u)(v − u),
which yields
(λϕ(v, u) − 1)(v − u) = 0.
Since ϕ(u, v) 6 = 0 and ϕ(v, u) = −ϕ(u, v), we can pick λ = ϕ(v, u)
−1 and τv−u,λ maps u to v.
Case 2 . ϕ(u, v) = 0.
If u = v, use τu,0 = id. Now, assume u 6 = v. We claim that it is possible to pick some
w ∈ E such that ϕ(u, w) 6 = 0 and ϕ(v, w) 6 = 0. Indeed, if (Ku)
⊥ = (Kv)
⊥, then pick any
nonzero vector w not in the hyperplane (Ku)
⊥. Othwerwise, (Ku)
⊥ and (Kv)
⊥ are two
distinct hyperplanes, so neither is contained in the other (they have the same dimension),
so pick any nonzero vector w1 such that w1 ∈ (Ku)
⊥ and w1 ∈/ (Kv)
⊥, and pick any
nonzero vector w2 such that w2 ∈ (Kv)
⊥ and w2 ∈/ (Ku)
⊥. If we let w = w1 + w2, then
ϕ(u, w) = ϕ(u, w2) 6 = 0, and ϕ(v, w) = ϕ(v, w1) 6 = 0. From case 1, we have some symplectic
transvection τw−u,λ1
such that τw−u,λ1
(u) = w, and some symplectic transvection τv−w,λ2
such
that τv−w,λ2
(w) = v, so the composition τv−w,λ2 ◦ τw−u,λ1 maps u to v.
Next, we would like to extend Proposition 29.36 to two hyperbolic planes W1 and W2.
Proposition 29.37. Given any two hyperbolic planes W1 and W2 given by bases (u1, v1) and
(u2, v2) (with ϕ(ui
, ui) = ϕ(vi
, vi) = 0 and ϕ(ui
, vi) = 1, for i = 1, 2), there is a symplectic
map f such that f(u1) = u2, f(v1) = v2, and f is the composition of at most four symplectic
transvections.
Proof. From Proposition 29.36, we can map u1 to u2, using a map f which is the composition
of at most two symplectic transvections. Say v3 = f(v1). We claim that there is a map g
such that g(u2) = u2 and g(v3) = v2, and g is the composition of at most two symplectic
transvections. If so, g ◦ f maps the pair (u1, v1) to the pair (u2, v2), and g ◦ f consists of at
most four symplectic transvections. Thus, we need to prove the following claim:
Claim. If (u, v) and (u, v0 ) are hyperbolic bases determining two hyperbolic planes, then
there is a symplectic map g such that g(u) = u, g(v) = v
0 , and g is the composition of at
most two symplectic transvections. There are two case.
Case 1 . ϕ(v, v0 ) 6 = 0.
In this case, there is a symplectic transvection τv
0 −v,λ such that τv
0 −v,λ(v) = v
0 . We also
have
ϕ(u, v0 − v) = ϕ(u, v0 ) − ϕ(u, v) = 1 − 1 = 0.
29.8. SYMPLECTIC GROUPS 1035
Therefore, τv
0 −v,λ(u) = u, and g = τv
0 −v,λ does the job.
Case 2 . ϕ(v, v0 ) = 0.
First, check that (u, u + v) is a also hyperbolic basis. Furthermore,
ϕ(v, u + v) = ϕ(v, u) + ϕ(v, v) = ϕ(v, u) = −1 6 = 0.
Thus, there is a symplectic transvection τv,λ1
such that τu,λ1
(v) = u + v and τu,λ1
(u) = u.
We also have
ϕ(u + v, v0 ) = ϕ(u, v0 ) + ϕ(v, v0 ) = ϕ(u, v0 ) = 1 6 = 0,
so there is a symplectic transvection τv
0 −u−v,λ2
such that τv
0 −u−v,λ2
(u + v) = v
0 . Since
ϕ(u, v0 − u − v) = ϕ(u, v0 ) − ϕ(u, u) − ϕ(u, v) = 1 − 0 − 1 = 0,
we have τv
0 −u−v,λ2
(u) = u. Then, the composition g = τv
0 −u−v,λ2 ◦ τu,λ1
is such that g(u) = u
and g(v) = v
0 .
We will use Proposition 29.37 in an inductive argument to prove that the symplectic
transvections generate the symplectic group. First, make the following observation: If U is
a nondegenerate subspace of E, so that
E = U
⊥
⊕ U
⊥,
and if τ is a transvection of H⊥, then we can form the linear map idU
⊥
⊕ τ whose restriction
to U is the identity and whose restriction to U
⊥ is τ , and idU
⊥
⊕ τ is a transvection of E.
Theorem 29.38. The symplectic group Sp(2m, K) is generated by the symplectic transvec￾tions. For every transvection f ∈ Sp(2m, K), we have det(f) = 1.
Proof. Let G be the subgroup of Sp(2m, K) generated by the transvections. We need to
prove that G = Sp(2m, K). Let (u1, v1, . . . , um, vm) be a symplectic basis of E, and let f ∈
Sp(2m, K) be any symplectic map. Then, f maps (u1, v1, . . . , um, vm) to another symplectic
basis (u
01
, v1
0
, . . . , u0m, vm
0). If we prove that there is some g ∈ G such that g(ui) = u
0i
and
g(vi) = vi
0
for i = 1, . . . , m, then f = g and G = Sp(2m, K).
We use induction on i to prove that there is some gi ∈ G so that gi maps (u1, v1, . . . , ui
, vi)
to (u
01
, v1
0
, . . . , u0i
, vi
0
).
The base case i = 1 follows from Proposition 29.37.
For the induction step, assume that we have some gi ∈ G mapping (u1, v1, . . . , ui
, vi)
to (u
01
, v1
0
, . . . , u0i
, vi

), and let (u
00i+1, vi
00+1, . . . , u00m, vm
00) be the image of (ui+1, vi+1, . . . , um, vm)
by gi
. If U is the subspace spanned by (u

U
⊥. Using the remark before the theorem and Proposition 29.37, we can find a transvec￾tion τ mapping Wi
00+1 onto Wi
0+1 and leaving every vector in U fixed. Then, τ ◦ gi maps
(u1, v1, . . . , ui+1, vi+1) to (u
01
, v1
0
, . . . , u0i+1, vi
0+1), establishing the induction step.
For the second statement, since we already proved that every transvection has a deter￾minant equal to +1, this also holds for any composition of transvections in G, and since
G = Sp(2m, K), we are done.
It can also be shown that the center of Sp(2m, K) is reduced to the subgroup {id, −id}.
The projective symplectic group PSp(2m, K) is the quotient group PSp(2m, K)/{id, −id}.
All symplectic projective groups are simple, except PSp(2, F2), PSp(2, F3), and PSp(4, F2),
see Grove [83].
The orders of the symplectic groups over finite fields can be determined. For details, see
Artin [6], Jacobson [98] and Grove [83].
An interesting property of symplectic spaces is that the determinant of a skew-symmetric
matrix B is the square of some polynomial Pf(B) called the Pfaffian; see Jacobson [98] and
Artin [6]. We leave considerations of the Pfaffian to the exercises.
We now take a look at the orthogonal groups.
29.9 Orthogonal Groups and the Cartan–Dieudonn´e
Theorem
In this section we are dealing with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear from ϕ over a finite￾dimensional vector space E of dimension n over a field of characateristic not equal to 2.
Recall that the orthogonal group O(ϕ) is the group of isometries of ϕ; that is, the group of
linear maps f : E → E such that
ϕ(f(u), f(v)) = ϕ(u, v) for all u, v ∈ E.
The elements of O(ϕ) are also called orthogonal transformations. If M is the matrix of ϕ in
any basis, then a matrix A represents an orthogonal transformation iff
A
> MA = M.
Since ϕ is nondegenerate, M is invertible, so we see that det(A) = ±1. The subgroup
SO(ϕ) = {f ∈ O(ϕ) | det(f) = 1}
is called the special orthogonal group (of ϕ), and its members are called rotations (or proper
orthogonal transformations). Isometries f ∈ O(ϕ) such that det(f) = −1 are called improper
orthogonal transformations, or sometimes reversions.
29.9. ORTHOGONAL GROUPS AND THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM ´ 1037
If H is any nondegenerate hyperplane in E, then D = H⊥ is a nondegenerate line and
we have
E = H
⊥
⊕ H
⊥.
For any nonzero vector u ∈ D = H⊥ Consider the map τu given by
τu(v) = v − 2
ϕ(v, u)
ϕ(u, u)
u for all v ∈ E.
If we replace u by λu with λ 6 = 0, we have
τλu(v) = v − 2
ϕ(v, λu)
ϕ(λu, λu)
λu = v − 2
λϕ(v, u)
λ
2ϕ(u, u)
λu = v − 2
ϕ(v, u)
ϕ(u, u)
u,
which shows that τu depends only on the line D, and thus only the hyperplane H. Therefore,
denote by τH the linear map τu determined as above by any nonzero vector u ∈ H⊥. Note
that if v ∈ H, then
τH(v) = v,
and if v ∈ D, then
τH(v) = −v.
A simple computation shows that
ϕ(τH(u), τH(v)) = ϕ(u, v) for all u, v ∈ E,
so τH ∈ O(ϕ), and by picking a basis consisting of u and vectors in H, that det(τH) = −1.
It is also clear that τH
2 = id.
Definition 29.21. If H is any nondegenerate hyperplane in E, for any nonzero vector
u ∈ H⊥, the linear map τH given by
τH(v) = v − 2
ϕ(v, u)
ϕ(u, u)
u for all v ∈ E
is an involutive isometry of E called the reflection through (or about) the hyperplane H.
Remarks:
1. It can be shown that if f ∈ O(ϕ) leaves every vector in some hyperplane H fixed, then
either f = id or f = τH; see Taylor [174] (Chapter 11). Thus, there is no analog to
symplectic transvections in the orthogonal group.
2. If K = R and ϕ is the usual Euclidean inner product, the matrices corresponding to
hyperplane reflections are called Householder matrices.
Our goal is to prove that O(ϕ) is generated by the hyperplane reflections. The following
proposition is needed.
1038 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
Proposition 29.39. Let ϕ be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on a vector space
E. For any two nonzero vectors u, v ∈ E, if ϕ(u, u) = ϕ(v, v) and v − u is nonisotropic,
then the hyperplane reflection τH = τv−u maps u to v, with H = (K(v − u))⊥.
Proof. Since v − u is not isotropic, ϕ(v − u, v − u) 6 = 0, and we have
τv−u(u) = u − 2
ϕ(u, v − u)
ϕ(v − u, v − u)
(v − u)
= u − 2
ϕ(u, v) − ϕ(u, u)
ϕ(v, v) − 2ϕ(u, v) + ϕ(u, u)
(v − u)
= u −
2(ϕ(u, v) − ϕ(u, u))
2(ϕ(u, u) − 2ϕ(u, v))(v − u)
= v,
which proves the proposition.
We can now obtain a cheap version of the Cartan–Dieudonn´e theorem.
Theorem 29.40. (Cartan–Dieudonn´e, weak form) Let ϕ be a nondegenerate symmetric
bilinear form on a K-vector space E of dimension n (char(K) 6 = 2). Then, every isometry
f ∈ O(ϕ) with f 6 = id is the composition of at most 2n − 1 hyperplane reflections.
Proof. We proceed by induction on n. For n = 0, this is trivial (since O(ϕ) = {id}).
Next, assume that n ≥ 1. Since ϕ is nondegenerate, we know that there is some non￾isotropic vector u ∈ E. There are three cases.
Case 1 . f(u) = u.
Since ϕ is nondegenrate and u is nonisotropic, the hyperplane H = (Ku)
⊥ is nondegen￾erate, E = H
⊥
⊕ Ku, and since f(u) = u, we must have f(H) = H. The restriction f
0 of of
f to H is an isometry of H. By the induction hypothesis, we can write
f
0 = τk
0 ◦ · · · ◦ τ1
0
,
where τi
is some hyperplane reflection about a hyperplane Li
in H, with k ≤ 2n − 3. We
can extend each τi
0
to a reflection τi about the hyperplane Li
⊥
⊕ Ku so that τi(u) = u, and
clearly,
f = τk ◦ · · · ◦ τ1.
Case 2 . f(u) = −u.
If τ is the hyperplane reflection about the hyperplane H = (Ku)
⊥, then g = τ ◦ f is an
isometry of E such that g(u) = u, and we are back to Case (1). Since τ
2 = 1 We obtain
f = τ ◦ τk ◦ · · · ◦ τ1
29.9. ORTHOGONAL GROUPS AND THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM ´ 1039
where τ and the τi are hyperplane reflections, with k ≥ 2n − 3, and we get a total of 2n − 2
hyperplane reflections.
Case 3 . f(u) 6 = u and f(u) 6 = −u.
Note that f(u) − u and f(u) + u are orthogonal, since
ϕ(f(u) − u, f(u) + u) = ϕ(f(u), f(u)) + ϕ(f(u), u) − ϕ(u, f(u)) − ϕ(u, u)
= ϕ(u, u) − ϕ(u, u) = 0.
We also have
ϕ(u, u) = ϕ((f(u) + u − (f(u) − u))/2,(f(u) + u − (f(u) − u))/2)
=
1
4
ϕ(f(u) + u, f(u) + u) + 1
4
ϕ(f(u) − u, f(u) − u),
so f(u) + u and f(u) − u cannot be both isotropic, since u is not isotropic.
If f(u) − u is not isotropic, then the reflection τf(u)−u is such that
τf(u)−u(u) = f(u),
and since τf
2
(u)−u = id, if g = τf(u)−u ◦ f, then g(u) = u, and we are back to case (1). We
obtain
f = τf(u)−u ◦ τk ◦ · · · ◦ τ1
where τf(u)−u and the τi are hyperplane reflections, with k ≥ 2n − 3, and we get a total of
2n − 2 hyperplane reflections.
If f(u) + u is not isotropic, then the reflection τf(u)+u is such that
τf(u)+u(u) = −f(u),
and since τf
2
(u)+u = id, if g = τf(u)+u ◦ f, then g(u) = −u, and we are back to case (2). We
obtain
f = τf(u)−u ◦ τ ◦ τk ◦ · · · ◦ τ1
where τ, τf(u)−u and the τi are hyperplane reflections, with k ≥ 2n − 3, and we get a total of
2n − 1 hyperplane reflections. This proves the induction step.
The bound 2n − 1 is not optimal. The strong version of the Cartan–Dieudonn´e theorem
says that at most n reflections are needed, but the proof is harder. Here is a neat proof due
to E. Artin (see [6], Chapter III, Section 4).
Case 1 remains unchanged. Case 2 is slightly different: f(u) − u 6 = 0 is not isotropic.
Since ϕ(f(u) + u, f(u) − u) = 0, as in the first subcase of Case (3), g = τf(u)−u ◦ f is such
that g(u) = u and we are back to Case 1. This only costs one more reflection.
The new (bad) case is:
1040 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
Case 3’. f(u) − u is nonzero and isotropic for all nonisotropic u ∈ E. In this case, what
saves us is that E must be an Artinian space of dimension n = 2m and that f must be a
rotation (f ∈ SO(ϕ)).
If we acccept this fact proved in Proposition 29.43 then pick any hyperplane reflection
τ . Then, since f is a rotation, g = τ ◦ f is not a rotation because det(g) = det(τ ) det(f) =
(−1)(+1) = −1, so g(u) − u is either 0 or not isotropic for some nonisotropic u ∈ E
(otherwise, g would be a rotation), we are back to either Case 1 or Case 2, and using the
induction hypothesis, we get
τ ◦ f = τk ◦ . . . , τ1,
where each τi
is a hyperplane reflection, and k ≤ 2m. Since τ ◦ f is not a rotation, actually
k ≤ 2m − 1, and then f = τ ◦ τk ◦ . . . , τ1, the composition of at most k + 1 ≤ 2m hyperplane
reflections.
Therefore, except for the fact that in Case 3’, E must be an Artinian space of dimension
n = 2m and that f must be a rotation, which has not been proven yet, we proved the
following theorem.
Theorem 29.41. (Cartan–Dieudonn´e, strong form) Let ϕ be a nondegenerate symmetric
bilinear form on a K-vector space E of dimension n (char(K) 6 = 2). Then, every isometry
f ∈ O(ϕ) with f 6 = id is the composition of at most n hyperplane reflections.
To fill in the gap, we need two propositions.
Proposition 29.42. Let (E, ϕ) be an Artinian space of dimension 2m, and let U be a
totally isotropic subspace of dimension m. For any isometry f ∈ O(ϕ), if f(U) = U, then
det(f) = 1 (f is a rotation).
Proof. We know that we can find a basis (u1, . . . , um, v1, . . . , vm) of E such (u1, . . . , um) is a
basis of U and ϕ is represented by the matrix

det(A) = det(B) det(D) = det(B

as claimed
Proposition 29.43. Let ϕ be a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on a space E of
dimension n, and let f be any isometry f ∈ O(ϕ) such that f(u)−u is nonzero and isotropic
for every nonisotropic vector u ∈ E. Then, E is an Artinian space of dimension n = 2m,
and f is a rotation (f ∈ SO(ϕ)).
Proof. We follow E. Artin’s proof (see [6], Chapter III, Section 4). First, consider the case
n = 2. Since we are assuming that E has some nonzero isotropic vector, by Proposition
29.26, E is an Artinian plane and there is a basis in which ϕ is represented by the matrix


but u = (λ, 1) is a nonisotropic vector such that f(u) − u = 0. Therefore, we must be in the
first case, and det(f) = +1.
Let us now assume that n ≥ 3. We are going to prove that f(y) − y is isotropic for
all nonzero isotropic vectors y. Let y be any nonzero isotropic vector. Since n ≥ 3, the
orthogonal space (Ky)
⊥ has dimension at least 2, and we know that rad(Ky) = rad((Ky)
⊥),
a space of dimension at most 1, which implies that (Ky)
⊥ contains some nonisotropic vector,
say x. We have ϕ(x, y) = 0, so ϕ(x + y, x + y) = ϕ(x, x) 6 = 0, for  = ±1. Then,
by hypothesis, the vectors f(x) − x, f(x + y) − (x + y) = f(x) − x + (f(y) − y), and
f(x − y) − (x − y) = f(x) − x − (f(y) − y) are isotropic. The last two vectors can be written
as f(x) − x) +  (f(y) − y) with  = ±1, so we have
0 = ϕ(f(x) − x) +  (f(y) − y), f(x) − x) +  (f(y) − y))
= 2ϕ(f(x) − x, f(y) − y)) +  2ϕ(f(y) − y, f(y) − y).
If we write the two equations corresponding to  = ±1, and then add them up, we get
ϕ(f(y) − y, f(y) − y) = 0.
1042 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
This proves that f(y)−y is isotropic for any nonzero isotropic vector y. Since by hypothesis
f(u) − u is isotropic for every nonisotropic vector u, we proved that f(u) − u is isotropic for
every u ∈ E. If we let W = Im(f − id), then every vector in W is isotropic, and thus W is
totally isotropic (recall that we assumed that char(K) 6 = 2, so ϕ is determined by Φ). For
any u ∈ E and any v ∈ W⊥, since W is totally isotropic, we have
ϕ(f(u) − u, f(v) − v) = 0,
and since f(u) − u ∈ W and v ∈ W⊥, we have ϕ(f(u) − u, v) = 0, and so
0 = ϕ(f(u) − u, f(v) − v)
= ϕ(f(u), f(v)) − ϕ(u, f(v)) − ϕ(f(u) − u, v)
= ϕ(u, v) − ϕ(u, f(v))
= ϕ(u, v − f(v)),
for all u ∈ E. Since ϕ is nonsingular, this means that f(v) = v, for all v ∈ W⊥. However,
by hypothesis, no nonisotropic vector is left fixed, which implies that W⊥ is also totally
isotropic. In summary, we proved that W ⊆ W⊥ and W⊥ ⊆ W⊥⊥ = W, that is,
W = W⊥.
Since, dim(W) + dim(W⊥) = n, we conclude that W is a totally isotropic subspace of E
such that
dim(W) = n/2.
By Proposition 29.29, the space E is an Artinian space of dimension n = 2m. Since W = W⊥
and f(W) = W, by Proposition 29.42, the isometry f is a rotation.
Remarks:
1. Another way to finish the proof of Proposition 29.43 is to prove that if f is an isometry,
then
Ker (f − id) = (Im(f − id))⊥.
After having proved that W = Im(f − id) is totally isotropic, we get
Ker (f − id) = Im(f − id),
which implies that (f − id)2 = 0. From this, we deduce that det(f) = 1. For details,
see Jacobson [98] (Chapter 6, Section 6).
2. If f = τHk
◦ · · · ◦ τH1
, where the Hi are hyperplanes, then it can be shown that
dim(H1 ∩ H2 ∩ · · · ∩ Hs) ≥ n − s.
Now, since each Hi
is left fixed by τHi
, we see that every vector in H1 ∩ · · · ∩ Hs is
left fixed by f. In particular, if s < n, then f has some nonzero fixed point. As a
consequence, an isometry without fixed points requires n hyperplane reflections.
29.10. WITT’S THEOREM 1043
29.10 Witt’s Theorem
Witt’s theorem was referred to as a “scandal” by Emil Artin. What he meant by this is
that one had to wait until 1936 (Witt [190]) to formulate and prove a theorem at once so
simple in its statement and underlying concepts, and so useful in various domains (geometry,
arithmetic of quadratic forms).1
Besides Witt’s original proof (Witt [190]), Chevalley’s proof [37] seems to be the “best”
proof that applies to the symmetric as well as the skew-symmetric case. The proof in
Bourbaki [24] is based on Chevalley’s proof, and so are a number of other proofs. This is
the one we follow (slightly reorganized). In the symmetric case, Serre’s exposition is hard to
beat (see Serre [157], Chapter IV).
The following observation is one of the key ingredients in the proof of Theorem 29.45.
Proposition 29.44. Given a finite-dimensional space E equipped with an  -Hermitan form
ϕ, if U1 and U2 are two subspaces of E such that U1 ∩ U2 = (0) and if we have metric linear
maps f1 : U1 → E and f2 : U2 → E such that
ϕ(f1(u1), f2(u2)) = ϕ(u1, u2) for ui ∈ Ui (i = 1, 2), (∗)
then the linear map f : U1 ⊕ U2 → E given by f(u1 + u2) = f1(u1) + f2(u2) extends f1 and
f2 and is metric. Furthermore, if f1 and f2 are injective, then so if f.
Proof. Indeed, since f1 and f2 are metric and using (∗), we have
ϕ(f1(u1) + f2(u2), f1(v1) + f2(v2)) = ϕ(f1(u1), f1(v1)) + ϕ(f1(u1), f2(v2))
+ ϕ(f2(u2), f1(v1)) + ϕ(f2(u2), f2(v2))
= ϕ(u1, v1) + ϕ(u1, v2) + ϕ(u2, v1) + ϕ(u2, v2)
= ϕ(u1 + u2, v2 + v2).
Thus f is a metric map extending f1 and f2.
Theorem 29.45. (Witt, 1936) Let E and E
0 be two finite-dimensional spaces respectively
equipped with two nondegenerate  -Hermitan forms ϕ and ϕ
0 satisfying condition (T), and
assume that there is an isometry between (E, ϕ) and (E
0 , ϕ0 ). For any subspace U of E,
every injective metric linear map f from U into E
0 extends to an isometry from E to E
0 .
Proof. Since (E, ϕ) and (E
0 , ϕ0 ) are isometric, we may assume that E
0 = E and ϕ
0 = ϕ (if
h: E → E
0 is an isometry, then h
−1 ◦f is an injective metric map from U into E. The details
are left to the reader).
1Curiously, some references to Witt’s paper claim its date of publication to be 1936, but others say 1937.
The answer to this mystery is that Volume 176 of Crelle Journal was published in four issues. The cover
page of volume 176 mentions the year 1937, but Witt’s paper is dated May 1936. This is not the only paper
of Witt appearing in this volume!
1044 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
We proceed by induction on the dimension r of U. Since the proof is quite intricate, we
spell out the general plan of attack. For the induction step, we first show that we can reduce
the situation to what we call Case (H), namely that the subspace of U left fixed by f is a
hyperplane H in U. Then, the set D = {f(u) − u | u ∈ U} is a line in U and it turns out
that D⊥ is a hyperplane in E. We now introduce Hypothesis (V), which says we can find a
nontrivial subspace V of E orthogonal to D and such that V ∩ U = V ∩ f(U) = (0). We
show that if Hypothesis (V) holds, then f can be extended to an isometry of U ⊕ V . It is
then possible to further extend f to an isometry of E.
To prove that Hypothesis (V) holds we consider two cases. In Case (a), we obtain some
V such that E = U ⊕ V and we are done. In Case (b), we obtain some V such that
D⊥ = U ⊕ V . We are then reduced to the situation where U = D⊥ is a hyperplane in E and
f is an isometry of U. To finish the proof we pick any v /∈ U, so that E = U ⊕ Kv, and we
find some v1 ∈ E such that
ϕ(f(u), v1) = ϕ(u, v) for all u ∈ U
ϕ(v1, v1) = ϕ(v, v).
Then, by Proposition 29.44, we can extend f to a metric map g of U + Kv = E such that
g(v) = v1. The argument used to find v1 makes use of (†) (see below) and is bit tricky. We
also makes use of Property (T) in the form of Lemma 29.28.
We now go back to the proof. The case r = 0 is trivial. For the induction step, r ≥ 1
so U 6 = (0), and let H be any hyperplane in U. Let f : U → E be an injective metric linear
map. By the induction hypothesis, the restriction f0 of f to H extends to an isometry g0 of
E. If g0 extends f, we are done. Otherwise, H is the subspace of elements of U left fixed by
g0
−1
◦ f. If the theorem holds in this situation, namely the subspace of U left fixed by g0
−1
◦ f
is a hyperplane H in U, then we have an isometry g1 of E extending g0
−1
◦ f, and g0 ◦ g1 is
an isometry of E extending f. Therefore, we are reduced to the following situation:
Case (H). The subspace of U left fixed by f is a hyperplane H in U.
In this case, the set D = {f(u) − u | u ∈ U} is a line in U (a one-dimensional subspace).
For all u, v ∈ U, we have
ϕ(f(u), f(v) − v) = ϕ(f(u), f(v)) − ϕ(f(u), v) = ϕ(u, v) − ϕ(f(u), v) = ϕ(u − f(u), v),
that is
ϕ(f(u), f(v) − v) = ϕ(u − f(u), v) for all u, v ∈ U, (∗∗)
and if u ∈ H, which means that f(u) = u, we get u ∈ D⊥. Therefore, H ⊆ D⊥. Since ϕ is
nondegenerate, we have dim(D) + dim(D⊥) = dim(E), and since dim(D) = 1, the subspace
D⊥ is a hyperplane in E.
Hypothesis (V). We can find a nontrivial subspace V of E orthogonal to D and such that
V ∩ U = V ∩ f(U) = (0).
Claim. Hypothesis (V) implies that f can be extended to an isometry of U ⊕ V .
29.10. WITT’S THEOREM 1045
Proof of Claim. If Hypothesis (V) holds, then we have
ϕ(f(u), v) = ϕ(u, v) for all u ∈ U and all v ∈ V ,
since ϕ(f(u), v) − ϕ(u, v) = ϕ(f(u) − u, v) = 0, with f(u) − u ∈ D and v ∈ V orthogonal
to D. By Proposition 29.44 with f1 = f and f2 the inclusion of V into E, we can extend
f to an injective metric map on U ⊕ V leaving all vectors in V fixed. In this case, the set
{f(w) − w | w ∈ U ⊕ V } is still the line D.
We show below that the fact that f can be extended to U ⊕ V implies that f can be
extended to the whole of E. There are two cases. In Case (a), E = U ⊕ V and we are done.
In case (b), D⊥ = U ⊕ V where D⊥ is a hyperplane in E and f is an isometry of D⊥. By a
subtle argument, we will show that f can be extended to an isometry of E.
We are reduced to proving that a subspace V as above exists. We distinguish between
two cases.
Case (a). U 6⊆ D⊥.
Proof of Case (a). In this case, formula (∗∗) show that f(U) is not contained in D⊥ (check
this!). Consequently,
U ∩ D
⊥ = f(U) ∩ D
