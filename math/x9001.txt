which shows that ω ∈ E and thus, that E = Eω.
37.6 Second-Countable and Separable Spaces
In studying surfaces and manifolds, an important property is the existence of a countable
basis for the topology. Indeed this property, among other things, guarantees the existence
of triangulations of manifolds, and the fact that a manifold is metrizable.

of the xy-plane. The first type of open set does not include ω, i.e. the north pole, while the
second type of open set contains ω.
Definition 37.33. A topological space E is called second-countable if there is a countable
basis for its topology, i.e., if there is a countable family, (Ui)i≥0, of open sets such that every
open set of E is a union of open sets Ui
.
It is easily seen that R
n
is second-countable and more generally, that every normed vector
space of finite dimension is second-countable. More generally, a metric space is second￾countable if and only if it is separable, a very useful property that holds for all of the spaces
that we will consider in practice.
Definition 37.34. A topological space E is separable if it contains some countable subset
S which is dense in X, that is, S = E.
Observe that by Proposition 37.4, a subset S of E is dense in E if and only if every
nonempty open subset of E contains some element of S.
The (metric) space R is separable because Q is a countable dense subset of R. Similarly,
C is separable. In general, Qn
is dense in R
n
, so R
n
is separable, and similarly, every finite￾dimensional normed vector space over R (or C) is separable. For metric spaces, we have the
following useful result.
Proposition 37.37. If E is a metric space, then E is second-countable iff E is separable.
37.6. SECOND-COUNTABLE AND SEPARABLE SPACES 1365
Proof. If B = (Bn) is a countable basis for the topology of E, then for any set S obtained
by picking some point sn in Bn, since every nonempty open subset U of E is the union of
some of the Bn, the intersection U ∩ S is nonempty, and so S is dense in E.
Conversely, assume that there is a countable subset S = (sn) of E which is dense in E.
We claim that the countable family B of open balls B0(sn, 1/m) (m ∈ N, m > 0) is a basis
for the topology of E. For every x ∈ E and every r > 0, there is some m > 0 such that
1/m < r/2, and some n such that sn ∈ B0(x, 1/m). It follows that x ∈ B0(sn, 1/m). For all
y ∈ B0(sn, 1/m), we have
d(x, y) ≤ d(x, sn) + d(sn, y) ≤ 2/m < r,
thus B0(sn, 1/m) ⊆ B0(x, r), which by Proposition 37.8(a) implies that B is a basis for the
topology of E.
Proposition 37.38. If E is a compact metric space, then E is separable.
Proof. For every n > 0, the family of open balls of radius 1/n forms an open cover of E,
and since E is compact, there is a finite subset An of E such that E =
S ai∈An
B0(ai
, 1/n).
It is easy to see that this is equivalent to the condition d(x, An) < 1/n for all x ∈ E. Let
A =
S n≥1 An. Then A is countable, and for evey x ∈ E, we have
d(x, A) ≤ d(x, An) <
1
n
, for all n ≥ 1,
which implies that d(x, A) = 0; that is, A is dense in E.
The following theorem due to Uryshon gives a very useful sufficient condition for a topo￾logical space to be metrizable.
Theorem 37.39. (Urysohn metrization theorem) If a topological space E is regular and
second-countable, then it is metrizable.
The proof of Theorem 37.39 can be found in Munkres [131] (Chapter 4, Theorem 34.1).
As a corollary of Theorem 37.39, every (second-countable) manifold, and thus every Lie
group, is metrizable.
The following technical result shows that a locally compact metrizable space which is
also separable can be expressed as the union of a countable monotonic sequence of compact
subsets. This gives us a method for generalizing various properties of compact metric spaces
to locally compact metric spaces of the above kind.
Proposition 37.40. Let E be a locally compact metric space. The following properties are
equivalent:
(1) There is a sequence (Un)n≥0 of open subsets such that for all n ∈ N, Un ⊆ Un+1, Un is
compact, Un ⊆ Un+1, and E =
S n≥0 Un =
S n≥0 Un.
1366 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
(2) The space E is the union of a countable family of compact subsets of E.
(3) The space E is separable.
Proof. We show (1) implies (2), (2) implies (3), and (3) implies (1). Obviously, (1) implies
(2) since the Un are compact.
If (2) holds, then E =
S n≥0 Kn, for some compact subsets Kn. By Proposition 37.38,
each compact subset Kn is separable, so let Sn be a countable dense subset of Kn, Then
S =
S n≥0 Sn is a countable dense subset of E, since
E =
[
n≥0
Kn ⊆
[
n≥0
Sn ⊆ S ⊆ E.
Consequently (3) holds.
If (3) holds, let S = {sn} be a countable dense subset of E. By Proposition 37.37, the
space E has a countable basis B of open sets On. Since E is locally compact, for every x ∈ E,
there is some compact neighborhood Wx containing x, and by Proposition 37.8, there some
index n(x) such that x ∈ On(x) ⊆ Wx. Since Wx is a compact neighborhood, we deduce that
On(x)
is compact. Consequently, there is a subfamily of B consisting of open subsets Oi such
that Oi
is compact, which is a countable basis for the topology of E, so we may assume that
we restrict our attention to this basis. We define the sequence (Un)n≥1 of open subsets of E
by induction as follows: Set U1 = O1, and let
Un+1 = On+1 ∪ Vr(Un),
where r > 0 is chosen so that Vr(Un) is compact, which is possible by Proposition 37.35. We
immediately check that the Un satisfy (1) of Proposition 37.40.
It can also be shown that if E is a locally compact space that has a countable basis, then
Eω also has a countable basis (and in fact, is metrizable).
We also have the following property.
Proposition 37.41. Given a second-countable topological space E, every open cover (Ui)i∈I ,
of E contains some countable subcover.
Proof. Let (On)n≥0 be a countable basis for the topology. Then all sets On contained in
some Ui can be arranged into a countable subsequence, (Ωm)m≥0, of (On)n≥0 and for every
Ωm, there is some Uim such that Ωm ⊆ Uim. Furthermore, every Ui
is some union of sets Ωj
,
and thus, every a ∈ E belongs to some Ωj
, which shows that (Ωm)m≥0 is a countable open
subcover of (Ui)i∈I .
As an immediate corollary of Proposition 37.41, a locally connected second-countable
space has countably many connected components.
37.7. SEQUENTIAL COMPACTNESS 1367
37.7 Sequential Compactness
For a general topological Hausdorff space E, the definition of compactness relies on the
existence of finite cover. However, when E has a countable basis or is a metric space, we
may define the notion of compactness in terms of sequences. To understand how this is done,
we need to first define accumulation points.
Definition 37.35. Given a topological Hausdorff space, E, given any sequence, (xn), of
points in E, a point, l ∈ E, is an accumulation point (or cluster point) of the sequence (xn)
if every open set, U, containing l contains xn for infinitely many n. See Figure 37.38.

Figure 37.38: The space E is the closed, bounded pink subset of R
2
. The sequence (xn) has
two accumulation points, one for the subsequence (x2n+1) and one for (x2n).
Clearly, if l is a limit of the sequence, (xn), then it is an accumulation point, since every
open set, U, containing a contains all xn except for finitely many n.
For second-countable spaces we are able to give another characterization of accumulation
points.
Proposition 37.42. Given a second-countable topological Hausdorff space, E, a point, l, is
an accumulation point of the sequence, (xn), iff l is the limit of some subsequence, (xnk
), of
(xn).
Proof. Clearly, if l is the limit of some subsequence (xnk
) of (xn), it is an accumulation point
of (xn).
Conversely, let (Uk)k≥0 be the sequence of open sets containing l, where each Uk belongs
to a countable basis of E, and let Vk = U1 ∩ · · · ∩ Uk. For every k ≥ 1, we can find some
nk > nk−1 such that xnk ∈ Vk, since l is an accumulation point of (xn). Now, since every
open set containing l contains some Uk0 and since xnk ∈ Uk0
for all k ≥ 0, the sequence (xnk
)
has limit l.
1368 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Remark: Proposition 37.42 also holds for metric spaces.
As an illustration of Proposition 37.42 let (xn) be the sequence (1, −1, 1, −1, . . .). This
sequence has two accumulation points, namely 1 and −1 since (x2n+1) = (1) and (x2n) =
(−1).
In second-countable Hausdorff spaces, compactness can be characterized in terms of ac￾cumulation points (this is also true for metric spaces).
Proposition 37.43. A second-countable topological Hausdorff space, E, is compact iff every
sequence, (xn), of E has some accumulation point in E.
Proof. Assume that every sequence, (xn), has some accumulation point. Let (Ui)i∈I be some
open cover of E. By Proposition 37.41, there is a countable open subcover, (On)n≥0, for E.
Now, if E is not covered by any finite subcover of (On)n≥0, we can define a sequence, (xm),
by induction as follows:
Let x0 be arbitrary and for every m ≥ 1, let xm be some point in E not in O1 ∪ · · · ∪ Om,
which exists, since O1 ∪ · · · ∪ Om is not an open cover of E. We claim that the sequence,
(xm), does not have any accumulation point. Indeed, for every l ∈ E, since (On)n≥0 is an
open cover of E, there is some Om such that l ∈ Om, and by construction, every xn with
n ≥ m + 1 does not belong to Om, which means that xn ∈ Om for only finitely many n and
l is not an accumulation point. See Figure 37.39.

Figure 37.39: The space E is the open half plane above the line y = −1. S ince E is not
compact, we inductively build a sequence, (xn) that will have no accumulation point in E.
Note the y coordinate of xn approaches infinity.
Conversely, assume that E is compact, and let (xn) be any sequence . If l ∈ E is not
an accumulation point of the sequence, then there is some open set, Ul
, such that l ∈ Ul
37.7. SEQUENTIAL COMPACTNESS 1369
and xn ∈ Ul
for only finitely many n. Thus, if (xn) does not have any accumulation point,
the family, (Ul)l∈E, is an open cover of E and since E is compact, it has some finite open
subcover, (Ul)l∈J , where J is a finite subset of E. But every Ul with l ∈ J is such that
xn ∈ Ul
for only finitely many n, and since J is finite, xn ∈
S l∈J Ul
for only finitely many n,
which contradicts the fact that (Ul)l∈J is an open cover of E, and thus contains all the xn.
Thus, (xn) has some accumulation point. See Figure 37.40.

Figure 37.40: The space E the closed triangular region of R

. Given a sequence (xn) of red
points in E, if the sequence has no accumulation points, then each li
for 1 ≤ i ≤ 8, is not an
accumulation point. But as implied by the illustration, l8 actually is an accumulation point
of (xn).
Remarks:
1. By combining Propositions 37.42 and 37.43, we have observe that a second-countable
Hausdorff space E is compact iff every sequence (xn) has a convergent subsequence
(xnk
). In other words, we say a second-countable Hausdorff space E is compact iff it
is sequentially compact.
2. It should be noted that the proof showing that if E is compact, then every sequence
has some accumulation point, holds for any arbitrary compact space (the proof does
not use a countable basis for the topology). The converse also holds for metric spaces.
We will prove this converse since it is a major property of metric spaces.
Given a metric space in which every sequence has some accumulation point, we first prove
the existence of a Lebesgue number .
1370 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Lemma 37.44. Given a metric space, E, if every sequence, (xn), has an accumulation point,
for every open cover, (Ui)i∈I , of E, there is some δ > 0 (a Lebesgue number for (Ui)i∈I ) such
that, for every open ball, B0(a, ), of radius  ≤ δ, there is some open subset, Ui, such that
B0(a, ) ⊆ Ui. See Figure 37.41

i=1. The
Lebesque number is the radius of the small orange balls labelled 1 through 14. Each open
ball of this radius entirely contained within at least one Ui
. For example, Ball 2 is contained
in both U1 and U2.
Proof. If there was no δ with the above property, then, for every natural number, n, there
would be some open ball, B0(an, 1/n), which is not contained in any open set, Ui
, of the
open cover, (Ui)i∈I . However, the sequence, (an), has some accumulation point, a, and since
(Ui)i∈I is an open cover of E, there is some Ui such that a ∈ Ui
. Since Ui
is open, there is
some open ball of center a and radius  contained in Ui
. Now, since a is an accumulation
point of the sequence, (an), every open set containing a contains an for infinitely many n
and thus, there is some n large enough so that
1/n ≤ /2 and an ∈ B0(a, /2),
which implies that
B0(an, 1/n) ⊆ B0(a, ) ⊆ Ui
,
a contradiction.
By a previous remark, since the proof of Proposition 37.43 implies that in a compact
topological space, every sequence has some accumulation point, by Lemma 37.44, in a com￾pact metric space, every open cover has a Lebesgue number. This fact can be used to prove
another important property of compact metric spaces, the uniform continuity theorem.
37.7. SEQUENTIAL COMPACTNESS 1371
Definition 37.36. Given two metric spaces, (E, dE) and (F, dF ), a function, f : E → F, is
uniformly continuous if for every  > 0, there is some η > 0, such that, for all a, b ∈ E,
if dE(a, b) ≤ η then dF (f(a), f(b)) ≤ .

x is uniformly continuous over (0,∞). Fix

. If the x values lie within the rose colored η strip, the y values always lie within the peach

strip.
As we saw earlier, the metric on a metric space is uniformly continuous, and the norm
on a normed metric space is uniformly continuous.
The uniform continuity theorem can be stated as follows:
Theorem 37.45. Given two metric spaces, (E, dE) and (F, dF ), if E is compact and if
f : E → F is a continuous function, then f is uniformly continuous.
Proof. Consider any  > 0 and let (B0(y, /2))y∈F be the open cover of F consisting of open
balls of radius /2. Since f is continuous, the family,
(f
−1
(B0(y, /2)))y∈F ,
is an open cover of E. Since, E is compact, by Lemma 37.44, there is a Lebesgue number,
δ, such that for every open ball, B0(a, η), of radius η ≤ δ, then B0(a, η) ⊆ f
−1
(B0(y, /2)),
for some y ∈ F. In particular, for any a, b ∈ E such that dE(a, b) ≤ η = δ/2, we have
a, b ∈ B0(a, δ) and thus, a, b ∈ f
−1
(B0(y, /2)), which implies that f(a), f(b) ∈ B0(y, /2).
But then, dF (f(a), f(b)) ≤  , as desired.
We now prove another lemma needed to obtain the characterization of compactness in
metric spaces in terms of accumulation points.

Fix  . In order for the y values to lie within the peach epsilon strip, the widths of the eta
strips decrease as x → 0.
Lemma 37.46. Given a metric space, E, if every sequence, (xn), has an accumulation point,
then for every  > 0, there is a finite open cover, B0(a0, ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an, ), of E by open
balls of radius  .
Proof. Let a0 be any point in E. If B0(a0, ) = E, then the lemma is proved. Otherwise,
assume that a sequence, (a0, a1, . . . , an), has been defined, such that B0(a0, )∪· · ·∪B0(an, )
does not cover E. Then, there is some an+1 not in B0(a0, ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an, ) and either
B0(a0, ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an+1, ) = E,
in which case the lemma is proved, or we obtain a sequence, (a0, a1, . . . , an+1), such that
B0(a0, ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an+1, ) does not cover E. If this process goes on forever, we obtain an
infinite sequence, (an), such that d(am, an) >  for all m 6 = n. Since every sequence in E
has some accumulation point, the sequence, (an), has some accumulation point, a. Then,
for infinitely many n, we must have d(an, a) ≤ /3 and thus, for at least two distinct natural
numbers, p, q, we must have d(ap, a) ≤ /3 and d(aq, a) ≤ /3, which implies d(ap, aq) ≤
d(ap, a) +d(aq, a) ≤ 2/3, contradicting the fact that d(am, an) >  for all m 6 = n. See Figure
37.44. Thus, there must be some n such that
B0(a0, ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an, ) = E.
Definition 37.37. A metric space E is said to be precompact (or totally bounded) if for
every  > 0, there is a finite open cover, B0(a0, ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an, ), of E by open balls of
radius  .
We now obtain the Weierstrass–Bolzano property.

orange balls with radius  , the points of the sequence (an) are separated by a distance of at
least  . This contradicts the fact that a is the accumulation point of a, as evidenced by the
enlargement of the plum disk in Figure (ii).
Theorem 37.47. A metric space, E, is compact iff every sequence, (xn), has an accumula￾tion point.
Proof. We already observed that the proof of Proposition 37.43 shows that for any compact
space (not necessarily metric), every sequence, (xn), has an accumulation point. Conversely,
let E be a metric space, and assume that every sequence, (xn), has an accumulation point.
Given any open cover, (Ui)i∈I for E, we must find a finite open subcover of E. By Lemma
37.44, there is some δ > 0 (a Lebesgue number for (Ui)i∈I ) such that, for every open ball,
B0(a, ), of radius  ≤ δ, there is some open subset, Uj
, such that B0(a, ) ⊆ Uj
. By Lemma
37.46, for every δ > 0, there is a finite open cover, B0(a0, δ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an, δ), of E by open
balls of radius δ. But from the previous statement, every open ball, B0(ai
, δ), is contained
in some open set, Uji
, and thus, {Uj1
, . . . , Ujn } is an open cover of E.
37.8 Complete Metric Spaces and Compactness

sequences. Such a characterization is quite useful in fractal geometry (and elsewhere). First

1374 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
recall the definition of a Cauchy sequence and of a complete metric space.
Definition 37.38. Given a metric space, (E, d), a sequence, (xn)n∈N, in E is a Cauchy
sequence if the following condition holds: for every  > 0, there is some p ≥ 0, such that, for
all m, n ≥ p, then d(xm, xn) ≤  .
If every Cauchy sequence in (E, d) converges we say that (E, d) is a complete metric
space.
First let us show the following proposition:
Proposition 37.48. Given a metric space, E, if a Cauchy sequence, (xn), has some accu￾mulation point, a, then a is the limit of the sequence, (xn).
Proof. Since (xn) is a Cauchy sequence, for every  > 0, there is some p ≥ 0, such that, for
all m, n ≥ p, then d(xm, xn) ≤ /2. Since a is an accumulation point for (xn), for infinitely
many n, we have d(xn, a) ≤ /2, and thus, for at least some n ≥ p, we have d(xn, a) ≤ /2.
Then, for all m ≥ p,
d(xm, a) ≤ d(xm, xn) + d(xn, a) ≤ ,
which shows that a is the limit of the sequence (xn).
We can now prove the following theorem.
Theorem 37.49. A metric space, E, is compact iff it is precompact and complete.
Proof. Let E be compact. For every  > 0, the family of all open balls of radius  is an open
cover for E and since E is compact, there is a finite subcover, B0(a0, ) ∪ · · · ∪ B0(an, ), of
E by open balls of radius  . Thus E is precompact. Since E is compact, by Theorem 37.47,
every sequence, (xn), has some accumulation point. Thus every Cauchy sequence, (xn), has
some accumulation point, a, and, by Proposition 37.48, a is the limit of (xn). Thus, E is
complete.
Now assume that E is precompact and complete. We prove that every sequence, (xn),
has an accumulation point. By the other direction of Theorem 37.47, this shows that E
is compact. Given any sequence, (xn), we construct a Cauchy subsequence, (yn), of (xn)
as follows: Since E is precompact, letting  = 1, there exists a finite cover, U1, of E by
open balls of radius 1. Thus some open ball, Bo
0
, in the cover, U1, contains infinitely many
elements from the sequence (xn). Let y0 be any element of (xn) in Bo
0
. By induction, assume
that a sequence of open balls, (Bo
i
)1≤i≤m, has been defined, such that every ball, Bo
i
, has
radius 2
1
i
, contains infinitely many elements from the sequence (xn) and contains some yi
from (xn) such that
d(yi
, yi+1) ≤
1
2
i
,
for all i, 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1. See Figure 37.45. Then letting  = 2m
1
+1 , because E is precompact,
there is some finite cover, Um+1, of E by open balls of radius  and thus, of the open ball Bo
m.
37.8. COMPLETE METRIC SPACES AND COMPACTNESS 1375
Thus, some open ball, Bo
m+1, in the cover, Um+1, contains infinitely many elements from the
sequence, (xn), and we let ym+1 be any element of (xn) in Bo
m+1. Thus, we have defined by
induction a sequence, (yn), which is a subsequence of, (xn), and such that
d(yi
, yi+1) ≤
1
2
i
,
for all i. However, for all m, n ≥ 1, we have
d(ym, yn) ≤ d(ym, ym+1) + · · · + d(yn−1, yn) ≤

i=m

i

and thus, (yn) is a Cauchy sequence Since E is complete, the sequence, (yn), has a limit, and
since it is a subsequence of (xn), the sequence, (xn), has some accumulation point.

Another useful property of a complete metric space is that a subset is closed iff it is
complete. This is shown in the following two propositions.
Proposition 37.50. Let (E, d) be a metric space, and let A be a subset of E. If A is complete
(which means that every Cauchy sequence of elements in A converges to some point of A),
then A is closed in E.
1376 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Proof. Assume x ∈ A. By Proposition 37.13, there is some sequence (an) of points an ∈ A
which converges to x. Consequently (an) is a Cauchy sequence in E, and thus a Cauchy
sequence in A (since an ∈ A for all n). Since A is complete, the sequence (an) has a limit
a ∈ A, but since E is a metric space it is Hausdorff, so a = x, which shows that x ∈ A; that
is, A is closed.
Proposition 37.51. Let (E, d) be a metric space, and let A be a subset of E. If E is
complete and if A is closed in E, then A is complete.
Proof. Let (an) be a Cauchy sequence in A. The sequence (an) is also a Cauchy sequence in
E, and since E is complete, it has a limit x ∈ E. But an ∈ A for all n, so by Proposition
37.13 we must have x ∈ A. Since A is closed, actually x ∈ A, which proves that A is
complete.
An arbitrary metric space (E, d) is not necessarily complete, but there is a construction of
a metric space (E, b db) such that Eb is complete, and there is a continuous (injective) distance￾preserving map ϕ: E → b E such that ϕ(E) is dense in b E. This is a generalization of the
construction of the set R of real numbers from the set Q of rational numbers in terms of
Cauchy sequences. This construction can be immediately adapted to a normed vector space
(E, k k ) to embed (E, k k ) into a complete normed vector space ( bE, k k Eb
) (a Banach space).
This construction is used heavily in integration theory, where E is a set of functions.
37.9 Completion of a Metric Space
In order to prove a kind of uniqueness result for the completion (E, b db) of a metric space
(E, d), we need the following result about extending a uniformly continuous function.
Recall that E0 is dense in E iff E0 = E. Since E is a metric space, by Proposition 37.13,
this means that for every x ∈ E, there is some sequence (xn) converging to x, with xn ∈ E0.
Theorem 37.52. Let E and F be two metric spaces, let E0 be a dense subspace of E, and
let f0 : E0 → F be a continuous function. If f0 is uniformly continuous and if F is complete,
then there is a unique uniformly continuous function f : E → F extending f0.
Proof. We follow Schwartz’s proof; see Schwartz [149] (Chapter XI, Section 3, Theorem 1).
Step 1 . We begin by constructing a function f : E → F extending f0. Since E0 is dense
in E, for every x ∈ E, there is some sequence (xn) converging to x, with xn ∈ E0. Then the
sequence (xn) is a Cauchy sequence in E. We claim that (f0(xn)) is a Cauchy sequence in
F.
Proof of the claim. For every  > 0, since f0 is uniformly continuous, there is some η > 0
such that for all (y, z) ∈ E0, if d(y, z) ≤ η, then d(f0(y), f0(z)) ≤  . Since (xn) is a Cauchy
sequence with xn ∈ E0, there is some integer p > 0 such that if m, n ≥ p, then d(xm, xn) ≤ η,
thus d(f0(xm), f0(xn)) ≤  , which proves that (f0(xn)) is a Cauchy sequence in F.
37.9. COMPLETION OF A METRIC SPACE 1377
Since F is complete and (f0(xn)) is a Cauchy sequence in F, the sequence (f0(xn))
converges to some element of F; denote this element by f(x).
Step 2 . Let us now show that f(x) does not depend on the sequence (xn) converging to
x. Suppose that (x
0n
) and (x
00n
) are two sequences of elements in E0 converging to x. Then
the mixed sequence
x
00
, x000
, x01
, x001
, . . . , x0n
, x00n
, . . . ,
also converges to x. It follows that the sequence
f0(x
00
), f0(x
000
), f0(x
01
), f0(x
001
), . . . , f0(x
0n
), f0(x
00n
), . . . ,
is a Cauchy sequence in F, and since F is complete, it converges to some element of F, which
implies that the sequences (f0(x
0n
)) and (f0(x
00n
)) converge to the same limit.
As a summary, we have defined a function f : E → F by
f(x) = limn7→∞
f0(xn).
for any sequence (xn) converging to x, with xn ∈ E0.
Step 3 . The function f extends f0. Since every element x ∈ E0 is the limit of the
constant sequence (xn) with xn = x for all n ≥ 0, by definition f(x) is the limit of the
sequence (f0(xn)), which is the constant sequence with value f0(x), so f(x) = f0(x); that is,
f extends f0.
Step 4 . We now prove that f is uniformly continuous. Since f0 is uniformly contin￾uous, for every  > 0, there is some η > 0 such that if a, b ∈ E0 and d(a, b) ≤ η, then
d(f0(a), f0(b)) ≤  . Consider any two points x, y ∈ E such that d(x, y) ≤ η/2. We claim
that d(f(x), f(y)) ≤  , which shows that f is uniformly continuous.
Let (xn) be a sequence of points in E0 converging to x, and let (yn) be a sequence of
points in E0 converging to y. By the triangle inequality,
d(xn, yn) ≤ d(xn, x) + d(x, y) + d(y, yn) = d(x, y) + d(xn, x) + d(yn, y),
and since (xn) converges to x and (yn) converges to y, there is some integer p > 0 such that
for all n ≥ p, we have d(xn, x) ≤ η/4 and d(yn, y) ≤ η/4, and thus
d(xn, yn) ≤ d(x, y) + η
2
.
Since we assumed that d(x, y) ≤ η/2, we get d(xn, yn) ≤ η for all n ≥ p, and by uniform
continuity of f0, we get
d(f0(xn), f0(yn)) ≤ 
for all n ≥ p. Since the distance function on F is also continuous, and since (f0(xn)) converges
to f(x) and (f0(yn)) converges to f(y), we deduce that the sequence (d(f0(xn), f0(yn)))
converges to d(f(x), f(y)). This implies that d(f(x), f(y)) ≤  , as desired.
1378 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
Step 5 . It remains to prove that f is unique. Since E0 is dense in E, for every x ∈ E,
there is some sequence (xn) converging to x, with xn ∈ E0. Since f extends f0 and since f
is continuous, we get
f(x) = limn7→∞
f0(xn),
which only depends on f0 and x, and shows that f is unique.
Remark: It can be shown that the theorem no longer holds if we either omit the hypothesis
that F is complete or omit that f0 is uniformly continuous.
For example, if E0 6 = E and if we let F = E0 and f0 be the identity function, it is easy to
see that f0 cannot be extended to a continuous function from E to E0 (for any x ∈ E − E0,
any continous extension f of f0 would satisfy f(x) = x, which is absurd since x /∈ E0).
If f0 is continuous but not uniformly continuous, a counter-example can be given by using
E = R = R ∪ {∞} made into a metric space, E0 = R, F = R, and f0 the identity function;
for details, see Schwartz [149] (Chapter XI, Section 3, page 134).
Definition 37.39. If (E, dE) and (F, dF ) are two metric spaces, then a function f : E → F
is distance-preserving, or an isometry, if
dF (f(x), f(y)) = dE(x, y), for all for all x, y ∈ E.
Observe that an isometry must be injective, because if f(x) = f(y), then dF (f(x), f(y)) =
0, and since dF (f(x), f(y)) = dE(x, y), we get dE(x, y) = 0, but dE(x, y) = 0 implies that
x = y. Also, an isometry is uniformly continuous (since we can pick η =  to satisfy the
condition of uniform continuity). However, an isometry is not necessarily surjective.
We now give a construction of the completion of a metric space. This construction is just
a generalization of the classical construction of R from Q using Cauchy sequences.
Theorem 37.53. Let (E, d) be any metric space. There is a complete metric space (E, b db)
called a completion of (E, d), and a distance-preserving (uniformly continuous) map ϕ: E →
Eb such that ϕ(E) is dense in Eb, and the following extension property holds: for every
complete metric space F and for every uniformly continuous function f : E → F, there is a
unique uniformly continuous function b f : b E → F such that
f = fb ◦ ϕ,
as illustrated in the following diagram.

As a consequence, for any two completions (Eb1, db1) and (Eb2, db2) of (E, d), there is a unique
bijective isometry betwen (Eb1, db1) and (Eb2, db2).
37.9. COMPLETION OF A METRIC SPACE 1379
Proof. Consider the set E of all Cauchy sequences (xn) in E, and define the relation ∼ on E
as follows:
(xn) ∼ (yn) iff limn7→∞
d(xn, yn) = 0.
It is easy to check that ∼ is an equivalence relation on E, and let Eb = E/ ∼ be the quotient
set, that is, the set of equivalence classes modulo ∼. Our goal is to show that we can endow
Eb with a distance that makes it into a complete metric space satisfying the conditions of the
theorem. We proceed in several steps.
Step 1 . First, let us construct the function ϕ: E → Eb. For every a ∈ E, we have the
constant sequence (an) such that an = a for all n ≥ 0, which is obviously a Cauchy sequence.
Let ϕ(a) ∈ Eb be the equivalence class [(an)] of the constant sequence (an) with an = a for all
n. By definition of ∼, the equivalence class ϕ(a) is also the equivalence class of all sequences
converging to a. The map a 7→ ϕ(a) is injective because a metric space is Hausdorff, so
if a 6 = b, then a sequence converging to a does not converge to b. After having defined a
distance on Eb, we will check that ϕ is an isometry.
Step 2 . Let us now define a distance on Eb. Let α = [(an)] and β = [(bn)] be two
equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in E. The triangle inequality implies that
d(am, bm) ≤ d(am, an) + d(an, bn) + d(bn, bm) = d(an, bn) + d(am, an) + d(bm, bn)
and
d(an, bn) ≤ d(an, am) + d(am, bm) + d(bm, bn) = d(am, bm) + d(am, an) + d(bm, bn),
which implies that
|d(am, bm) − d(an, bn)| ≤ d(am, an) + d(bm, bn).
Since (an) and (bn) are Cauchy sequences, it follows that (d(an, bn)) is a Cauchy sequence of
nonnegative reals. Since R is complete, the sequence (d(an, bn)) has a limit, which we denote
by db(α, β); that is, we set
db(α, β) = limn7→∞
d(an, bn), α = [(an)], β = [(bn)].
Step 3 . Let us check that db(α, β) does not depend on the Cauchy sequences (an) and
(bn) chosen in the equivalence classes α and β.
If (an) ∼ (a
0n
) and (bn) ∼ (b
0n
), then limn7→∞ d(an, a0n
) = 0 and limn7→∞ d(bn, b0n
) = 0, and
since
d(a
0n
, b0n
) ≤ d(a
0n
, an) + d(an, bn) + d(bn, b0n
) = d(an, bn) + d(an, a0n
) + d(bn, b0n
)
and
d(an, bn) ≤ d(an, a0n
) + d(a
0n
, b0n
) + d(b
0n
, bn) = d(a
0n
, b0n
) + d(an, a0n
) + d(bn, b0n
)
1380 CHAPTER 37. TOPOLOGY
we have
|d(an, bn) − d(a
0n
, b0n
)| ≤ d(an, a0n
) + d(bn, b0n
),
so we have limn7→∞ d(a
0n
, b0n
) = limn7→∞ d(an, bn) = db(α, β). Therefore, db(α, β) is indeed well
defined.
Step 4 . Let us check that ϕ is indeed an isometry.
Given any two elements ϕ(a) and ϕ(b) in Eb, since they are the equivalence classes of
the constant sequences (an) and (bn) such that an = a and bn = b for all n, the constant
sequence (d(an, bn)) with d(an, bn) = d(a, b) for all n converges to d(a, b), so by definition
db(ϕ(a), ϕ(b)) = limn7→∞ d(an, bn) = d(a, b), which shows that ϕ is an isometry.
Step 5 . Let us verify that db is a metric on Eb. By definition it is obvious that db(α, β) =
db(β, α). If α and β are two distinct equivalence classes, then for any Cauchy sequence (an)
in the equivalence class α and for any Cauchy sequence (bn) in the equivalence class β, the
sequences (an) and (bn) are inequivalent, which means that limn7→∞ d(an, bn) 6 = 0, that is,
db(α, β) 6 = 0. Obviously, db(α, α) = 0.
For any equivalence classes α = [(an)], β = [(bn)], and γ = [(cn)], we have the triangle
inequality
d(an, cn) ≤ d(an, bn) + d(bn, cn),
so by continuity of the distance function, by passing to the limit, we obtain
db(α, γ) ≤ db(α, β) + db(β, γ),
which is the triangle inequality for db. Therefore, db is a distance on Eb.
Step 6 . Let us prove that ϕ(E) is dense in Eb. For any α = [(an)], let (xn) be the constant
sequence such that xk = an for all k ≥ 0, so that ϕ(an) = [(xn)]. Then we have
db(α, ϕ(an)) = limm7→∞
d(am, an) ≤ sup
p,q≥n
d(ap, aq).
Since (an) is a Cauchy sequence, supp,q≥n d(ap, aq) tends to 0 as n goes to infinity, so
limn7→∞
d(α, ϕ(an)) = 0,
which means that the sequence (ϕ(an)) converge to α, and ϕ(E) is indeed dense in Eb.
Step 7 . Finally, let us prove that the metric space Eb is complete.
Let (αn) be a Cauchy sequence in Eb. Since ϕ(E) is dense in Eb, for every n > 0, there
some an ∈ E such that
db(αn, ϕ(an)) ≤
1
n
.
Since
db(ϕ(am), ϕ(an)) ≤ db(ϕ(am), αm) + db(αm, αn) + db(αn, ϕ(an)) ≤ db(αm, αn) + 1
m

37.9. COMPLETION OF A METRIC SPACE 1381
and since (αm) is a Cauchy sequence, so is (ϕ(an)), and as ϕ is an isometry, the sequence
(an) is a Cauchy sequence in E. Let α ∈ Eb be the equivalence class of (an). Since
db(α, ϕ(an)) = limm7→∞
d(am, an)
and (an) is a Cauchy sequence, we deduce that the sequence (ϕ(an)) converges to α, and
since d(αn, ϕ(an)) ≤ 1/n for all n > 0, the sequence (αn) also converges to α.
Step 8 . Let us prove the extension property. Let F be any complete metric space and
let f : E → F be any uniformly continuous function. The function ϕ: E → Eb is an isometry
and a bijection between E and its image ϕ(E), so its inverse ϕ
−1
: ϕ(E) → E is also an
isometry, and thus is uniformly continuous. If we let g = f ◦ ϕ
−1
, then g : ϕ(E) → F is
a uniformly continuous function, and ϕ(E) is dense in Eb, so by Theorem 37.52 there is a
unique uniformly continuous function fb : Eb → F extending g = f ◦ ϕ
−1
; see the diagram

This means that

which implies that

that is, f = fb ◦ ϕ, as illustrated in the diagram below:

If h: Eb → F is any other uniformly continuous function such that f = h ◦ ϕ, then
g = f ◦ϕ
−1 = h|ϕ(E), so h is a uniformly continuous function extending g, and by Theorem
37.52, we have have h = fb, so fb is indeed unique.
Step 9 . Uniqueness of the completion (E, b db) up to a bijective isometry.
Let (Eb1, db1) and (Eb2, db2) be any two completions of (E, d). Then we have two uniformly
continuous isometries ϕ1 : E → Eb1 and ϕ2 : E → Eb2 , so by the unique extension property,
there exist unique uniformly continuous maps ϕc2 : b E1 → b E2 and ϕc1 : b E2 → b E1 such that the
