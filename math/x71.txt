⊥ = H.
We can pick V to be any supplement of H in D⊥, and the above formula shows that V ∩U =
V ∩ f(U) = (0). Since U ⊕ V contains the hyperplane D⊥ (since D⊥ = H ⊕ V and H ⊆ U),
and U ⊕ V 6 = D⊥ (since U is not contained in D⊥ and V ⊆ D⊥), we must have E = U ⊕ V ,
and as we showed as a consequence of hypothesis (V), f can be extended to an isometry of
U ⊕ V = E.
Case (b). U ⊆ D⊥.
Proof of Case (b). In this case, formula (∗∗) shows that f(U) ⊆ D⊥ so U +f(U) ⊆ D⊥, and
since D = {f(u) − u | u ∈ U}, we have D ⊆ D⊥; that is, the line D is isotropic.
We show that there exists a subspace V of D⊥, such that
D
⊥ = U ⊕ V = f(U) ⊕ V.
Thus, case (b) shows that we are reduced to the situation where U = D⊥ and f is an isometry
of U.
If U = f(U) we pick V to be a supplement of U in D⊥. Otherwise, let x ∈ U with
x /∈ H, and let y ∈ f(U) with y /∈ H. Since f(H) = H (pointwise), f is injective, and H is
a hyperplane in U, we have
U = H ⊕ Kx, f(U) = H ⊕ Ky.
1046 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
We claim that x + y /∈ U. Otherwise, since y = x + y − x, with x + y, x ∈ U and since
y ∈ f(U), we would have y ∈ U ∩ f(U) = H, a contradiction. Similarly, x + y /∈ f(U). It
follows that
U + f(U) = U ⊕ K(x + y) = f(U) ⊕ K(x + y).
Now, pick W to be any supplement of U + f(U) in D⊥ so that D⊥ = (U + f(U)) ⊕ W, and
let
V = K(x + y) + W.
Then, since x ∈ U, y ∈ f(U), W ⊆ D⊥, and U + f(U) ⊆ D⊥, we have V ⊆ D⊥. We also
have
U ⊕ V = U ⊕ K(x + y) ⊕ W = (U + f(U)) ⊕ W = D
⊥
and
f(U) ⊕ V = f(U) ⊕ K(x + y) ⊕ W = (U + f(U)) ⊕ W = D
⊥,
so as we showed as a consequence of hypothesis (V), f can be extended to an isometry of
the hyperplane D⊥ = U ⊕ V , and D is still the line {f(w) − w | w ∈ U ⊕ V }.
The argument in the proof of Case (b) shows that we are reduced to the situation where
U = D⊥ is a hyperplane in E and f is an isometry of U. If we pick any v /∈ U, then
E = U ⊕ Kv, so suppose we can find some v1 ∈ E such that
ϕ(f(u), v1) = ϕ(u, v) for all u ∈ U
ϕ(v1, v1) = ϕ(v, v).
The first condition is condition (∗) of Proposition 29.44, and the second condition asserts
that the map λv 7→ λv2 from the line Kv to the line Kv1 is a metric map. Then, by
Proposition 29.44, we can extend f to a metric map g of U + Kv = E such that g(v) = v1.
To find v1, let us prove that for every v ∈ E, there is some v
0 ∈ E such that
ϕ(f(u), v0 ) = ϕ(u, v) for all u ∈ U. (†)
This is because the linear form u 7→ ϕ(f
−1
(u), v) (u ∈ U) is the restriction of a linear form
ψ ∈ E
∗
, and since ϕ is nondegenerate, there is some (unique) v
0 ∈ E, such that
ψ(x) = ϕ(x, v0 ) for all x ∈ E,
which implies that
ϕ(u, v0 ) = ϕ(f
−1
(u), v) for all u ∈ U,
and since f is an automorphism of U, that (†) holds. Furthermore, observe that formula
(†) still holds if we add to v
0 any vector y in D, since f(U) = U = D⊥. Therefore, for any
v1 = v
0 + y with y ∈ D, if we extend f to a linear map of E by setting g(v) = v1, then by
(†) we have
ϕ(g(u), g(v)) = ϕ(u, v) for all u ∈ U.
29.10. WITT’S THEOREM 1047
We still need to pick y ∈ D so that v1 = v
0 + y satisfies ϕ(v1, v1) = ϕ(v, v). However, since
v /∈ U = D⊥, the vector v is not orthogonal D, and by Lemma 29.28, there is some y0 ∈ D
such that
ϕ(v
0 + y0, v0 + y0) = ϕ(v, v).
Then, if we let v1 = v
0 + y0, by Proposition 29.44, we can extend f to a metric map g of
U + Kv = E by setting g(v) = v1. Since ϕ is nondegenerate, g is an isometry.
The first corollary of Witt’s theorem is sometimes called the Witt’s cancellation theorem.
Theorem 29.46. (Witt Cancellation Theorem) Let (E1, ϕ1) and (E2, ϕ2) be two pairs of
finite-dimensional spaces and nondegenerate  -Hermitian forms satisfying condition (T), and
assume that (E1, ϕ1) and (E2, ϕ2) are isometric. For any subspace U of E1 and any subspace
V of E2, if there is an isometry f : U → V , then there is an isometry g : U
⊥ → V
⊥.
Proof. If f : U → V is an isometry between U and V , by Witt’s theorem (Theorem 29.46),
the linear map f extends to an isometry g between E1 and E2. We claim that g maps U
⊥
into V
⊥. This is because if v ∈ U
⊥, we have ϕ1(u, v) = 0 for all u ∈ U, so
ϕ2(g(u), g(v)) = ϕ1(u, v) = 0 for all u ∈ U,
and since g is a bijection between U and V , we have g(U) = V , so we see that g(v) is
orthogonal to V for every v ∈ U
⊥; that is, g(U
⊥) ⊆ V
⊥. Since g is a metric map and since
ϕ1 is nondegenerate, the restriction of g to U
⊥ is an isometry from U
⊥ to V
⊥.
A pair (E, ϕ) where E is finite-dimensional and ϕ is a nondegenerate  -Hermitian form
is often called an  -Hermitian space. When  = 1 and ϕ is symmetric, we use the term
Euclidean space or quadratic space. When  = −1 and ϕ is alternating, we use the term
symplectic space. When  = 1 and the automorphism λ 7→ λ is not the identity we use the
term Hermitian space, and when  = −1, we use the term skew-Hermitian space.
We also have the following result showing that the group of isometries of an  -Hermitian
space is transitive on totally isotropic subspaces of the same dimension.
Theorem 29.47. Let E be a finite-dimensional vector space and let ϕ be a nondegenerate

-Hermitian form on E satisfying condition (T). Then for any two totally isotropic subspaces
U and V of the same dimension, there is an isometry f ∈ Isom(ϕ) such that f(U) = V .
Furthermore, every linear automorphism of U is induced by an isometry of E.
Remark: Witt’s cancelation theorem can be used to define an equivalence relation on  -
Hermitian spaces and to define a group structure on these equivalence classes. This way, we
obtain the Witt group, but we will not discuss it here.
Witt’s Theorem can be sharpened to isometries in SO(ϕ), but some condition on U is
needed.
1048 CHAPTER 29. THE GEOMETRY OF BILINEAR FORMS; WITT’S THEOREM
Theorem 29.48. (Witt–Sharpened Version) Let E be a finite-dimensional space equipped
with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear forms ϕ. For any subspace U of E, every linear
injective metric map f from U into E extends to an isometry g of E with a prescribed value
±1 of det(g) iff
dim(U) + dim(rad(U)) < dim(E) = n.
If
dim(U) + dim(rad(U)) = dim(E) = n,
and det(f) = −1, then there is no g ∈ SO(ϕ) extending f.
Proof. If g1 and g2 are two extensions of f such that det(g1) det(g2) = −1, then h = g1
−1
◦ g2
is an isometry such that det(h) = −1, and h leaves every vector of U fixed. Conversely, if h
is an isometry such that det(h) = −1, and h(u) = u for all u ∈ U, then for any extesnion g1
of f, the map g2 = h ◦ g1 is another extension of f such that det(g2) = − det(g1). Therefore,
we need to show that a map h as above exists.
If dim(U)+ dim(rad(U)) < dim(E), consider the nondegenerate completion U of U given
by Proposition 29.32. We know that dim(U) = dim(U) + dim(rad(U)) < n, and since U is
nondegenerate, we have
E = U
⊥
⊕ U
⊥
,
with U
⊥
6
= (0). Pick any isometry τ of U
⊥
such that det(τ ) = −1, and extend it to an
isometry h of E whose restriction to U is the identity.
If dim(U) + dim(rad(U)) = dim(E) = n, then U = V
⊥
⊕ W with V = rad(U) and since
dim(U) = dim(U) + dim(rad(U)) = n, we have
E = U = (V ⊕ V
0 )
⊥
⊕ W,
where V ⊕ V
0 = Ar2r = W⊥ is an Artinian space. Any isometry h of E which is the identity
on U and with det(h) = −1 is the identity on W, and thus it must map W⊥ = Ar2r = V ⊕V
0
into itself, and the restriction h
0 of h to Ar2r has det(h
0 ) = −1. However, h
0 is the identity on
V = rad(U), a totally isotropic subspace of Ar2r of dimension r, and by Proposition 29.42,
we have det(h
0 ) = +1, a contradiction.
It can be shown that the center of O(ϕ) is {id, −id}. For further properties of orthogonal
groups, see Grove [83], Jacobson [98], Taylor [174], and Artin [6].

Polynomials, Ideals and PID’s
30.1 Multisets
This chapter contains a review of polynomials and their basic properties. First, multisets
are defined. Polynomials in one variable are defined next. The notion of a polynomial
function in one argument is defined. Polynomials in several variable are defined, and so is
the notion of a polynomial function in several arguments. The Euclidean division algorithm is
presented, and the main consequences of its existence are derived. Ideals are defined, and the
characterization of greatest common divisors of polynomials in one variables (gcd’s) in terms
of ideals is shown. We also prove the Bezout identity. Next, we consider the factorization of
polynomials in one variables into irreducible factors. The unique factorization of polynomials
in one variable into irreducible factors is shown. Roots of polynomials and their multiplicity
are defined. It is shown that a nonnull polynomial in one variable and of degree m over an
integral domain has at most m roots. The chapter ends with a brief treatment of polynomial
interpolation: Lagrange, Newton, and Hermite interpolants are introduced.
In this chapter, it is assumed that all rings considered are commutative. Recall that a
(commutative) ring A is an integral domain (or an entire ring) if 1 6 = 0, and if ab = 0, then
either a = 0 or b = 0, for all a, b ∈ A. This second condition is equivalent to saying that if
a 6 = 0 and b 6 = 0, then ab 6 = 0. Also, recall that a 6 = 0 is not a zero divisor if ab 6 = 0 whenever
b 6 = 0. Observe that a field is an integral domain.
Our goal is to define polynomials in one or more indeterminates (or variables) X1, . . . , Xn,
with coefficients in a ring A. This can be done in several ways, and we choose a definition
that has the advantage of extending immediately from one to several variables. First, we
need to review the notion of a (finite) multiset.
Definition 30.1. Given a set I, a (finite) multiset over I is any function M : I → N such
that M(i) 6 = 0 for finitely many i ∈ I. The multiset M such that M(i) = 0 for all i ∈ I is
the empty multiset, and it is denoted by 0. If M(i) = k 6 = 0, we say that i is a member of
M of multiplicity k. The union M1 + M2 of two multisets M1 and M2 is defined such that
(M1 + M2)(i) = M1(i) + M2(i), for every i ∈ I. If I is finite, say I = {1, . . . , n}, the multiset
1051
1052 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
M such that M(i) = ki
for every i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is denoted by k1 · 1 + · · · + kn · n, or more
simply, by (k1, . . . , kn), and deg(k1 · 1 + · · · + kn · n) = k1 + · · · + kn is the size or degree of
M. The set of all multisets over I is denoted by N
(I)
, and when I = {1, . . . , n}, by N
(n)
.
Intuitively, the order of the elements of a multiset is irrelevant, but the multiplicity of
each element is relevant, contrary to sets. Every i ∈ I is identified with the multiset Mi such
that Mi(i) = 1 and Mi(j) = 0 for j 6 = i. When I = {1}, the set N
(1) of multisets k · 1 can be
identified with N and {1}
∗
. We will denote k · 1 simply by k.

However, beware that when n ≥ 2, the set N
(n) of multisets cannot be identified with the
set of strings in {1, . . . , n}
∗
, because multiset union is commutative, but concatenation
of strings in {1, . . . , n}
∗
is not commutative when n ≥ 2. This is because in a multiset
k1 · 1 + · · · + kn · n, the order is irrelevant, whereas in a string, the order is relevant. For
example, 2 · 1 + 3 · 2 = 3 · 2 + 2 · 1, but 11222 6 = 22211, as strings over {1, 2}.
Nevertherless, N
(n) and the set N
n of ordered n-tuples under component-wise addition
are isomorphic under the map
k1 · 1 + · · · + kn · n 7→ (k1, . . . , kn).
Thus, since the notation (k1, . . . , kn) is less cumbersome that k1 · 1 + · · · + kn · n, it will be
preferred. We just have to remember that the order of the ki
is really irrelevant.

But when I is infinite, beware that N
(I) and the set N
I of ordered I-tuples are not
isomorphic.
We are now ready to define polynomials.
30.2 Polynomials
We begin with polynomials in one variable.
Definition 30.2. Given a ring A, we define the set PA(1) of polynomials over A in one
variable as the set of functions P : N → A such that P(k) 6 = 0 for finitely many k ∈ N. The
polynomial such that P(k) = 0 for all k ∈ N is the null (or zero) polynomial and it is denoted
by 0. We define addition of polynomials, multiplication by a scalar, and multiplication of
polynomials, as follows: Given any three polynomials P, Q, R ∈ PA(1), letting ak = P(k),
bk = Q(k), and ck = R(k), for every k ∈ N, we define R = P + Q such that
ck = ak + bk,
R = λP such that
ck = λak,
where λ ∈ A,
30.2. POLYNOMIALS 1053
and R = P Q such that
ck =
X
i+j=k
aibj
.
We define the polynomial ek such that ek(k) = 1 and ek(i) = 0 for i 6 = k. We also denote
e0 by 1 when k = 0. Given a polynomial P, the ak = P(k) ∈ A are called the coefficients
of P. If P is not the null polynomial, there is a greatest n ≥ 0 such that an 6 = 0 (and thus,
ak = 0 for all k > n) called the degree of P and denoted by deg(P). Then, P is written
uniquely as
P = a0e0 + a1e1 + · · · + anen.
When P is the null polynomial, we let deg(P) = −∞.
There is an injection of A into PA(1) given by the map a 7→ a1 (recall that 1 denotes e0).
There is also an injection of N into PA(1) given by the map k 7→ ek. Observe that ek = e
k
1
(with e
0
1 = e0 = 1). In order to alleviate the notation, we often denote e1 by X, and we call
X a variable (or indeterminate). Then, ek = e
k
1
is denoted by Xk
. Adopting this notation,
given a nonnull polynomial P of degree n, if P(k) = ak, P is denoted by
P = a0 + a1X + · · · + anX
n
,
or by
P = anX
n + an−1X
n−1 + · · · + a0,
if this is more convenient (the order of the terms does not matter anyway). Sometimes, it
will also be convenient to write a polynomial as
P = a0X
n + a1X
n−1 + · · · + an.
The set PA(1) is also denoted by A[X] and a polynomial P may be denoted by P(X).
In denoting polynomials, we will use both upper-case and lower-case letters, usually, P, Q,
R, S, p, q, r, s, but also f, g, h, etc., if needed (as long as no ambiguities arise).
Given a nonnull polynomial P of degree n, the nonnull coefficient an is called the leading
coefficient of P. The coefficient a0 is called the constant term of P. A polynomial of the
form akXk
is called a monomial. We say that akXk occurs in P if ak 6 = 0. A nonzero
polynomial P of degree n is called a monic polynomial (or unitary polynomial, or monic) if
an = 1, where an is its leading coefficient, and such a polynomial can be written as
P = X
n + an−1X
n−1 + · · · + a0 or P = X
n + a1X
n−1 + · · · + an.

The choice of the variable X to denote e1 is standard practice, but there is nothing special
about X. We could have chosen Y , Z, or any other symbol, as long as no ambiguities
arise.
1054 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
Formally, the definition of PA(1) has nothing to do with X. The reason for using X is
simply convenience. Indeed, it is more convenient to write a polynomial as P = a0 + a1X +
· · · + anXn
rather than as P = a0e0 + a1e1 + · · · + anen.
We have the following simple but crucial proposition.
Proposition 30.1. Given two nonnull polynomials P(X) = a0+a1X +· · ·+amXm of degree
m and Q(X) = b0 + b1X + · · · + bnXn of degree n, if either am or bn is not a zero divisor,
then ambn 6 = 0, and thus, P Q 6 = 0 and
deg(P Q) = deg(P) + deg(Q).
In particular, if A is an integral domain, then A[X] is an integral domain.
Proof. Since the coefficient of Xm+n
in P Q is ambn, and since we assumed that either am or
an is not a zero divisor, we have ambn 6 = 0, and thus, P Q 6 = 0 and
deg(P Q) = deg(P) + deg(Q).
Then, it is obvious that A[X] is an integral domain.
It is easily verified that A[X] is a commutative ring, with multiplicative identity 1X0 = 1.
It is also easily verified that A[X] satisfies all the conditions of Definition 3.1, but A[X] is
not a vector space, since A is not necessarily a field.
A structure satisfying the axioms of Definition 3.1 when K is a ring (and not necessarily
a field) is called a module. Modules fail to have some of the nice properties that vector
spaces have, and thus, they are harder to study. For example, there are modules that do not
have a basis. We postpone the study of modules until Chapter 35.
However, when the ring A is a field, A[X] is a vector space. But even when A is just a
ring, the family of polynomials (Xk
)k∈N is a basis of A[X], since every polynomial P(X) can
be written in a unique way as P(X) = a0 + a1X + · · · + anXn
(with P(X) = 0 when P(X)
is the null polynomial). Thus, A[X] is a free module.
Next, we want to define the notion of evaluating a polynomial P(X) at some α ∈ A. For
this, we need a proposition.
Proposition 30.2. Let A, B be two rings and let h: A → B be a ring homomorphism.
For any β ∈ B, there is a unique ring homomorphism ϕ: A[X] → B extending h such that
ϕ(X) = β, as in the following diagram (where we denote by h+β the map h+β : A∪{X} → B
such that (h + β)(a) = h(a) for all a ∈ A and (h + β)(X) = β):

30.2. POLYNOMIALS 1055
Proof. Let ϕ(0) = 0, and for every nonull polynomial P(X) = a0 + a1X + · · · + anXn
, let
ϕ(P(X)) = h(a0) + h(a1)β + · · · + h(an)β
n
.
It is easily verified that ϕ is the unique homomorphism ϕ: A[X] → B extending h such that
ϕ(X) = β.
Taking A = B in Proposition 30.2 and h: A → A the identity, for every β ∈ A, there
is a unique homomorphism ϕβ : A[X] → A such that ϕβ(X) = β, and for every polynomial
P(X), we write ϕβ(P(X)) as P(β) and we call P(β) the value of P(X) at X = β. Thus, we
can define a function PA : A → A such that PA(β) = P(β), for all β ∈ A. This function is
called the polynomial function induced by P.
More generally, PB can be defined for any (commutative) ring B such that A ⊆ B. In
general, it is possible that PA = QA for distinct polynomials P, Q. We will see shortly
conditions for which the map P 7→ PA is injective. In particular, this is true for A = R (in
general, any infinite integral domain). We now define polynomials in n variables.
Definition 30.3. Given n ≥ 1 and a ring A, the set PA(n) of polynomials over A in n
variables is the set of functions P : N
(n) → A such that P(k1, . . . , kn) 6 = 0 for finitely many
(k1, . . . , kn) ∈ N
(n)
. The polynomial such that P(k1, . . . , kn) = 0 for all (k1, . . . , kn) is
the null (or zero) polynomial and it is denoted by 0. We define addition of polynomials,
multiplication by a scalar, and multiplication of polynomials, as follows: Given any three
polynomials P, Q, R ∈ PA(n), letting a(k1,...,kn) = P(k1, . . . , kn), b(k1,...,kn) = Q(k1, . . . , kn),
c(k1,...,kn) = R(k1, . . . , kn), for every (k1, . . . , kn) ∈ N
(n)
, we define R = P + Q such that
c(k1,...,kn) = a(k1,...,kn) + b(k1,...,kn)
,
R = λP, where λ ∈ A, such that
c(k1,...,kn) = λa(k1,...,kn)
,
and R = P Q, such that
c(k1,...,kn) =
X
(i1,...,in)+(j1,...,jn)=(k1,...,kn)
a(i1,...,in)b(j1,...,jn)
.
For every (k1, . . . , kn) ∈ N
(n)
, we let e(k1,...,kn) be the polynomial such that
e(k1,...,kn)(k1, . . . , kn) = 1 and e(k1,...,kn)(h1, . . . , hn) = 0,
for (h1, . . . , hn) 6 = (k1, . . . , kn). We also denote e(0,...,0) by 1. Given a polynomial P, the
a(k1,...,kn) = P(k1, . . . , kn) ∈ A, are called the coefficients of P. If P is not the null polynomial,
there is a greatest d ≥ 0 such that a(k1,...,kn) 6 = 0 for some (k1, . . . , kn) ∈ N
(n)
, with d =
k1 + · · · + kn, called the total degree of P and denoted by deg(P). Then, P is written
uniquely as
P =
X
(k1,...,kn)∈N(n)
a(k1,...,kn)e(k1,...,kn)
.
When P is the null polynomial, we let deg(P) = −∞.
1056 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
There is an injection of A into PA(n) given by the map a 7→ a1 (where 1 denotes e(0,...,0)).
There is also an injection of N
(n)
into PA(n) given by the map (h1, . . . , hn) 7→ e(h1,...,hn)
. Note
that e(h1,...,hn)e(k1,...,kn) = e(h1+k1,...,hn+kn)
. In order to alleviate the notation, let X1, . . . , Xn
be n distinct variables and denote e(0,...,0,1,0...,0), where 1 occurs in the position i, by Xi
(where 1 ≤ i ≤ n). With this convention, in view of e(h1,...,hn)e(k1,...,kn) = e(h1+k1,...,hn+kn)
, the
polynomial e(k1,...,kn)
is denoted by X1
k1
· · · Xn
kn (with e(0,...,0) = X1
0
· · · Xn
0 = 1) and it is called
a primitive monomial. Then, P is also written as
P =
X
(k1,...,kn)∈N(n)
a(k1,...,kn)X1
k1
· · · Xn
kn
.
We also denote PA(n) by A[X1, . . . , Xn]. A polynomial P ∈ A[X1, . . . , Xn] is also denoted
by P(X1, . . . , Xn).
As in the case n = 1, there is nothing special about the choice of X1, . . . , Xn as variables
(or indeterminates). It is just a convenience. After all, the construction of PA(n) has nothing
to do with X1, . . . , Xn.
Given a nonnull polynomial P of degree d, the nonnull coefficients a(k1,...,kn) 6 = 0 such
that d = k1 + · · · + kn are called the leading coefficients of P. A polynomial of the form
a(k1,...,kn)X1

Taking A = B in Proposition 30.3 and h: A → A the identity, for every β1, . . . , βn ∈ A,
there is a unique homomorphism ϕ: A[X1, . . . , Xn] → A such that ϕ(Xi) = βi
, and for
every polynomial P(X1, . . . , Xn), we write ϕ(P(X1, . . . , Xn)) as P(β1, . . . , βn) and we call
P(β1, . . . , βn) the value of P(X1, . . . , Xn) at X1 = β1, . . . , Xn = βn. Thus, we can define a
function PA : An → A such that PA(β1, . . . , βn) = P(β1, . . . , βn), for all β1, . . . , βn ∈ A. This
function is called the polynomial function induced by P.
More generally, PB can be defined for any (commutative) ring B such that A ⊆ B. As
in the case of a single variable, it is possible that PA = QA for distinct polynomials P, Q.
We will see shortly that the map P 7→ PA is injective when A = R (in general, any infinite
integral domain).

where each polynomial Qkn
(X1, . . . , Xn−1) is in A[X1, . . . , Xn−1]. Even if A is a field,
A[X1, . . . , Xn−1] is not a field, which confirms that it is useful (and necessary!) to consider
polynomials over rings that are not necessarily fields.
It is not difficult to show that A[X1, . . . , Xn] and A[X1, . . . , Xn−1][Xn] are isomorphic
rings. This way, it is often possible to prove properties of polynomials in several variables
X1, . . . , Xn, by induction on the number n of variables. For example, given two nonnull
polynomials P(X1, . . . , Xn) of total degree p and Q(X1, . . . , Xn) of total degree q, since we
assumed that A is an integral domain, we can prove that
deg(P Q) = deg(P) + deg(Q),
and that A[X1, . . . , Xn] is an integral domain.
Next, we will consider the division of polynomials (in one variable).
30.3 Euclidean Division of Polynomials
We know that every natural number n ≥ 2 can be written uniquely as a product of powers of
prime numbers and that prime numbers play a very important role in arithmetic. It would be
nice if every polynomial could be expressed (uniquely) as a product of “irreducible” factors.
This is indeed the case for polynomials over a field. The fact that there is a division algorithm
for the natural numbers is essential for obtaining many of the arithmetical properties of the
natural numbers. As we shall see next, there is also a division algorithm for polynomials in
A[X], when A is a field.
Proposition 30.4. Let A be a ring, let f(X), g(X) ∈ A[X] be two polynomials of degree
m = deg(f) and n = deg(g) with f(X) 6 = 0, and assume that the leading coefficient am of
f(X) is invertible. Then, there exist unique polynomials q(X) and r(X) in A[X] such that
g = fq + r and deg(r) < deg(f) = m.
Proof. We first prove the existence of q and r. Let
f = amX
m + am−1X
m−1 + · · · + a0,
and
g = bnX
n + bn−1X
n−1 + · · · + b0.
If n < m, then let q = 0 and r = g. Since deg(g) < deg(f) and r = g, we have deg(r) <
deg(f).
30.3. EUCLIDEAN DIVISION OF POLYNOMIALS 1059
If n ≥ m, we proceed by induction on n. If n = 0, then g = b0, m = 0, f = a0 6 = 0, and
we let q = a
−
0

b0 and r = 0. Since deg(r) = deg(0) = −∞ and deg(f) = deg(a0) = 0 because
a0 6 = 0, we have deg(r) < deg(f).
If n ≥ 1, since n ≥ m, note that
g1(X) = g(X) − bna

m−1 + · · · + a0)
is a polynomial of degree deg(g1) < n, since the terms bnXn and bna
−

n cancel out. Now, since deg(g1) < n, by the induction hypothesis, we can find q1 and r
such that
g1 = fq1 + r and deg(r) < deg(f) = m,
and thus,
g1(X) = g(X) − bna
−
m
1X
n−mf(X) = f(X)q1(X) + r(X),
from which, letting q(X) = bna
−
m
1Xn−m + q1(X), we get
g = fq + r and deg(r) < m = deg(f).
We now prove uniqueness. If
g = fq1 + r1 = fq2 + r2,
with deg(r1) < deg(f) and deg(r2) < deg(f), we get
f(q1 − q2) = r2 − r1.
If q2 − q1 6 = 0, since the leading coefficient am of f is invertible, by Proposition 30.1, we have
deg(r2 − r1) = deg(f(q1 − q2)) = deg(f) + deg(q2 − q1),
and so, deg(r2−r1) ≥ deg(f), which contradicts the fact that deg(r1) < deg(f) and deg(r2) <
deg(f). Thus, q1 = q2, and then also r1 = r2.
It should be noted that the proof of Proposition 30.4 actually provides an algorithm for
finding the quotient q and the remainder r of the division of g by f. This algorithm is
called the Euclidean algorithm, or division algorithm. Note that the division of g by f is
always possible when f is a monic polynomial, since 1 is invertible. Also, when A is a field,
am 6 = 0 is always invertible, and thus, the division can always be performed. We say that f
divides g when r = 0 in the result of the division g = fq + r. We now draw some important
consequences of the existence of the Euclidean algorithm.
1060 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
30.4 Ideals, PID’s, and Greatest Common Divisors
First, we introduce the fundamental concept of an ideal.
Definition 30.4. Given a ring A, an ideal of A is any nonempty subset I of A satisfying
the following two properties:
(ID1) If a, b ∈ I, then b − a ∈ I.
(ID2) If a ∈ I, then ax ∈ I for every x ∈ A.
An ideal I is a principal ideal if there is some a ∈ I, called a generator , such that
I = {ax | x ∈ A}.
The equality I = {ax | x ∈ A} is also written as I = aA or as I = (a). The ideal
I = (0) = {0} is called the null ideal (or zero ideal).
An ideal I is a maximal ideal if I 6 = A and for every ideal J 6 = A, if I ⊆ J, then J = I.
An ideal I is a prime ideal if I 6 = A and if ab ∈ I, then a ∈ I or b ∈ I, for all a, b ∈ A.
Equivalently, I is a prime ideal if I 6 = A and if a, b ∈ A−I, then ab ∈ A−I, for all a, b ∈ A.
In other words, A − I is closed under multiplication and 1 ∈ A − I.
Note that if I is an ideal, then I = A iff 1 ∈ I. Since by definition, an ideal I is nonempty,
there is some a ∈ I, and by (ID1) we get 0 = a − a ∈ I. Then, for every a ∈ I, since 0 ∈ I,
by (ID1) we get −a ∈ I. Thus, an ideal is an additive subgroup of A. Because of (ID2), an
ideal is also a subring.
Observe that if A is a field, then A only has two ideals, namely, the trivial ideal (0) and
A itself. Indeed, if I 6 = (0), because every nonnull element has an inverse, then 1 ∈ I, and
thus, I = A.
Definition 30.5. Given a ring A, for any two elements a, b ∈ A we say that b is a multiple
of a and that a divides b if b = ac for some c ∈ A; this is usually denoted by a | b.
Note that the principal ideal (a) is the set of all multiples of a, and that a divides b iff b
is a multiple of a iff b ∈ (a) iff (b) ⊆ (a).
Note that every a ∈ A divides 0. However, it is customary to say that a is a zero divisor
iff ac = 0 for some c 6 = 0. With this convention, 0 is a zero divisor unless A = {0} (the
trivial ring), and A is an integral domain iff 0 is the only zero divisor in A.
Given a, b ∈ A with a, b 6 = 0, if (a) = (b) then there exist c, d ∈ A such that a = bc and
b = ad. From this, we get a = adc and b = bcd, that is, a(1−dc) = 0 and b(1−cd) = 0. If A
is an integral domain, we get dc = 1 and cd = 1, that is, c is invertible with inverse d. Thus,
when A is an integral domain, we have b = ad, with d invertible. The converse is obvious, if
b = ad with d invertible, then (a) = (b).
It is worth recording this fact as the following proposition.
30.4. IDEALS, PID’S, AND GREATEST COMMON DIVISORS 1061
Proposition 30.5. If A is an integral domain, for any a, b ∈ A with a, b 6 = 0, we have
(a) = (b) iff there exists some invertible d ∈ A such that b = ad.
An invertible element u ∈ A is also called a unit.
Given two ideals I and J, their sum
I + J = {a + b | a ∈ I, b ∈ J}
is clearly an ideal. Given any nonempty subset J of A, the set
{a1x1 + · · · + anxn | x1, . . . , xn ∈ A, a1, . . . , an ∈ J, n ≥ 1}
is easily seen to be an ideal, and in fact, it is the smallest ideal containing J. It is usually
denoted by (J).
Ideals play a very important role in the study of rings. They tend to show up everywhere.
For example, they arise naturally from homomorphisms.
Proposition 30.6. Given any ring homomorphism h: A → B, the kernel Ker h = {a ∈ A |
h(a) = 0} of h is an ideal.
Proof. Given a, b ∈ A, we have a, b ∈ Ker h iff h(a) = h(b) = 0, and since h is a homomor￾phism, we get
h(b − a) = h(b) − h(a) = 0,
and
h(ax) = h(a)h(x) = 0
for all x ∈ A, which shows that Ker h is an ideal.
There is a sort of converse property. Given a ring A and an ideal I ⊆ A, we can define
the quotient ring A/I, and there is a surjective homomorphism π : A → A/I whose kernel
is precisely I.
Proposition 30.7. Given any ring A and any ideal I ⊆ A, the equivalence relation ≡I
defined by a ≡I b iff b − a ∈ I is a congruence, which means that if a1 ≡I b1 and a2 ≡I b2,
then
1. a1 + a2 ≡I b1 + b2, and
2. a1a2 ≡I b1b2.
Then, the set A/I of equivalence classes modulo I is a ring under the operations
[a] + [b] = [a + b]
[a][b] = [ab].
The map π : A → A/I such that π(a) = [a] is a surjective homomorphism whose kernel is
precisely I.
1062 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
Proof. Everything is straightforward. For example, if a1 ≡I b1 and a2 ≡I b2, then b1 −a1 ∈ I
and b2 − a2 ∈ I. Since I is an ideal, we get
(b1 − a1)b2 = b1b2 − a1b2 ∈ I
and
(b2 − a2)a1 = a1b2 − a1a2 ∈ I.
Since I is an ideal, and thus, an additive group, we get
b1b2 − a1a2 ∈ I,
i.e., a1a2 ≡I b1b2. The equality Ker π = I holds because I is an ideal.
Example 30.1.
1. In the ring Z, for every p ∈ Z, the subroup pZ is an ideal, and Z/pZ is a ring, the ring
of residues modulo p. This ring is a field iff p is a prime number.
2. The quotient of the polynomial ring R[X] by a prime ideal I is an integral domain.
3. The quotient of the polynomial ring R[X] by a maximal ideal I is a field. For example,
if I = (X2 + 1), the principal ideal generated by X2 + 1 (which is indeed a maximal
ideal since X2 + 1 has no real roots), then R[X]/(X2 + 1) ∼= C.
The following proposition yields a characterization of prime ideals and maximal ideals in
terms of quotients.
Proposition 30.8. Given a ring A, for any ideal I ⊆ A, the following properties hold.
(1) The ideal I is a prime ideal iff A/I is an integral domain.
(2) The ideal I is a maximal ideal iff A/I is a field.
Proof. (1) Assume that I is a prime ideal. Since I is prime, I 6 = A, and thus, A/I is not the
trivial ring (0). If [a][b] = 0, since [a][b] = [ab], we have ab ∈ I, and since I is prime, then
either a ∈ I or b ∈ I, so that either [a] = 0 or [b] = 0. Thus, A/I is an integral domain.
Conversely, assume that A/I is an integral domain. Since A/I is not the trivial ring,
I 6 = A. Assume that ab ∈ I. Then, we have
π(ab) = π(a)π(b) = 0,
which implies that either π(a) = 0 or π(b) = 0, since A/I is an integral domain (where
π : A → A/I is the quotient map). Thus, either a ∈ I or b ∈ I, and I is a prime ideal.
30.4. IDEALS, PID’S, AND GREATEST COMMON DIVISORS 1063
(2) Assume that I is a maximal ideal. As in (1), A/I is not the trivial ring (0). Let
[a] 6 = 0 in A/I. We need to prove that [a] has a multiplicative inverse. Since [a] 6 = 0, we
have a /∈ I. Let Ia be the ideal generated by I and a. We have
I ⊆ Ia and I 6 = Ia,
since a /∈ I, and since I is maximal, this implies that
Ia = A.
However, we know that
Ia = {ax + h | x ∈ A, h ∈ I},
and thus, there is some x ∈ A so that
ax + h = 1,
which proves that [a][x] = [1], as desired.
Conversely, assume that A/I is a field. Again, since A/I is not the trivial ring, I 6 = A.
Let J be any proper ideal such that I ⊆ J, and assume that I 6 = J. Thus, there is some
j ∈ J − I, and since Ker π = I, we have π(j) 6 = 0. Since A/I is a field and π is surjective,
there is some k ∈ A so that π(j)π(k) = 1, which implies that
jk − 1 = i
for some i ∈ I, and since I ⊂ J and J is an ideal, it follows that 1 = jk − i ∈ J, showing
that J = A, a contradiction. Therefore, I = J, and I is a maximal ideal.
As a corollary, we obtain the following useful result. It emphasizes the importance of
maximal ideals.
Corollary 30.9. Given any ring A, every maximal ideal I in A is a prime ideal.
Proof. If I is a maximal ideal, then, by Proposition 30.8, the quotient ring A/I is a field.
However, a field is an integral domain, and by Proposition 30.8 (again), I is a prime ideal.
Observe that a ring A is an integral domain iff (0) is a prime ideal. This is an example
of a prime ideal which is not a maximal ideal, as immediately seen in A = Z, where (p) is a
maximal ideal for every prime number p.

A less obvious example of a prime ideal which is not a maximal ideal is the ideal (X) in
the ring of polynomials Z[X]. Indeed, (X, 2) is also a prime ideal, but (X) is properly
contained in (X, 2). The ideal (X) is the set of all polynomials of the form XQ(X) for any
Q(X) ∈ Z[X], in other words the set of all polynomials in Z[X] with constant term equal to
0, and the ideal (X, 2) is the set of all polynomials of the form
XQ1(X) + 2Q2(X), Q1(X), Q2(X) ∈ Z[X],
1064 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
which is just the set of all polynomials in Z[X] whose constant term is of the form 2c for
some c ∈ Z. The ideal (X) is indeed properly contained in the ideal (X, 2). If P(X)Q(X) ∈
(X, 2), let a be the constant term in P(X) and let b be the constant term in Q(X). Since
P(X)Q(X) ∈ (X, 2), we must have ab = 2c for some c ∈ Z, and since 2 is prime, either a is
divisible by 2 or b is divisible by 2. It follows that either P(X) ∈ (X, 2) or Q(X) ∈ (X, 2),
which shows that (X, 2) is a prime ideal.
Definition 30.6. An integral domain in which every ideal is a principal ideal is called a
principal ring or principal ideal domain, for short, a PID.
The ring Z is a PID. This is a consequence of the existence of a (Euclidean) division
algorithm. As we shall see next, when K is a field, the ring K[X] is also a principal ring.

However, when n ≥ 2, the ring K[X1, . . . , Xn] is not principal. For example, in the ring
K[X, Y ], the ideal (X, Y ) generated by X and Y is not principal. First, since (X, Y )
is the set of all polynomials of the form Xq1 + Y q2, where q1, q2 ∈ K[X, Y ], except when
Xq1 + Y q2 = 0, we have deg(Xq1 + Y q2) ≥ 1. Thus, 1 ∈/ (X, Y ). Now if there was some p ∈
K[X, Y ] such that (X, Y ) = (p), since 1 ∈/ (X, Y ), we must have deg(p) ≥ 1. But we would
also have X = pq1 and Y = pq2, for some q1, q2 ∈ K[X, Y ]. Since deg(X) = deg(Y ) = 1,
this is impossible.
Even though K[X, Y ] is not a principal ring, a suitable version of unique factorization in
terms of irreducible factors holds. The ring K[X, Y ] (and more generally K[X1, . . . , Xn]) is
what is called a unique factorization domain, for short, UFD, or a factorial ring.
From this point until Definition 30.11, we consider polynomials in one variable over a
field K.
Remark: Although we already proved part (1) of Proposition 30.10 in a more general
situation above, we reprove it in the special case of polynomials. This may offend the
purists, but most readers will probably not mind.
Proposition 30.10. Let K be a field. The following properties hold:
(1) For any two nonzero polynomials f, g ∈ K[X], (f) = (g) iff there is some λ 6 = 0 in K
such that g = λf.
(2) For every nonnull ideal I in K[X], there is a unique monic polynomial f ∈ K[X] such
that I = (f).
Proof. (1) If (f) = (g), there are some nonzero polynomials q1, q2 ∈ K[X] such that g = fq1
and f = gq2. Thus, we have f = fq1q2, which implies f(1 − q1q2) = 0. Since K is a
field, by Proposition 30.1, K[X] has no zero divisor, and since we assumed f 6 = 0, we must
have q1q2 = 1. However, if either q1 or q2 is not a constant, by Proposition 30.1 again,
deg(q1q2) = deg(q1) + deg(q2) ≥ 1, contradicting q1q2 = 1, since deg(1) = 0. Thus, both
q1, q2 ∈ K − {0}, and (1) holds with λ = q1. In the other direction, it is obvious that g = λf
implies that (f) = (g).
30.4. IDEALS, PID’S, AND GREATEST COMMON DIVISORS 1065
(2) Since we are assuming that I is not the null ideal, there is some polynomial of smallest
degree in I, and since K is a field, by suitable multiplication by a scalar, we can make sure
that this polynomial is monic. Thus, let f be a monic polynomial of smallest degree in I.
By (ID2), it is clear that (f) ⊆ I. Now, let g ∈ I. Using the Euclidean algorithm, there
exist unique q, r ∈ K[X] such that
g = qf + r and deg(r) < deg(f).
If r 6 = 0, there is some λ 6 = 0 in K such that λr is a monic polynomial, and since λr =
λg − λqf, with f, g ∈ I, by (ID1) and (ID2), we have λr ∈ I, where deg(λr) < deg(f) and
λr is a monic polynomial, contradicting the minimality of the degree of f. Thus, r = 0, and
g ∈ (f). The uniqueness of the monic polynomial f follows from (1).
Proposition 30.10 shows that K[X] is a principal ring when K is a field.
We now investigate the existence of a greatest common divisor (gcd) for two nonzero
polynomials. Given any two nonzero polynomials f, g ∈ K[X], recall that f divides g if
g = fq for some q ∈ K[X].
Definition 30.7. Given any two nonzero polynomials f, g ∈ K[X], a polynomial d ∈ K[X]
is a greatest common divisor of f and g (for short, a gcd of f and g) if d divides f and g and
whenever h ∈ K[X] divides f and g, then h divides d. We say that f and g are relatively
prime if 1 is a gcd of f and g.
Note that f and g are relatively prime iff all of their gcd’s are constants (scalars in K),
or equivalently, if f, g have no divisor q of degree deg(q) ≥ 1.

In particular, note that f and g are relatively prime when f is a nonzero constant
polynomial (a scalar λ 6 = 0 in K) and g is any nonzero polynomial.
We can characterize gcd’s of polynomials as follows.
Proposition 30.11. Let K be a field and let f, g ∈ K[X] be any two nonzero polynomials.
For every polynomial d ∈ K[X], the following properties are equivalent:
(1) The polynomial d is a gcd of f and g.
(2) The polynomial d divides f and g and there exist u, v ∈ K[X] such that
d = uf + vg.
(3) The ideals (f),(g), and (d) satisfy the equation
(d) = (f) + (g).
In addition, d 6 = 0, and d is unique up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar in K.
1066 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
Proof. Given any two nonzero polynomials u, v ∈ K[X], observe that u divides v iff (v) ⊆ (u).
Now, (2) can be restated as (f) ⊆ (d), (g) ⊆ (d), and d ∈ (f) + (g), which is equivalent to
(d) = (f) + (g), namely (3).
If (2) holds, since d = uf + vg, whenever h ∈ K[X] divides f and g, then h divides d,
and d is a gcd of f and g.
Assume that d is a gcd of f and g. Then, since d divides f and d divides g, we have
(f) ⊆ (d) and (g) ⊆ (d), and thus (f) + (g) ⊆ (d), and (f) + (g) is nonempty since f and
g are nonzero. By Proposition 30.10, there exists a monic polynomial d1 ∈ K[X] such that
(d1) = (f) + (g). Then, d1 divides both f and g, and since d is a gcd of f and g, then d1
divides d, which shows that (d) ⊆ (d1) = (f) + (g). Consequently, (f) + (g) = (d), and (3)
holds.
Since (d) = (f) + (g) and f and g are nonzero, the last part of the proposition is
obvious.
As a consequence of Proposition 30.11, two nonzero polynomials f, g ∈ K[X] are rela￾tively prime iff there exist u, v ∈ K[X] such that
uf + vg = 1.
The identity
d = uf + vg
of part (2) of Proposition 30.11 is often called the Bezout identity.
We derive more useful consequences of Proposition 30.11.
Proposition 30.12. Let K be a field and let f, g ∈ K[X] be any two nonzero polynomials.
For every gcd d ∈ K[X] of f and g, the following properties hold:
(1) For every nonzero polynomial q ∈ K[X], the polynomial dq is a gcd of fq and gq.
(2) For every nonzero polynomial q ∈ K[X], if q divides f and g, then d/q is a gcd of f/q
and g/q.
Proof. (1) By Proposition 30.11 (2), d divides f and g, and there exist u, v ∈ K[X], such
that
d = uf + vg.
Then, dq divides fq and gq, and
dq = ufq + vgq.
By Proposition 30.11 (2), dq is a gcd of fq and gq. The proof of (2) is similar.
The following proposition is used often.
30.4. IDEALS, PID’S, AND GREATEST COMMON DIVISORS 1067
Proposition 30.13. (Euclid’s proposition) Let K be a field and let f, g, h ∈ K[X] be any
nonzero polynomials. If f divides gh and f is relatively prime to g, then f divides h.
Proof. From Proposition 30.11, f and g are relatively prime iff there exist some polynomials
u, v ∈ K[X] such that
uf + vg = 1.
Then, we have
ufh + vgh = h,
and since f divides gh, it divides both ufh and vgh, and so, f divides h.
Proposition 30.14. Let K be a field and let f, g1, . . . , gm ∈ K[X] be some nonzero polyno￾mials. If f and gi are relatively prime for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, then f and g1 · · · gm are relatively
prime.
Proof. We proceed by induction on m. The case m = 1 is trivial. Let h = g2 · · · gm. By the
induction hypothesis, f and h are relatively prime. Let d be a gcd of f and g1h. We claim
that d is relatively prime to g1. Otherwise, d and g1 would have some nonconstant gcd d1
which would divide both f and g1, contradicting the fact that f and g1 are relatively prime.
Now, by Proposition 30.13, since d divides g1h and d and g1 are relatively prime, d divides
h = g2 · · · gm. But then, d is a divisor of f and h, and since f and h are relatively prime, d
must be a constant, and f and g1 · · · gm are relatively prime.
Definition 30.7 is generalized to any finite number of polynomials as follows.
Definition 30.8. Given any nonzero polynomials f1, . . . , fn ∈ K[X], where n ≥ 2, a poly￾nomial d ∈ K[X] is a greatest common divisor of f1, . . . , fn (for short, a gcd of f1, . . . , fn)
if d divides each fi and whenever h ∈ K[X] divides each fi
, then h divides d. We say that
f1, . . . , fn are relatively prime if 1 is a gcd of f1, . . . , fn.
It is easily shown that Proposition 30.11 can be generalized to any finite number of
polynomials, and similarly for its relevant corollaries. The details are left as an exercise.
Proposition 30.15. Let K be a field and let f1, . . . , fn ∈ K[X] be any n ≥ 2 nonzero
polynomials. For every polynomial d ∈ K[X], the following properties are equivalent:
(1) The polynomial d is a gcd of f1, . . . , fn.
(2) The polynomial d divides each fi and there exist u1, . . . , un ∈ K[X] such that
d = u1f1 + · · · + unfn.
(3) The ideals (fi), and (d) satisfy the equation
(d) = (f1) + · · · + (fn).
1068 CHAPTER 30. POLYNOMIALS, IDEALS AND PID’S
In addition, d 6 = 0, and d is unique up to multiplication by a nonzero scalar in K.
As a consequence of Proposition 30.15, some polynomials f1, . . . , fn ∈ K[X] are relatively
prime iff there exist u1, . . . , un ∈ K[X] such that
u1f1 + · · · + unfn = 1.
The identity
u1f1 + · · · + unfn = 1
of part (2) of Proposition 30.15 is also called the Bezout identity.
We now consider the factorization of polynomials of a single variable into irreducible
factors.
30.5 Factorization and Irreducible Factors in K[X]
Definition 30.9. Given a field K, a polynomial p ∈ K[X] is irreducible or indecomposable
or prime if deg(p) ≥ 1 and if p is not divisible by any polynomial q ∈ K[X] such that
1 ≤ deg(q) < deg(p). Equivalently, p is irreducible if deg(p) ≥ 1 and if p = q1q2, then either
q1 ∈ K or q2 ∈ K (and of course, q1 6 = 0, q2 6 = 0).
Example 30.2. Every polynomial aX + b of degree 1 is irreducible. Over the field R, the
polynomial X2 + 1 is irreducible (why?), but X3 + 1 is not irreducible, since
X
3 + 1 = (X + 1)(X
2 − X + 1).
The polynomial X2 − X + 1 is irreducible over R (why?). It would seem that X4 + 1 is
irreducible over R, but in fact,
X
4 + 1 = (X
2 −
√
2X + 1)(X
2 +
√
2X + 1).
However, in view of the above factorization, X4 + 1 is irreducible over Q.
It can be shown that the irreducible polynomials over R are the polynomials of degree 1,
or the polynomials of degree 2 of the form aX2 + bX + c, for which b
2 − 4ac < 0 (i.e., those
having no real roots). This is not easy to prove! Over the complex numbers C, the only
irreducible polynomials are those of degree 1. This is a version of a fact often referred to as
the “Fundamental theorem of Algebra”, or, as the French sometimes say, as “d’Alembert’s
theorem”!
We already observed that for any two nonzero polynomials f, g ∈ K[X], f divides g iff
(g) ⊆ (f). In view of the definition of a maximal ideal given in Definition 30.4, we now prove
that a polynomial p ∈ K[X] is irreducible iff (p) is a maximal ideal in K[X].
Proposition 30.16. A polynomial p ∈ K[X] is irreducible iff (p) is a maximal ideal in
K[X].
30.5. FACTORIZATION AND IRREDUCIBLE FACTORS IN K[X] 1069
Proof. Since K[X] is an integral domain, for all nonzero polynomials p, q ∈ K[X], deg(pq) =
deg(p) + deg(q), and thus, (p) 6 = K[X] iff deg(p) ≥ 1. Assume that p ∈ K[X] is irreducible.
Since every ideal in K[X] is a principal ideal, every ideal in K[X] is of the form (q), for
some q ∈ K[X]. If (p) ⊆ (q), with deg(q) ≥ 1, then q divides p, and since p ∈ K[X] is
irreducible, this implies that p = λq for some λ 6 = 0 in K, and so, (p) = (q). Thus, (p) is a
maximal ideal. Conversely, assume that (p) is a maximal ideal. Then, as we showed above,
deg(p) ≥ 1, and if q divides p, with deg(q) ≥ 1, then (p) ⊆ (q), and since (p) is a maximal
ideal, this implies that (p) = (q), which means that p = λq for some λ 6 = 0 in K, and so, p
is irreducible.
Let p ∈ K[X] be irreducible. Then, for every nonzero polynomial g ∈ K[X], either p and
g are relatively prime, or p divides g. Indeed, if d is any gcd of p and g, if d is a constant, then
p and g are relatively prime, and if not, because p is irreducible, we have d = λp for some
λ 6 = 0 in K, and thus, p divides g. As a consequence, if p, q ∈ K[X] are both irreducible,
then either p and q are relatively prime, or p = λq for some λ 6 = 0 in K. In particular, if
p, q ∈ K[X] are both irreducible monic polynomials and p 6 = q, then p and q are relatively
prime.
We now prove the (unique) factorization of polynomials into irreducible factors.
