If the field K has positive characteristic, then it is possible that n1! · · · nk! = 0, and
this is why we required K to be of characteristic 0 in order for Proposition 33.30 to
hold.
2. The canonical isomorphism of Proposition 33.30 holds under more general conditions.
Namely, that K is a commutative algebra with identity over Q, and that the E is
a finitely-generated projective K-module (see Definition 35.7). See Bourbaki, [25]
(Chapter III, §11, Section 5, Proposition 8).
The map from E
n
to Sn
(E) given by (u1, . . . , un) 7→ u1  · · ·  un yields a surjection
π : E
⊗n → S
n
(E). Because we are dealing with vector spaces, this map has some section; that
is, there is some injection η : Sn
(E) → E
⊗n with π◦η = id. Since our field K has characteristic
0, there is a special section having a natural definition involving a symmetrization process
defined as follows: For every permutation σ, we have the map rσ : E
n → E
⊗n given by
rσ(u1, . . . , un) = uσ(1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ uσ(n)
.
As rσ is clearly multilinear, rσ extends to a linear map (rσ)⊗ : E
⊗n → E
⊗n making the
following diagram commute

and we get a map Sn × E

σ · z = (rσ)⊗(z).
It is immediately checked that this is a left action of the symmetric group Sn on E

the tensors z ∈ E

such that
σ · z = z, for all σ ∈ Sn

Clearly, η (Sn

S = η ◦ π : E
⊗n −→ E
⊗n where π is the surjection π : E

(E), it is easy to check
that S ◦ S = S. Therefore, S is a projection, and by linear algebra, we know that
E
⊗n = S(E

) ⊕ Ker S = η (Sn
(E)) ⊕ Ker S.
It turns out that Ker S = E
⊗n ∩I = Ker π, where I is the two-sided ideal of T(E) generated
by all tensors of the form u ⊗ v − v ⊗ u ∈ E
⊗2
(for example, see Knapp [104], Appendix A).
Therefore, η is injective,
E
⊗n = η (Sn

and the symmetric tensor power Sn

.
33.11 Symmetric Algebras
As in the case of tensors, we can pack together all the symmetric powers Sn
(V ) into an
algebra.
Definition 33.20. Given a vector space V , the space
S(V ) = M
m≥0
S
m(V ),
is called the symmetric tensor algebra of V .
We could adapt what we did in Section 33.6 for general tensor powers to symmetric
tensors but since we already have the algebra T(V ), we can proceed faster. If I is the
two-sided ideal generated by all tensors of the form u ⊗ v − v ⊗ u ∈ V
⊗2
, we set
S
•
(V ) = T(V )/I.
Observe that since the ideal I is generated by elements in V
⊗2
, every tensor in I is a linear
combination of tensors of the form ω1 ⊗ (u ⊗ v − v ⊗ u) ⊗ ω2, with ω1 ∈ V
⊗n1 and ω2 ∈ V
⊗n2
for some n1, n2 ∈ N, which implies that
I =
M
m≥0
(I ∩ V
⊗m).
1192 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
Then, S•
(V ) automatically inherits a multiplication operation which is commutative, and
since T(V ) is graded, that is
T(V ) = M
m≥0
V
⊗m,
we have
S
•
(V ) = M
m≥0
V
⊗m/(I ∩ V
⊗m).
However, it is easy to check that
S
m(V ) ∼= V
⊗m/(I ∩ V
⊗m),
so
S
•
(V ) ∼= S(V ).
When V is of finite dimension n, S(V ) corresponds to the algebra of polynomials with
coefficients in K in n variables (this can be seen from Proposition 33.28). When V is of
infinite dimension and (ui)i∈I is a basis of V , the algebra S(V ) corresponds to the algebra
of polynomials in infinitely many variables in I. What’s nice about the symmetric tensor
algebra S(V ) is that it provides an intrinsic definition of a polynomial algebra in any set of
I variables.
It is also easy to see that S(V ) satisfies the following universal mapping property.
Proposition 33.31. Given any commutative K-algebra A, for any linear map f : V → A,
there is a unique K-algebra homomorphism f : S(V ) → A so that
f = f ◦ i,
as in the diagram below.

(E; K),
(f · g)(u1, . . . , um+n) = X

Exterior Tensor Powers and Exterior
Algebras
34.1 Exterior Tensor Powers
In this chapter we consider alternating (also called skew-symmetric) multilinear maps and
exterior tensor powers (also called alternating tensor powers), denoted V n
(E). In many
respects alternating multilinear maps and exterior tensor powers can be treated much like
symmetric tensor powers, except that sgn(σ) needs to be inserted in front of the formulae
valid for symmetric powers.
Roughly speaking, we are now in the world of determinants rather than in the world of
permanents. However, there are also some fundamental differences, one of which being that
the exterior tensor power V n
(E) is the trivial vector space (0) when E is finite-dimensional
and when n > dim(E). This chapter provides the firm foundations for understanding differ￾ential forms.
As in the case of symmetric tensor powers, since we already have the tensor algebra T(V ),
we can proceed rather quickly. But first let us review some basic definitions and facts.
Definition 34.1. Let f : E
n → F be a multilinear map. We say that f alternating iff
for all ui ∈ E, f(u1, . . . , un) = 0 whenever ui = ui+1, for some i with 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1;
that is, f(u1, . . . , un) = 0 whenever two adjacent arguments are identical. We say that f is
skew-symmetric (or anti-symmetric) iff
f(uσ(1), . . . , uσ(n)) = sgn(σ)f(u1, . . . , un),
for every permutation σ ∈ Sn, and all ui ∈ E.
For n = 1, we agree that every linear map f : E → F is alternating. The vector space of
all multilinear alternating maps f : E
n → F is denoted Altn
(E; F). Note that Alt1
(E; F) =
Hom(E, F). The following basic proposition shows the relationship between alternation and
skew-symmetry.
1197
1198 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
Proposition 34.1. Let f : E
n → F be a multilinear map. If f is alternating, then the
following properties hold:
(1) For all i, with 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1,
f(. . . , ui
, ui+1, . . .) = −f(. . . , ui+1, ui
, . . .).
(2) For every permutation σ ∈ Sn,
f(uσ(1), . . . , uσ(n)) = sgn(σ)f(u1, . . . , un).
(3) For all i, j, with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n,
f(. . . , ui
, . . . uj
, . . .) = 0 whenever ui = uj
.
Moreover, if our field K has characteristic different from 2, then every skew-symmetric
multilinear map is alternating.
Proof. (1) By multilinearity applied twice, we have
f(. . . , ui + ui+1, ui + ui+1, . . .) = f(. . . , ui
, ui
, . . .) + f(. . . , ui
, ui+1, . . .)
+ f(. . . , ui+1, ui
, . . .) + f(. . . , ui+1, ui+1, . . .).
Since f is alternating, we get
0 = f(. . . , ui
, ui+1, . . .) + f(. . . , ui+1, ui
, . . .);
that is, f(. . . , ui
, ui+1, . . .) = −f(. . . , ui+1, ui
, . . .).
(2) Clearly, the symmetric group, Sn, acts on Altn
(E; F) on the left, via
σ · f(u1, . . . , un) = f(uσ(1), . . . , uσ(n)).
Consequently, as Sn is generated by the transpositions (permutations that swap exactly two
elements), since for a transposition, (2) is simply (1), we deduce (2) by induction on the
number of transpositions in σ.
(3) There is a permutation σ that sends ui and uj respectively to u1 and u2. By hypothesis
ui = uj
, so we have uσ(1) = uσ(2), and as f is alternating we have
f(uσ(1), . . . , uσ(n)) = 0.
However, by (2),
f(u1, . . . , un) = sgn(σ)f(uσ(1), . . . , uσ(n)) = 0.
Now when f is skew-symmetric, if σ is the transposition swapping ui and ui+1 = ui
, as
sgn(σ) = −1, we get
f(. . . , ui
, ui
, . . .) = −f(. . . , ui
, ui
, . . .),
34.1. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS 1199
so that
2f(. . . , ui
, ui
, . . .) = 0,
and in every characteristic except 2, we conclude that f(. . . , ui
, ui
, . . .) = 0, namely f is
alternating.
Proposition 34.1 shows that in every characteristic except 2, alternating and skew￾symmetric multilinear maps are identical. Using Proposition 34.1 we easily deduce the
following crucial fact.
Proposition 34.2. Let f : E
n → F be an alternating multilinear map. For any families of
vectors, (u1, . . . , un) and (v1, . . . , vn), with ui
, vi ∈ E, if
vj =
nX
i=1
aijui
, 1 ≤ j ≤ n,
then
f(v1, . . . , vn) = 
σ
X∈Sn
sgn(σ) aσ(1),1 · · · aσ(n),n! f(u1, . . . , un) = det(A)f(u1, . . . , un),
where A is the n × n matrix, A = (aij ).
Proof. Use Property (ii) of Proposition 34.1.
We are now ready to define and construct exterior tensor powers.
Definition 34.2. An n-th exterior tensor power of a vector space E, where n ≥ 1, is a
vector space A together with an alternating multilinear map ϕ: E
n → A, such that for every
vector space F and for every alternating multilinear map f : E
n → F, there is a unique
linear map f∧ : A → F with
f(u1, . . . , un) = f∧(ϕ(u1, . . . , un)),
for all u1, . . . , un ∈ E, or for short
f = f∧ ◦ ϕ.
Equivalently, there is a unique linear map f∧ such that the following diagram commutes:

The above property is called the universal mapping property of the exterior tensor power
(A, ϕ).
1200 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
We now show that any two n-th exterior tensor powers (A1, ϕ1) and (A2, ϕ2) for E are
isomorphic.
Proposition 34.3. Given any two n-th exterior tensor powers (A1, ϕ1) and (A2, ϕ2) for E,
there is an isomorphism h: A1 → A2 such that
ϕ2 = h ◦ ϕ1.
Proof. Replace tensor product by n-th exterior tensor power in the proof of Proposition
33.5.
We next give a construction that produces an n-th exterior tensor power of a vector space
E.
Theorem 34.4. Given a vector space E, an n-th exterior tensor power (
V
n
(E), ϕ) for E
can be constructed (n ≥ 1). Furthermore, denoting ϕ(u1, . . . , un) as u1∧· · ·∧un, the exterior
tensor power V n
(E) is generated by the vectors u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un, where u1, . . . , un ∈ E, and for
every alternating multilinear map f : E
n → F, the unique linear map f∧ :
V
n
(E) → F such
that f = f∧ ◦ ϕ is defined by
f∧(u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un) = f(u1, . . . , un)
on the generators u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un of V n
(E).
Proof sketch. We can give a quick proof using the tensor algebra T(E). Let Ia be the
two-sided ideal of T(E) generated by all tensors of the form u ⊗ u ∈ E
⊗2
. Then let
n^
(E) = E
⊗n
/(Ia ∩ E
⊗n
)
and let π be the projection π : E
⊗n →
V n
(E). If we let u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un = π(u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un), it
is easy to check that (V n
(E), ∧) satisfies the conditions of Theorem 34.4.
Remark: We can also define
^
(E) = T(E)/Ia =
M
n≥0
n^
(E),
the exterior algebra of E. This is the skew-symmetric counterpart of S(E), and we will study
it a little later.
For simplicity of notation, we may write V n E for V n
(E). We also abbreviate “exterior
tensor power” as “exterior power.” Clearly, V 1
(E) ∼= E, and it is convenient to set V 0
(E) =
K.
34.1. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS 1201
The fact that the map ϕ: E
n →

(E) is alternating and multilinear can also be ex￾pressed as follows:
u1 ∧ · · · ∧ (ui + vi) ∧ · · · ∧ un = (u1 ∧ · · · ∧ ui ∧ · · · ∧ un)
+ (u1 ∧ · · · ∧ vi ∧ · · · ∧ un),
u1 ∧ · · · ∧ (λui) ∧ · · · ∧ un = λ(u1 ∧ · · · ∧ ui ∧ · · · ∧ un),
uσ(1) ∧ · · · ∧ uσ(n) = sgn(σ) u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un,
for all σ ∈ Sn.
The map ϕ from E
n
to V n
(E) is often denoted ι∧, so that
ι∧(u1, . . . , un) = u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un.
Theorem 34.4 implies the following result.
Proposition 34.5. There is a canonical isomorphism
Hom(

between the vector space of linear maps Hom(V n
(E), F) and the vector space of alternating
multilinear maps Altn
(E; F), given by the linear map − ◦ ϕ defined by 7→ h ◦ ϕ, with h ∈

Definition 34.3. Tensors α ∈
V
n
(E) are called alternating n-tensors or alternating tensors
of degree n and we write deg(α) = n. Tensors of the form u1∧· · ·∧un, where ui ∈ E, are called
simple (or decomposable) alternating n-tensors. Those alternating n-tensors that are not
simple are often called compound alternating n-tensors. Simple tensors u1∧· · ·∧un ∈
V
n
(E)
are also called n-vectors and tensors in V n
(E

) are often called (alternating) n-forms.
Given a linear map f : E → E
0 , since the map ι
0∧ ◦(f ×f) is bilinear and alternating, there
is a unique linear map f ∧ f :

(f ∧ f)(u ∧ v) = f(u) ∧ f(v).

Proposition 34.6. Given any two linear maps f : E → E
0 and f
0 : E
0 → E
00 , we have
(f
0 ◦ f) ∧ (f
0 ◦ f) = (f

0 ) ◦ (f ∧ f).
The generalization to the alternating product f ∧ · · · ∧ f of n ≥ 3 copies of the linear
map f : E → E
0 is immediate, and left to the reader.
34.2 Bases of Exterior Powers
Definition 34.4. Let E be any vector space. For any basis (ui)i∈Σ for E, we assume that
some total ordering ≤ on the index set Σ has been chosen. Call the pair ((ui)i∈Σ, ≤) an
ordered basis. Then for any nonempty finite subset I ⊆ Σ, let
uI = ui1 ∧ · · · ∧ uim,
where I = {i1, . . . , im}, with i1 < · · · < im.
Since V n
(E) is generated by the tensors of the form v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn, with vi ∈ E, in view of
skew-symmetry, it is clear that the tensors uI with |I| = n generate V n
(E) (where ((ui)i∈Σ, ≤)
is an ordered basis). Actually they form a basis. To gain an intuitive understanding of this
statement, let m = 2 and E be a 3-dimensional vector space lexicographically ordered basis
{e1, e2, e3}. We claim that
e1 ∧ e2, e1 ∧ e3, e2 ∧ e3
form a basis for V 2
(E) since they not only generate V 2
(E) but are linearly independent.
The linear independence is argued as follows: given any vector space F, if w12, w13, w23 are
any vectors in F, there is an alternating bilinear map h: E
2 → F such that
h(e1, e2) = w12, h(e1, e3) = w13, h(e2, e3) = w23.
Because h yields a unique linear map h∧ :
V
2 E → F such that
h∧(ei ∧ ej ) = wij , 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3,
by Proposition 33.4, the vectors
e1 ∧ e2, e1 ∧ e3, e2 ∧ e3
are linearly independent. This suggests understanding how an alternating bilinear function
f : E
2 → F is expressed in terms of its values f(ei
, ej ) on the basis vectors (e1, e2, e3). Using
bilinearity and alternation, we obtain
f(u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3, v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3) = (u1v2 − u2v1)f(e1, e2) + (u1v3 − u3v1)f(e1, e3)
+ (u2v3 − u3v2)f(e2, e3).
34.2. BASES OF EXTERIOR POWERS 1203
Therefore, given w12, w13, w23 ∈ F, the function h given by
h(u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3, v1e1 + v2e2 + v3e3) = (u1v2 − u2v1)w12 + (u1v3 − u3v1)w13
+ (u2v3 − u3v2)w23
is clearly bilinear and alternating, and by construction h(ei
, ej ) = wij , with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 3
does the job.
We now prove the assertion that tensors uI with |I| = n generate V n
(E) for arbitrary n.
Proposition 34.7. Given any vector space E, if E has finite dimension d = dim(E), then
for all n > d, the exterior power V n
(E) is trivial; that is V n
(E) = (0). If n ≤ d or if E
is infinite dimensional, then for every ordered basis ((ui)i∈Σ, ≤), the family (uI ) is basis of
V
n
(E), where I ranges over finite nonempty subsets of Σ of size |I| = n.
Proof. First assume that E has finite dimension d = dim(E) and that n > d. We know that
V
n
(E) is generated by the tensors of the form v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn, with vi ∈ E. If u1, . . . , ud is a
basis of E, as every vi
is a linear combination of the uj
, when we expand v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn using
multilinearity, we get a linear combination of the form
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn =
X
(j1,...,jn)
λ(j1,...,jn) uj1 ∧ · · · ∧ ujn
,
where each (j1, . . . , jn) is some sequence of integers jk ∈ {1, . . . , d}. As n > d, each sequence
(j1, . . . , jn) must contain two identical elements. By alternation, uj1 ∧ · · · ∧ ujn = 0, and so
v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn = 0. It follows that V n
(E) = (0).
Now assume that either dim(E) = d and n ≤ d, or that E is infinite dimensional. The
argument below shows that the uI are nonzero and linearly independent. As usual, let
u
∗
i ∈ E
∗ be the linear form given by
u
∗
i
(uj ) = δij .
For any nonempty subset I = {i1, . . . , in} ⊆ Σ with i1 < · · · < in, for any n vectors
v1, . . . , vn ∈ E, let
lI (v1, . . . , vn) = det(u

If we let the n-tuple (v1, . . . , vn) vary we obtain a map lI from E
n
to K, and it is easy
to check that this map is alternating multilinear. Thus lI induces a unique linear map
