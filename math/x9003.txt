The Koch curve is an example of a continuous curve which is nowhere differentiable
(because it “wiggles” too much). It is a curve of infinite length. The result of 6 iterations,
starting with the line segment ((−1, 0),(1, 0)), is shown in Figure 38.5.
The curve obtained by putting three Kock curves together on the sides of an equilateral
triangle is known as the snowflake curve (for obvious reasons, see below!).

Differential Calculus
39.1 Directional Derivatives, Total Derivatives
This chapter contains a review of basic notions of differential calculus. First, we review
the definition of the derivative of a function f : R → R. Next, we define directional deriva￾tives and the total derivative of a function f : E → F between normed affine spaces. Basic
properties of derivatives are shown, including the chain rule. We show how derivatives are
represented by Jacobian matrices. The mean value theorem is stated, as well as the implicit
function theorem and the inverse function theorem. Diffeomorphisms and local diffeomor￾phisms are defined. Tangent spaces are defined. Higher-order derivatives are defined, as well
as the Hessian. Schwarz’s lemma (about the commutativity of partials) is stated. Several
versions of Taylor’s formula are stated, and a famous formula due to Fa`a di Bruno’s is given.
We first review the notion of the derivative of a real-valued function whose domain is an
open subset of R.
Let f : A → R, where A is a nonempty open subset of R, and consider any a ∈ A.
The main idea behind the concept of the derivative of f at a, denoted by f
0 (a), is that
locally around a (that is, in some small open set U ⊆ A containing a), the function f is
approximated linearly1 by the map
x 7→ f(a) + f
0 (a)(x − a).
As pointed out by Dieudonn´e in the early 1960s, it is an “unfortunate accident” that if
V is vector space of dimension one, then there is a bijection between the space V
∗ of linear
forms defined on V and the field of scalars. As a consequence, the derivative of a real-valued
function f defined on an open subset A of the reals can be defined as the scalar f
0 (a) (for
any a ∈ A). But as soon as f is a function of several arguments, the scalar interpretation of
the derivative breaks down.
1Actually, the approximation is affine, but everybody commits this abuse of language.
1407
1408 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
Part of the difficulty in extending the idea of derivative to more complex spaces is to give
an adequate notion of linear approximation. The key idea is to use linear maps. This could
be carried out in terms of matrices but it turns out that this neither shortens nor simplifies
proofs. In fact, this is often the opposite.
We admit that the more intrinsic definition of the notion of derivative fa
0
at a point a of
a function f : E → F between two normed (affine) spaces E and F as a linear map requires
a greater effort to be grasped, but we feel that the advantages of this definition outweight
its degree of abstraction. In particular, it yields a clear notion of the derivative of a function
f : Mm(R) → Mn(R) defined from m × m matrices to n × n matrices (many definitions
make use of partial derivatives with respect to matrices that do make any sense). But more
importantly, the definition of the derivative as a linear map makes it clear that whether
the space E or the space F is infinite dimensional does not matter. This is important in
optimization theory where the natural space of solutions of the problem is often an infinite
dimensional function space. Of course, to carry out computations one need to pick finite
bases and to use Jacobian matrices, but this is a different matter.
Let us now review the formal definition of the derivative of a real-valued function.
Definition 39.1. Let A be any nonempty open subset of R, and let a ∈ A. For any function
f : A → R, the derivative of f at a ∈ A is the limit (if it exists)
lim
h→0, h∈U
f(a + h) − f(a)
h
,
where U = {h ∈ R | a + h ∈ A, h 6 = 0}. This limit is denoted by f
0 (a), or Df(a), or dx
df (a).
If f
0 (a) exists for every a ∈ A, we say that f is differentiable on A. In this case, the map
a 7→ f
0 (a) is denoted by f
0 , or Df, or dx
df
.
Note that since A is assumed to be open, A − {a} is also open, and since the function
h 7→ a + h is continuous and U is the inverse image of A − {a} under this function, U is
indeed open and the definition makes sense.
We can also define f
0 (a) as follows: there is some function  , such that,
f(a + h) = f(a) + f
0 (a) · h +  (h)h,
whenever a + h ∈ A, where  (h) is defined for all h such that a + h ∈ A, and
lim
h→0, h∈U

(h) = 0.
Remark: We can also define the notion of derivative of f at a on the left, and derivative
of f at a on the right. For example, we say that the derivative of f at a on the left is the
limit f
0 (a−) (if it exists)
lim
h→0, h∈U
f(a + h) − f(a)
h
,
39.1. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES, TOTAL DERIVATIVES 1409
where U = {h ∈ R | a + h ∈ A, h < 0}.
If a function f as in Definition 39.1 has a derivative f
0 (a) at a, then it is continuous at
a. If f is differentiable on A, then f is continuous on A. The composition of differentiable
functions is differentiable.
Remark: A function f has a derivative f
0 (a) at a iff the derivative of f on the left at a and
the derivative of f on the right at a exist, and if they are equal. Also, if the derivative of f
on the left at a exists, then f is continuous on the left at a (and similarly on the right).
We would like to extend the notion of derivative to functions f : A → F, where E and F
are normed affine spaces, and A is some nonempty open subset of E. The first difficulty is
to make sense of the quotient
f(a + h) − f(a)
h
.
If E and F are normed affine spaces, it will be notationally convenient to assume that
the vector space associated with E is denoted by −→E , and that the vector space associated
with F is denoted as −→F .
Since F is a normed affine space, making sense of f(a+h)−f(a) is easy: we can define this
as
−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + h), the unique vector translating f(a) to f(a + h). We should note however,
that this quantity is a vector and not a point. Nevertheless, in defining derivatives, it is
notationally more pleasant to denote
−−−−−−−−−→
f(a)f(a + h) by f(a + h) − f(a). Thus, in the rest of
this chapter, the vector
−→ab will be denoted by b−a. But now, how do we define the quotient
by a vector? Well, we don’t!
A first possibility is to consider the directional derivative with respect to a vector u 6 = 0
in
−→E . We can consider the vector f(a + tu) − f(a), where t ∈ R (or t ∈ C). Now,
f(a + tu) − f(a)
t
makes sense. The idea is that in E, the points of the form a + tu for t in some small interval
[−, + ] in R (or C) form a line segment [r, s] in A containing a, and that the image of
this line segment defines a small curve segment on f(A). This curve segment is defined by
the map t 7→ f(a + tu), from [r, s] to F, and the directional derivative Duf(a) defines the
direction of the tangent line at a to this curve; see Figure 39.1. This leads us to the following
definition.
Definition 39.2. Let E and F be two normed affine spaces, let A be a nonempty open
subset of E, and let f : A → F be any function. For any a ∈ A, for any u 6 = 0 in
−→E , the
directional derivative of f at a w.r.t. the vector u, denoted by Duf(a), is the limit (if it
exists)
lim
t→0, t∈U
f(a + tu) − f(a)
t
,
where U = {t ∈ R | a + tu ∈ A, t 6 = 0} (or U = {t ∈ C | a + tu ∈ A, t 6 = 0}).

Figure 39.1: Let f : R
2 → R. The graph of f is the peach surface in R
3
, and t 7→ f(a + tu)
is the embedded orange curve connecting f(a) to f(a + tu). Then Duf(a) is the slope of the
pink tangent line in the direction of u.
Since the map t 7→ a + tu is continuous, and since A − {a} is open, the inverse image U
of A − {a} under the above map is open, and the definition of the limit in Definition 39.2
makes sense.
Remark: Since the notion of limit is purely topological, the existence and value of a di￾rectional derivative is independent of the choice of norms in E and F, as long as they are
equivalent norms.
The directional derivative is sometimes called the Gˆateaux derivative.
In the special case where E = R and F = R, and we let u = 1 (i.e., the real number 1,
viewed as a vector), it is immediately verified that D1f(a) = f
0 (a), in the sense of Definition
39.1. When E = R (or E = C) and F is any normed vector space, the derivative D1f(a),
also denoted by f
0 (a), provides a suitable generalization of the notion of derivative.
However, when E has dimension ≥ 2, directional derivatives present a serious problem,
which is that their definition is not sufficiently uniform. Indeed, there is no reason to believe
that the directional derivatives w.r.t. all nonnull vectors u share something in common. As
a consequence, a function can have all directional derivatives at a, and yet not be continuous
at a. Two functions may have all directional derivatives in some open sets, and yet their
composition may not.
Example 39.1. Let f : R
2 → R be the function given by
f(x, y) = (
x
2y
x4+y
2
if (x, y) 6 = (0, 0)
0 if (x, y) = (0, 0).
The graph of f(x, y) is illustrated in Figure 39.2.

Figure 39.2: The graph of the function from Example 39.1. Note that f is not continuous
at (0, 0), despite the existence of Duf(0, 0) for all u 6 = 0.
For any u 6 = 0, letting u =

f(0 + tu) − f(0)

,
so that
Duf(0, 0) = 
h
2
k
if k 6 = 0
0 if k = 0.
Thus, Duf(0, 0) exists for all u 6 = 0.
On the other hand, if Df(0, 0) existed, it would be a linear map Df(0, 0): R
2 → R
represented by a row matrix (α β), and we would have Duf(0, 0) = Df(0, 0)(u) = αh + βk,
but the explicit formula for Duf(0, 0) is not linear. As a matter of fact, the function f is
not continuous at (0, 0). For example, on the parabola y = x
2
, f(x, y) = 1
2
, and when we
approach the origin on this parabola, the limit is 1
2
, but f(0, 0) = 0.
To avoid the problems arising with directional derivatives we introduce a more uniform
notion.
Given two normed spaces E and F, recall that a linear map f : E → F is continuous iff
there is some constant C ≥ 0 such that
k
f(u)k ≤ C k uk for all u ∈ E.
1412 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
Definition 39.3. Let E and F be two normed affine spaces, let A be a nonempty open subset
of E, and let f : A → F be any function. For any a ∈ A, we say that f is differentiable at
a ∈ A if there is a linear continuous map L:
−→E →
−→F and a function  , such that
f(a + h) = f(a) + L(h) +  (h)k hk
for every a + h ∈ A, where  (h) is defined for every h such that a + h ∈ A and
lim
h→0, h∈U

(h) = 0,
where U = {h ∈
−→E | a + h ∈ A, h 6 = 0}. The linear map L is denoted by Df(a), or Dfa, or
df(a), or dfa, or f
0 (a), and it is called the Fr´echet derivative, or derivative, or total derivative,
or total differential, or differential, of f at a; see Figure 39.3.

. The linear map
L = Df(a) is the pink tangent plane. For any vector h ∈ R
2
, L(h) is approximately equal
to f(a + h) − f(a). Note that L(h) is also the direction tangent to the curve t 7→ f(a + tu).
Since the map h 7→ a + h from −→E to E is continuous, and since A is open in E, the
inverse image U of A − {a} under the above map is open in −→E , and it makes sense to say
that
lim


(h) = 0.

and that the value  (0) plays absolutely no role in this definition. The condition for f to be
differentiable at a amounts to the fact that
lim
h7→0
k
f(a + h) − f(a) − L(h)k
k

= 0
as h 6 = 0 approaches 0, when a + h ∈ A. However, it does no harm to assume that  (0) = 0,
and we will assume this from now on.
Again, we note that the derivative Df(a) of f at a provides an affine approximation of
f, locally around a.
Remarks:
(1) Since the notion of limit is purely topological, the existence and value of a derivative is
independent of the choice of norms in E and F, as long as they are equivalent norms.
(2) If h: (−a, a) → R is a real-valued function defined on some open interval containing
0, we say that h is o(t) for t → 0, and we write h(t) = o(t), if
lim
t7→0, t6=0
h(t)
t
= 0.
With this notation (the little o notation), the function f is differentiable at a iff
f(a + h) − f(a) − L(h) = o(k hk ),
which is also written as
f(a + h) = f(a) + L(h) + o(k hk ).
The following proposition shows that our new definition is consistent with the definition
of the directional derivative and that the continuous linear map L is unique, if it exists.
Proposition 39.1. Let E and F be two normed affine spaces, let A be a nonempty open
subset of E, and let f : A → F be any function. For any a ∈ A, if Df(a) is defined, then
f is continuous at a and f has a directional derivative Duf(a) for every u 6 = 0 in
−→E , and
furthermore,
Duf(a) = Df(a)(u).
Proof. If L = Df(a) exists, then for any nonzero vector u ∈
−→E , because A is open, for any
t ∈ R − {0} (or t ∈ C − {0}) small enough, a + tu ∈ A, so
f(a + tu) = f(a) + L(tu) +  (tu)k tuk
= f(a) + tL(u) + |t| (tu)k uk

which implies that
L(u) = f(a + tu) − f(a)

(tu)k uk ,
and since limt7→0  (tu) = 0, we deduce that
L(u) = Df(a)(u) = Duf(a).
Because
f(a + h) = f(a) + L(h) +  (h)k hk
for all h such that k hk is small enough, L is continuous, and limh7→0  (h)k hk = 0, we have
limh7→0 f(a + h) = f(a), that is, f is continuous at a.
When E is of finite dimension, every linear map is continuous (see Proposition 9.8 or
Theorem 37.58), and this assumption is then redundant.
It is important to note that the derivative Df(a) of f at a is a continuous linear map
from the vector space
−→E to the vector space
−→F , and not a function from the affine space E
to the affine space F.
Although this may not be immediately obvious, the reason for requiring the linear map
Dfa to be continuous is to ensure that if a function f is differentiable at a, then it is
continuous at a. This is certainly a desirable property of a differentiable function. In finite
dimension this holds, but in infinite dimension this is not the case. The following proposition
shows that if Dfa exists at a and if f is continuous at a, then Dfa must be a continuous
map. So if a function is differentiable at a, then it is continuous iff the linear map Dfa is
continuous. We chose to include the second condition rather that the first in the definition
of a differentiable function.
Proposition 39.2. Let E and F be two normed affine spaces, let A be a nonempty open
subset of E, and let f : A → F be any function. For any a ∈ A, if Dfa is defined, then f is
continuous at a iff Dfa is a continuous linear map.
Proof. Proposition 39.1 shows that if Dfa is defined and continuous then f is continuous at
a. Conversely, assume that Dfa exists and that f is continuous at a. Since f is continuous
at a and since Dfa exists, for any η > 0 there is some ρ with 0 < ρ < 1 such that if k hk ≤ ρ
then
k
f(a + h) − f(a)k ≤ η

and
k
f(a + h) − f(a) − Da(h)k ≤ η

so we have

Da(h)k = k Da(h) − (f(a + h) − f(a)) + f(a + h) − f(a)k

which proves that Dfa is continuous at 0. By Proposition 37.56, Dfa is a continuous linear
map.
Example 39.2. Consider the map, f : Mn(R) → Mn(R), given by
f(A) = A
> A − I,
where Mn(R) is equipped with any matrix norm, since they are all equivalent; for example,
pick the Frobenius norm, k Ak F =
p tr(A> A). We claim that
Df(A)(H) = A
> H + H
> A, for all A and H in Mn(R).
We have
f(A + H) − f(A) − (A

If Df(a) exists for every a ∈ A, we get a map
Df : A → L(
−→E ;
−→F ),
called the derivative of f on A, and also denoted by df. Recall that L(
−→E ;
−→F ) denotes the
vector space of all continuous maps from −→E to
−→F .
We now consider a number of standard results about derivatives.
1416 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
39.2 Properties of Derivatives
Proposition 39.3. Given two normed affine spaces E and F, if f : E → F is a constant
function, then Df(a) = 0, for every a ∈ E. If f : E → F is a continuous affine map, then
Df(a) = −→f , for every a ∈ E, the linear map associated with f.
Proof. Straightforward.
Proposition 39.4. Given a normed affine space E and a normed vector space F, for any
two functions f, g : E → F, for every a ∈ E, if Df(a) and Dg(a) exist, then D(f +g)(a) and
D(λf)(a) exist, and
D(f + g)(a) = Df(a) + Dg(a),
D(λf)(a) = λDf(a).
Proof. Straightforward.
Given two normed vector spaces (E1, k k
1
) and (E2, k k
2
), there are three natural and
equivalent norms that can be used to make E1 × E2 into a normed vector space:
1. k (u1, u2)k
1 = k u1k 1 + k u2k 2
.
2. k (u1, u2)k
2 = (k u1k
2
1 + k u2k
2
2
)
1/2
.
3. k (u1, u2)k ∞ = max(k u1k 1
, k u2k 2
).
We usually pick the first norm. If E1, E2, and F are three normed vector spaces, recall that
a bilinear map f : E1 × E2 → F is continuous iff there is some constant C ≥ 0 such that
k
f(u1, u2)k ≤ C k u1k 1
k
u2k 2
for all u1 ∈ E1 and all u2 ∈ E2.
Proposition 39.5. Given three normed vector spaces E1, E2, and F, for any continuous
bilinear map f : E1 × E2 → F, for every (a, b) ∈ E1 × E2, Df(a, b) exists, and for every
u ∈ E1 and v ∈ E2,
Df(a, b)(u, v) = f(u, b) + f(a, v).
Proof. Since f is bilinear, a simple computation implies that
f((a, b) + (u, v)) − f(a, b) − (f(u, b) + f(a, v)) = f(a + u, b + v) − f(a, b) − f(u, b) − f(a, v)
= f(a + u, b) + f(a + u, v) − f(a, b) − f(u, b) − f(a, v)
= f(a, b) + f(u, b) + f(a, v) + f(u, v) − f(a, b) − f(u, b) − f(a, v)
= f(u, v).

We now state the very useful chain rule.
Theorem 39.6. Given three normed affine spaces E, F, and G, let A be an open set in
E, and let B an open set in F. For any functions f : A → F and g : B → G, such that
f(A) ⊆ B, for any a ∈ A, if Df(a) exists and Dg(f(a)) exists, then D(g ◦ f)(a) exists, and
D(g ◦ f)(a) = Dg(f(a)) ◦ Df(a).
Proof. Since f is differentiable at a and g is differentiable at b = f(a) for every η such that
0 < η < 1 there is some ρ > 0 such that for all s, t, if k sk ≤ ρ and k tk ≤ ρ then
f(a + s) = f(a) + Dfa(s) +  1(s)
g(b + t) = g(b) + Dgb(t) +  2(t),
with k  1(s)k ≤ η k sk and k  2(t)k ≤ η k tk . Since Dfa and Dgb are continuous, we have
k
Dfa(s)k ≤ kDfak k sk and k Dgb(t)k ≤ kDgbk k tk ,
which, since k  1(s)k ≤ η k sk and η < 1, implies that
k
Dfa(s) +  1(s)k ≤ kDfak k sk + k  1(s)k ≤ kDfak k sk + η k sk ≤ (k Dfak + 1) k sk .
Consequently, if k sk < ρ/(k Dfak + 1), we have
k

2(Dfa(s) +  1(s))k ≤ η(k Dfak + 1) k sk (∗1)
and
k
Dgb( 1(s))k ≤ kDgbk k  1(s)k ≤ η k Dgbk k sk . (∗2)
1418 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
Then since b = f(a), using the above we have
(g ◦ f)(a + s) = g(f(a + s)) = g(b + Dfa(s) +  1(s))
= g(b) + Dgb(Dfa(s) +  1(s)) +  2(Dfa(s) +  1(s))
= g(b) + (Dgb ◦ Dfa)(s) + Dgb( 1(s)) +  2(Dfa(s) +  1(s)).
Now by (∗1) and (∗2) we have
k
Dgb( 1(s)) +  2(Dfa(s) +  1(s))k ≤ kDgb( 1(s))k + k  2(Dfa(s) +  1(s))k
≤ η k Dgbk k sk + η(k Dfak + 1) k sk
= η(k Dfak + k Dgbk + 1) k sk ,
so if we write  3(s) = Dgb( 1(s)) +  2(Dfa(s) +  1(s)) we proved that
(g ◦ f)(a + s) = g(b) + (Dgb ◦ Dfa)(s) +  3(s)
with  3(s) ≤ η(k Dfak + k Dgbk + 1) k sk , which proves that Dgb ◦ Dfa is the derivative of g ◦ f
at a. Since Dfa and Dgb are continuous, so is Dgb ◦ Dfa, which proves our proposition.
Theorem 39.6 has many interesting consequences. We mention two corollaries.
Proposition 39.7. Given three normed affine spaces E, F, and G, for any open subset A in
E, for any a ∈ A, let f : A → F such that Df(a) exists, and let g : F → G be a continuous
affine map. Then, D(g ◦ f)(a) exists, and
D(g ◦ f)(a) = −→g ◦ Df(a),
where −→g is the linear map associated with the affine map g.
Proposition 39.8. Given two normed affine spaces E and F, let A be some open subset in
E, let B be some open subset in F, let f : A → B be a bijection from A to B, and assume
that Df exists on A and that Df
−1
exists on B. Then, for every a ∈ A,
Df
−1
(f(a)) = (Df(a))−1
.
Proposition 39.8 has the remarkable consequence that the two vector spaces −→E and −→F
have the same dimension. In other words, a local property, the existence of a bijection f
between an open set A of E and an open set B of F, such that f is differentiable on A and
f
−1
is differentiable on B, implies a global property, that the two vector spaces −→E and −→F
have the same dimension.
Let us mention two more rules about derivatives that are used all the time.
Let ι: GL(n, C) → Mn(C) be the function (inversion) defined on invertible n×n matrices
by
ι(A) = A
−1
.
39.2. PROPERTIES OF DERIVATIVES 1419
Observe that GL(n, C) is indeed an open subset of the normed vector space Mn(C) of
complex n × n matrices, since its complement is the closed set of matrices A ∈ Mn(C)
satisfying det(A) = 0. Then we have
dιA(H) = −A
−1HA−1
,
for all A ∈ GL(n, C) and for all H ∈ Mn(C).
To prove the preceding line observe that for H with sufficiently small norm, we have
ι(A + H) − ι(A) + A
−1HA−1 = (A + H)
−1 − A
−1 + A
−1HA−1
= (A + H)

[I − (A + H)A

]
= (A + H)
−1
[I − I − HA−1 + HA−1 + HA−1HA−1
]
= (A + H)
−1HA−1HA−1
.
Consequently, we get

it is clear that limH7→0  (H) = 0, which proves that
dιA(H) = −A
−1HA−1
.
In particular, if A = I, then dιI (H) = −H.
Next, if f : Mn(C) → Mn(C) and g : Mn(C) → Mn(C) are differentiable matrix functions,
then
d(fg)A(B) = dfA(B)g(A) + f(A)dgA(B),
for all A, B ∈ Mn(C). This is known as the product rule.
When E is of finite dimension n, for any frame (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) of E, where (u1, . . . , un)
is a basis of −→E , we can define the directional derivatives with respect to the vectors in the
basis (u1, . . . , un) (actually, we can also do it for an infinite frame). This way, we obtain the
definition of partial derivatives, as follows.
Definition 39.4. For any two normed affine spaces E and F, if E is of finite dimension
n, for every frame (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) for E, for every a ∈ E, for every function f : E → F,
the directional derivatives Duj
f(a) (if they exist) are called the partial derivatives of f with
respect to the frame (a0,(u1, . . . , un)). The partial derivative Duj
f(a) is also denoted by
∂jf(a), or ∂f
∂xj
(a).
1420 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
The notation ∂f
∂xj
(a) for a partial derivative, although customary and going back to
Leibniz, is a “logical obscenity.” Indeed, the variable xj really has nothing to do with the
formal definition. This is just another of these situations where tradition is just too hard to
overthrow!
We now consider the situation where the normed affine space F is a finite direct sum
F = (F1, b1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (Fm, bm).
Proposition 39.9. Given normed affine spaces E and F = (F1, b1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (Fm, bm), given
any open subset A of E, for any a ∈ A, for any function f : A → F, letting f = (f1, . . . , fm),
Df(a) exists iff every Dfi(a) exists, and
Df(a) = in1 ◦ Df1(a) + · · · + inm ◦ Dfm(a).
Proof. Observe that f(a + h) − f(a) = (f(a + h) − b) − (f(a) − b), where b = (b1, . . . , bm),
and thus, as far as dealing with derivatives, Df(a) is equal to Dfb(a), where fb : E →
−→F is
defined such that fb(x) = f(x)−b, for every x ∈ E. Thus, we can work with the vector space
−→F instead of the affine space F. The proposition is then a simple application of Theorem
39.6.
In the special case where F is a normed affine space of finite dimension m, for any frame
(b0,(v1, . . . , vm)) of F, where (v1, . . . , vm) is a basis of −→F , every point x ∈ F can be expressed
uniquely as
x = b0 + x1v1 + · · · + xmvm,
where (x1, . . . , xm) ∈ Km, the coordinates of x in the frame (b0,(v1, . . . , vm)) (where K = R
or K = C). Thus, letting Fi be the standard normed affine space K with its natural
structure, we note that F is isomorphic to the direct sum F = (K, 0) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (K, 0). Then,
every function f : E → F is represented by m functions (f1, . . . , fm), where fi
: E → K
(where K = R or K = C), and
f(x) = b0 + f1(x)v1 + · · · + fm(x)vm,
for every x ∈ E. The following proposition is an immediate corollary of Proposition 39.9.
Proposition 39.10. For any two normed affine spaces E and F, if F is of finite dimension
m, for any frame (b0,(v1, . . . , vm)) of F, where (v1, . . . , vm) is a basis of −→F , for every a ∈ E,
a function f : E → F is differentiable at a iff each fi is differentiable at a, and
Df(a)(u) = Df1(a)(u)v1 + · · · + Dfm(a)(u)vm,
for every u ∈
−→E .
39.3. JACOBIAN MATRICES 1421
We now consider the situation where E is a finite direct sum. Given a normed affine
space E = (E1, a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (En, an) and a normed affine space F, given any open subset A
of E, for any c = (c1, . . . , cn) ∈ A, we define the continuous functions i
c
j
: Ej → E, such that
i
c
j
(x) = (c1, . . . , cj−1, x, cj+1, . . . , cn).
For any function f : A → F, we have functions f ◦ i
c
j
: Ej → F, defined on (i
c
j
)
−1
(A), which
contains cj
. If D(f ◦i
c
j
)(cj ) exists, we call it the partial derivative of f w.r.t. its jth argument,
at c. We also denote this derivative by Djf(c). Note that Djf(c) ∈ L(
−→Ej
;
−→F ).
This notion is a generalization of the notion defined in Definition 39.4. In fact, when
E is of dimension n, and a frame (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) has been chosen, we can write E =
(E1, a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (En, an), for some obvious (Ej
, aj ) (as explained just after Proposition 39.9),
and then
Djf(c)(λuj ) = λ∂jf(c),
and the two notions are consistent.
The definition of i
c
j
and of Djf(c) also makes sense for a finite product E1 × · · · × En of
affine spaces Ei
. We will use freely the notation ∂jf(c) instead of Djf(c).
The notion ∂jf(c) introduced in Definition 39.4 is really that of the vector derivative,
whereas Djf(c) is the corresponding linear map. Although perhaps confusing, we identify
the two notions. The following proposition holds.
Proposition 39.11. Given a normed affine space E = (E1, a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (En, an), and a
normed affine space F, given any open subset A of E, for any function f : A → F, for every
c ∈ A, if Df(c) exists, then each Djf(c) exists, and
Df(c)(u1, . . . , un) = D1f(c)(u1) + · · · + Dnf(c)(un),
for every ui ∈ Ei, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The same result holds for the finite product E1 × · · · × En.
Proof. Since every c ∈ E can be written as c = a + c − a, where a = (a1, . . . , an), defining
fa :
−→E → F such that, fa(u) = f(a + u), for every u ∈
−→E , clearly, Df(c) = Dfa(c − a), and
thus, we can work with the function fa whose domain is the vector space −→E . The proposition
is then a simple application of Theorem 39.6.
39.3 Jacobian Matrices
If both E and F are of finite dimension, for any frame (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) of E and any frame
(b0,(v1, . . . , vm)) of F, every function f : E → F is determined by m functions fi
: E → R
(or fi
: E → C), where
f(x) = b0 + f1(x)v1 + · · · + fm(x)vm,
1422 CHAPTER 39. DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS
for every x ∈ E. From Proposition 39.1, we have
Df(a)(uj ) = Duj
f(a) = ∂jf(a),
and from Proposition 39.10, we have
Df(a)(uj ) = Df1(a)(uj )v1 + · · · + Dfi(a)(uj )vi + · · · + Dfm(a)(uj )vm,
that is,
Df(a)(uj ) = ∂jf1(a)v1 + · · · + ∂jfi(a)vi + · · · + ∂jfm(a)vm.
Since the j-th column of the m×n-matrix representing Df(a) w.r.t. the bases (u1, . . . , un)
and (v1, . . . , vm) is equal to the components of the vector Df(a)(uj ) over the basis (v1, . . . ,vm),
the linear map Df(a) is determined by the m × n-matrix J(f)(a) = (∂jfi(a)), (or J(f)(a) =
