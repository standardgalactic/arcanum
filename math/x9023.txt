We now consider the problem of finding the minimum of a convex functional J : V → R
over a nonempty, convex, closed subset U of a Hilbert space V . By Theorem 40.13(3), the
functional J has a minimum at u ∈ U iff
dJu(v − u) ≥ 0 for all v ∈ U,
which can be expressed as
h∇Ju, v − ui ≥ 0 for all v ∈ U.
On the other hand, by the projection lemma (Proposition 48.5), the condition for a vector
u ∈ U to be the projection of an element w ∈ V onto U is
h
u − w, v − ui ≥ 0 for all v ∈ U.
49.11. GRADIENT PROJECTION FOR CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION 1717
These conditions are obviously analogous, and we can make this analogy more precise as
follows. If pU : V → U is the projection map onto U, we have the following chain of equiva￾lences:
u ∈ U and J(u) = inf
v∈U
J(v) iff
u ∈ U and h∇Ju, v − ui ≥ 0 for every v ∈ U, iff
u ∈ U and h u − (u − ρ∇Ju), v − ui ≥ 0 for every v ∈ U and every ρ > 0, iff
u = pU (u − ρ∇Ju) for every ρ > 0.
In other words, for every ρ > 0, u ∈ V is a fixed-point of the function g : V → U given by
g(v) = pU (v − ρ∇Jv).
The above suggests finding u by the method of successive approximations for finding the
fixed-point of a contracting mapping, namely given any initial u0 ∈ V , to define the sequence
(uk)k≥0 such that
uk+1 = pU (uk − ρk∇Juk
),
where the parameter ρk > 0 is chosen at each step. This method is called the projected￾gradient method with variable stepsize parameter . Observe that if U = V , then this is just the
gradient method with variable stepsize. We have the following result about the convergence
of this method.
Proposition 49.18. Let J : V → R be a continuously differentiable functional defined on
a Hilbert space V , and let U be nonempty, convex, closed subset of V . Suppose there exists
two constants α > 0 and M > 0 such that
h∇Jv − ∇Ju, v − ui ≥ α k v − uk
2
for all u, v ∈ V ,
and
k∇Jv − ∇Juk ≤ M k v − uk for all u, v ∈ V .
If there exists two real nunbers a, b ∈ R such that
0 < a ≤ ρk ≤ b ≤
2α
M2
for all k ≥ 0,
then the projected-gradient method with variable stepsize parameter converges. Furthermore,
there is some constant β > 0 (depending on α, M, a, b) such that
β < 1 and k uk − uk ≤ β
k
k u0 − uk ,
where u ∈ M is the unique minimum of J.
1718 CHAPTER 49. GENERAL RESULTS OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY
Proof. For every ρk ≥ 0, define the function gk : V → U by
gk(v) = pU (v − ρk∇Jv).
By Proposition 48.6, the projection map pU has Lipschitz constant 1, so using the inequalities
assumed to hold in the proposition, we have
k
gk(v1) − gk(v2)k
2 = k pU (v1 − ρk∇Jv1
) − pU (v2 − ρk∇Jv2
)k

As in the proof of Proposition 49.14, we know that if a and b satisfy the conditions 0 < a ≤

Since the minimizing point u ∈ U is a fixed point of gk for all k, by letting v1 = uk and
v2 = u, we get
k
uk+1 − uk = k gk(uk) − gk(u)k ≤ β k uk − uk ,
which proves the convergence of the sequence (uk)k≥0.
In the case of an elliptic quadratic functional
J(v) = 1
2
h
Av, ai − hb, vi
defined on R

adapted to show that convergence takes place as long as a, b and ρk are chosen such that
0 < a ≤ ρk ≤ b ≤

.
In theory, Proposition 49.18 gives a guarantee of the convergence of the projected-gradient
method. Unfortunately, because computing the projection pU (v) effectively is generally
impossible, the range of practical applications of Proposition 49.18 is rather limited. One
exception is the case where U is a product Q m
i=1[ai

or bi = +∞ is possible). In this case, it is not hard to show that
pU (w)i =

and if
J(v) = 1

49.12 Penalty Methods for Constrained Optimization
In the case where V = R
n
, another method to deal with constrained optimization is to
incorporate the domain U into the objective function J by adding a penalty function.
Definition 49.11. Given a nonempty closed convex subset U of R
n
, a function ψ: R
n → R
is called a penalty function for U if ψ is convex and continuous and if the following conditions
hold:
ψ(v) ≥ 0 for all v ∈ R
n
, and ψ(v) = 0 iff v ∈ U.
The following proposition shows that the use of penalty functions reduces a constrained
optimization problem to a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems.
Proposition 49.19. Let J : R
n → R be a continuous, coercive, strictly convex function, U
be a nonempty, convex, closed subset of R
n
, ψ: R
n → R be a penalty function for U, and let
J : R
n → R be the penalized objective function given by
J (v) = J(v) + 1

ψ(v) for all v ∈ R
n
.
Then for every  > 0, there exists a unique element u ∈ R
n
such that
J (u ) = inf
v∈Rn
J (v).
Furthermore, if u ∈ U is the unique minimizer of J over U, so that J(u) = infv∈U J(v), then
lim7→0
u = u.
Proof. Observe that since J is coercive, since ψ(v) ≥ 0 for all v ∈ R
n
, and J = J + (1/)ψ,
we have J (v) ≥ J(v) for all v ∈ R
n
, so J is also coercive. Since J is strictly convex and
(1/)ψ is convex, it is immediately checked that J = J + (1/)ψ is also strictly convex.
Then by Proposition 49.1 (and the fact that J and J are strictly convex), J has a unique
minimizer u ∈ U, and J has a unique minimizer u ∈ R
n
.
1720 CHAPTER 49. GENERAL RESULTS OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY
Since ψ(u) = 0 iff u ∈ U, and ψ(v) ≥ 0 for all v ∈ R
n
, we have J (u) = J(u), and since
u is the minimizer of J we have J (u ) ≤ J (u), so we obtain
J(u ) ≤ J(u ) + 1

ψ(u ) = J (u ) ≤ J (u) = J(u),
that is,
J (u ) ≤ J(u). (∗1)
Since J is coercive, the family (u )>0 is bounded. By compactness (since we are in R
n
),
there exists a subsequence (u (i))i≥0 with limi7→∞  (i) = 0 and some element u
0 ∈ R
n
such
that
lim
i7→∞
u (i) = u
0 .
From the inequality J(u ) ≤ J(u) proven in (∗1) and the continuity of J, we deduce that
J(u
0 ) = limi7→∞
J(u (i)) ≤ J(u). (∗2)
By definition of J (u ) and (∗1), we have
0 ≤ ψ(u (i)) ≤  (i)(J(u) − J(u (i))),
and since the sequence (u (i))i≥0 converges, the numbers J(u) − J(u (i)) are bounded inde￾pendently of i. Consequently, since limi7→∞  (i) = 0 and since the function ψ is continuous,
we have
0 = lim
i7→∞
ψ(u (i)) = ψ(u
0 ),
which shows that u
0 ∈ U. Since by (∗2) we have J(u
0 ) ≤ J(u), and since both u, u0 ∈ U
and u is the unique minimizer of J over U we must have u
0 = u. Therfore u
0 is the unique
minimizer of J over U. But then the whole family (u )>0 converges to u since we can use
the same argument as above for every subsequence of (u )>0.
Note that a convex function ψ: R
n → R is automatically continuous, so the assumption
of continuity is redundant.
As an application of Proposition 49.19, if U is given by
U = {v ∈ R
n
| ϕi(v) ≤ 0, i = 1, . . . , m},
where the functions ϕi
: R
n → R are convex, we can take ψ to be the function given by
ψ(v) =
mX
i=1
max{ϕi(v), 0}.
49.13. SUMMARY 1721
In practice, the applicability of the penalty-function method is limited by the difficulty
to construct effectively “good” functions ψ, for example, differentiable ones. Note that in
the above example the function ψ is not diferentiable. A better penalty function is
ψ(v) =
mX
i=1
(max{ϕi(v), 0})
2
.
Another way to deal with constrained optimization problems is to use duality. This
approach is investigated in Chapter 50.

Introduction to Nonlinear
Optimization
This chapter contains the most important results of nonlinear optimization theory.
In Chapter 40 we investigated the problem of determining when a function J : Ω → R
defined on some open subset Ω of a normed vector space E has a local extremum in a subset
U of Ω defined by equational constraints, namely
U = {x ∈ Ω | ϕi(x) = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ m},
where the functions ϕi
: Ω → R are continuous (and usually differentiable). Theorem 40.2
gave a necessary condition in terms of the Lagrange multipliers. In Section 40.3 we assumed
that U was a convex subset of Ω; then Theorem 40.9 gave us a necessary condition for the
function J : Ω → R to have a local minimum at u with respect to U if dJu exists, namely
dJu(v − u) ≥ 0 for all v ∈ U.
Our first goal is to find a necessary criterion for a function J : Ω → R to have a minimum
on a subset U, even is this subset is not convex. This can be done by introducing a notion
of “tangent cone” at a point u ∈ U. We define the cone of feasible directions and then
state a necessary condition for a function to have local minimum on a set U that is not
necessarily convex in terms of the cone of feasible directions. The cone of feasible directions
is not always convex, but it is if the constraints are inequality constraints. An inequality
constraint ϕ(u) ≤ 0 is said to be active if ϕ(u) = 0. One can also define the notion of
qualified constraint. Theorem 50.5 gives necessary conditions for a function J to have a
minimum on a subset U defined by qualified inequality constraints in terms of the Karush–
Kuhn–Tucker conditions (for short KKT conditions), which involve nonnegative Lagrange
multipliers. The proof relies on a version of the Farkas–Minkowski lemma. Some of the KTT
conditions assert that λiϕi(u) = 0, where λi ≥ 0 is the Lagrange multiplier associated with
the constraint ϕi ≤ 0. To some extent, this implies that active constaints are more important
than inactive constraints, since if ϕi(u) < 0 is an inactive constraint, then λi = 0. In general,
1727
1728 CHAPTER 50. INTRODUCTION TO NONLINEAR OPTIMIZATION
the KKT conditions are useless unlesss the constraints are convex. In this case, there is a
manageable notion of qualified constraint given by Slater’s conditions. Theorem 50.6 gives
necessary conditions for a function J to have a minimum on a subset U defined by convex
inequality constraints in terms of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. Furthermore, if J is
also convex and if the KKT conditions hold, then J has a global minimum.
In Section 50.4, we apply Theorem 50.6 to the special case where the constraints are
equality constraints, which can be expressed as Ax = b. In the special case where the convex
objective function J is a convex quadratic functional of the form
J(x) = 1
2
x
> P x + q
> x + r,
where P is a n × n symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, the necessary and sufficient
conditions for having a minimum are expressed by a linear system involving a matrix called
the KKT matrix. We discuss conditions that guarantee that the KKT matrix is invertible,
and how to solve the KKT system. We also briefly discuss variants of Newton’s method
dealing with equality constraints.
We illustrate the KKT conditions on an interesting example, the so-called hard margin
support vector machine; see Sections 50.5 and 50.6. The problem is a classification problem,
or more accurately a separation problem. Suppose we have two nonempty disjoint finite sets
of p blue points {ui}
p
i=1 and q red points {vj}
q
j=1 in R
n
. Our goal is to find a hyperplane H
of equation w
> x − b = 0 (where w ∈ R
n
is a nonzero vector and b ∈ R), such that all the
blue points ui are in one of the two open half-spaces determined by H, and all the red points
vj are in the other open half-space determined by H.
If the two sets are indeed separable, then in general there are infinitely many hyperplanes
separating them. Vapnik had the idea to find a hyperplane that maximizes the smallest
distance between the points and the hyperplane. Such a hyperplane is indeed unique and
is called a maximal hard margin hyperplane, or hard margin support vector machine. The
support vectors are those for which the constraints are active.
Section 50.7 contains the most important results of the chapter. The notion of Lagrangian
duality is presented. Given a primal optimization problem (P) consisting in minimizing an
objective function J(v) with respect to some inequality constraints ϕi(v) ≤ 0, i = 1, . . . , m,
we define the dual function G(µ) as the result of minimizing the Lagrangian
L(v, µ) = J(v) +
mX
i=1
µiϕi(v)
with respect to v, with µ ∈ R
m
+ . The dual program (D) is then to maximize G(µ) with
respect to µ ∈ R
m
+ . It turns out that G is a concave function, and the dual program is an
unconstrained maximization. This is actually a misleading statement because G is generally
a partial function, so maximizing G(µ) is equivalent to a constrained maximization problem
in which the constraints specify the domain of G, but in many cases, we obtain a dual

program simpler than the primal program. If d
∗
is the optimal value of the dual program
and if p
∗
is the optimal value of the primal program, we always have
d
∗ ≤ p

,
which is known as weak duality. Under certain conditions, d
∗ = p
∗
, that is, the duality gap
is zero, in which case we say that strong duality holds. Also, under certain conditions, a
solution of the dual yields a solution of the primal, and if the primal has an optimal solution,
then the dual has an optimal solution, but beware that the converse is generally false (see
Theorem 50.17). We also show how to deal with equality constraints, and discuss the use of
conjugate functions to find the dual function. Our coverage of Lagrangian duality is quite
thorough, but we do not discuss more general orderings such as the semidefinite ordering.
For these topics which belong to convex optimization, the reader is referred to Boyd and
Vandenberghe [29].
Our approach in this chapter is very much inspired by Ciarlet [41] because we find it
one of the more direct, and it is general enough to accomodate Hilbert spaces. The field
of nonlinear optimization and convex optimization is vast and there are many books on the
subject. Among those we recommend (in alphabetic order) Bertsekas [16, 17, 18], Bertsekas,
Nedi´c, and Ozdaglar [19], Boyd and Vandenberghe [29], Luenberger [116], and Luenberger
and Ye [117].
50.1 The Cone of Feasible Directions
Let V be a normed vector space and let U be a nonempty subset of V . For any point u ∈ U,
consider any converging sequence (uk)k≥0 of vectors uk ∈ U having u as their limit, with
uk 6 = u for all k ≥ 0, and look at the sequence of “unit chords,”
uk − u
k
uk − uk
.
This sequence could oscillate forever, or it could have a limit, some unit vector wb ∈ V . In
the second case, all nonzero vectors λwb for all λ > 0, belong to an object called the cone of
feasible directions at u. First, we need to define the notion of cone.
Definition 50.1. Given a (real) vector space V , a nonempty subset C ⊆ V is a cone with
apex 0 (for short, a cone), if for any v ∈ V , if v ∈ C, then λv ∈ C for all λ > 0 (λ ∈ R). For
any u ∈ V , a cone with apex u is any nonempty subset of the form u + C = {u + v | v ∈ C},
where C is a cone with apex 0; see Figure 50.1.
Observe that a cone with apex 0 (or u) is not necessarily convex, and that 0 does not
necessarily belong to C (resp. u does not necessarily belong to u + C) (although in the case
of the cone of feasible directions C(u) we have 0 ∈ C(u)). The condition for being a cone
only asserts that if a nonzero vector v belongs to C, then the open ray {λv | λ > 0} (resp.
the affine open ray u + {λv | λ > 0}) also belongs to C.

Figure 50.1: Let C be the cone determined by the bold orange curve through (0, 0, 1) in the
plane z = 1. Then u+C, where u = (0.25, 0.5, 0.5), is the affine translate of C via the vector
u.
Definition 50.2. Let V be a normed vector space and let U be a nonempty subset of V .
For any point u ∈ U, the cone C(u) of feasible directions at u is the union of {0} and the
set of all nonzero vectors w ∈ V for which there exists some convergent sequence (uk)k≥0 of
vectors such that
(1) uk ∈ U and uk 6 = u for all k ≥ 0, and limk7→∞ uk = u.

Condition (2) can also be expressed as follows: there is a sequence (δk)k≥0 of vectors δk ∈ V
such that
uk = u + k uk − uk

+ k uk − uk δk, lim
k7→∞
δk = 0, w 6 = 0.
Figure 50.2 illustrates the construction of w in C(u).
Clearly, the cone C(u) of feasible directions at u is a cone with apex 0, and u + C(u) is a
cone with apex u. Obviously, it would be desirable to have conditions on U that imply that
C(u) is a convex cone. Such conditions will be given later on.
Observe that the cone C(u) of feasible directions at u contains the velocity vectors at u of
all curves γ in U through u. If γ : (−1, 1) → U is such a curve with γ(0) = u, and if γ
0 (u) 6 = 0
