Observe that for every matrix A ∈ su(2), we have A∗ = −A, that is, A is skew Hermitian,

590 CHAPTER 16. UNIT QUATERNIONS AND ROTATIONS IN SO(3)
One needs to verify that the map Adq is an invertible linear map from su(2) to itself, and
that Ad is a group homomorphism, which is easy to do.
In order to associate a rotation ρq (in SO(3)) to q, we need to embed R
3
into H as the
pure quaternions, by
ψ(x, y, z) = 
−y

Then q defines the map ρq (on R
3
) given by
ρq(x, y, z) = ψ
−1
(qψ(x, y, z)q
∗
).
Therefore, modulo the isomorphism ψ, the linear map ρq is the linear isomorphism Adq.
In fact, it turns out that ρq is a rotation (and so is Adq), which we will prove shortly. So, the
representation of rotations in SO(3) by unit quaternions is just the adjoint representation
of SU(2); its image is a subgroup of GL(su(2)) isomorphic to SO(3).
Technically, it is a bit simpler to embed R

in the (real) vector spaces of Hermitian
matrices with zero trace,

Since the matrix ψ(x, y, z) is skew-Hermitian, the matrix −iψ(x, y, z) is Hermitian, and
we have

Matrices of the form xσ3 + yσ2 + zσ1 are Hermitian matrices with zero trace.
It is easy to see that every 2 × 2 Hermitian matrix with zero trace must be of this form.
(observe that (iσ1, iσ2, iσ3) forms a basis of su(2). Also, i = iσ3, j = iσ2, k = iσ1.)
Now, if A = xσ3 + yσ2 + zσ1 is a Hermitian 2 × 2 matrix with zero trace, we have
(qAq∗
)
∗ = qA∗
q
∗ = qAq∗
,
so qAq∗
is also Hermitian, and
tr(qAq∗
) = tr(Aq∗
q) = tr(A),
and qAq∗ also has zero trace. Therefore, the map A 7→ qAq∗ preserves the Hermitian matrices
with zero trace. We also have

We can embed R

into the space of Hermitian matrices with zero trace by
ϕ(x, y, z) = xσ3 + yσ2 + zσ1.

Definition 16.5. The unit quaternion q ∈ SU(2) induces a map rq on R

(q(xσ3 + yσ2 + zσ1)q

).
The map rq is clearly linear since ϕ is linear.
Proposition 16.1. For every unit quaternion q ∈ SU(2), the linear map rq is orthogonal,
that is, rq ∈ O(3).
Proof. Since

2 = −(x

we have

,
and we deduce that rq is an isometry. Thus, rq ∈ O(3).
In fact, rq is a rotation, and we can show this by finding the fixed points of rq. Let q be
a unit quaternion of the form
q =

−
α β
β α

with α = a + ib, β = c + id, and a
2 + b
2 + c
2 + d
2 = 1 (a, b, c, d ∈ R).
If b = c = d = 0, then q = I and rq is the identity so we may assume that (b, c, d) 6 =
(0, 0, 0).
Proposition 16.2. If (b, c, d) 6 = (0, 0, 0), then the fixed points of rq are solutions (x, y, z) of
the linear system
−dy + cz = 0
cx − by = 0
dx − bz = 0.
This linear system has the nontrivial solution (b, c, d) and has rank 2. Therefore, rq has the
eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity 1, and rq is a rotation whose axis is determined by (b, c, d).
592 CHAPTER 16. UNIT QUATERNIONS AND ROTATIONS IN SO(3)
Proof. We have rq(x, y, z) = (x, y, z) iff
ϕ

(q(xσ3 + yσ2 + zσ1)q

) = (x, y, z)
iff
q(xσ3 + yσ2 + zσ1)q

and since
ϕ(x, y, z) = xσ3 + yσ2 + zσ1 = A
with
A =

we see that rq(x, y, z) = (x, y, z) iff
qAq∗ = A iff qA = Aq.
We have

By equating qA and Aq, we get
i(β − β)y + (β + β)z = 0
2βx + i(α − α)y + (α − α)z = 0
2βx + i(α − α)y + (α − α)z = 0
i(β − β)y + (β + β)z = 0.
The first and the fourth equation are identical and the third equation is obtained by conju￾gating the second, so the above system reduces to
i(β − β)y + (β + β)z = 0
2βx + i(α − α)y + (α − α)z = 0.
Replacing α by a + ib and β by c + id, we get
−dy + cz = 0
cx − by + i(dx − bz) = 0,
16.2. REPRESENTATION OF ROTATION IN SO(3) BY QUATERNIONS IN SU(2)593
which yields the equations
−dy + cz = 0
cx − by = 0
dx − bz = 0.
This linear system has the nontrivial solution (b, c, d) and the matrix of this system is


d
0
c

−
0
d c
b


 .
Since (b, c, d) 6 = (0, 0, 0), this matrix always has a 2 × 2 submatrix which is nonsingular, so
it has rank 2, and consequently its kernel is the one-dimensional space spanned by (b, c, d).
Therefore, rq has the eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity 1. If we had det(rq) = −1, then the
eigenvalues of rq would be either (−1, 1, 1) or (−1, eiθ, e−iθ) with θ 6 = k2π (with k ∈ Z),
contradicting the fact that 1 is an eigenvalue with multiplicity 1. Therefore, rq is a rotation;
in fact, its axis is determined by (b, c, d).
In summary, q 7→ rq is a map r from SU(2) to SO(3).
Theorem 16.3. The map r : SU(2) → SO(3) is a homomorphism whose kernel is {I, −I}.
Proof. This map is a homomorphism, because if q1, q2 ∈ SU(2), then
rq2
(rq1
(x, y, z)) = ϕ
−1
(q2ϕ(rq1
(x, y, z))q2

∗
)
= ϕ
−1
((q2q1)ϕ(x, y, z)(q2q1)
∗
)
= rq2q1
(x, y, z).
The computation that showed that if (b, c, d) 6 = (0, 0, 0), then rq has the eigenvalue 1 with
multiplicity 1 implies the following: if rq = I3, namely rq has the eigenvalue 1 with multi￾plicity 3, then (b, c, d) = (0, 0, 0). But then a = ±1, and so q = ±I2. Therefore, the kernel
of the homomorphism r : SU(2) → SO(3) is {I, −I}.
Remark: Perhaps the quickest way to show that r maps SU(2) into SO(3) is to observe
that the map r is continuous. Then, since it is known that SU(2) is connected, its image by
r lies in the connected component of I, namely SO(3).
Proposition 16.2 showed that if u = (b, c, d) 6 = (0, 0, 0), then rq is a rotation whose axis
is determined by u = (b, c, d). The angle θ of this rotation can also be determined. The
following result is proven in Gallier [72] (Chapter 9).
594 CHAPTER 16. UNIT QUATERNIONS AND ROTATIONS IN SO(3)
Theorem 16.4. Let r : SU(2) → SO(3) be the homomorphism of Definition 16.5. For every
unit quaternion
q =

−

−

we have rq = I3 iff u = (b, c, d) = 0 iff |a| = 1. If u 6 = 0, then either a = 0 and rq is a
rotation by π around the axis of rotation determined by the vector u = (b, c, d), or 0 < |a| < 1
and rq is the rotation around the axis of rotation determined by the vector u = (b, c, d) and
the angle of rotation θ 6 = π with 0 < θ < 2π, is given by
tan(θ/2) = k uk
a
.
Here we are assuming that a basis (w1, w2) has been chosen in the plane orthogonal to
u = (b, c, d) such that (w1, w2, u) is positively oriented, that is, det(w1, w2, u) > 0 (where
w1, w2, u are expressed over the canonical basis (e1, e2, e3), which is chosen to define positive
orientation).
Remark: Under the orientation defined above, we have
cos(θ/2) = a, 0 < θ < 2π.
Note that the condition 0 < θ < 2π implies that θ is uniquely determined by the above
equation. This is not the case if we choose π such that −π < θ < π since both θ and −θ
satisfy the equation, and this shows why the condition 0 < θ < 2π is preferable. If 0 < a < 1,
then 0 < θ < π, and if −1 < a < 0, then π < θ < 2π. In the second case, rq is also the
rotation of axis −u and of angle −(2π − θ) = θ − 2π with 0 < 2π − θ < π, but this time the
orientation of the plane orthogonal to −u = (b, c, d) is the opposite orientation from before.
This orientation is given by (w2, w1), so that (w2, w1, −u) has positive orientation. Since the
quaternions q and −q define the same rotation, we may assume that a > 0, in which case
0 < θ < π, but we have to remember that if a < 0 and if we pick −q instead of q, the vector
defining the axis of rotation becomes −u, which amounts to flipping the orientation of the
plane orthogonal to the axis of rotation.
The map r is surjective, but this is not obvious. We will return to this point after finding
the matrix representing rq explicitly.

The above is the rotation matrix in Euler form induced by the quaternion q, which is the
matrix corresponding to ρq. This is because
ϕ = −iψ, ϕ−1 = iψ−1

so
rq(x, y, z) = ϕ

(qψ(x, y, z)q

and so rq = ρq.
We showed that every unit quaternion q ∈ SU(2) induces a rotation rq ∈ SO(3), but it
is not obvious that every rotation can be represented by a quaternion. This can shown in
various ways.
One way to is use the fact that every rotation in SO(3) is the composition of two reflec￾tions, and that every reflection σ of R
3
can be represented by a quaternion q, in the sense
that
σ(x, y, z) = −ϕ
−1
(qϕ(x, y, z)q

).
Note the presence of the negative sign. This is the method used in Gallier [72] (Chapter 9).
16.4 An Algorithm to Find a Quaternion Representing
a Rotation
Theorem 16.6. The homomorphism r : SU(2) → SO(3) is surjective.
Here is an algorithmic method to find a unit quaternion q representing a rotation matrix
R, which provides a proof of Theorem 16.6.

16.4. AN ALGORITHM TO FIND A QUATERNION REPRESENTING A ROTATION597
First observe that the trace of Rq is given by
tr(Rq) = 3a
2 − b
2 − c
2 − d
2
,
but since a
2 + b
2 + c
2 + d
2 = 1, we get tr(Rq) = 4a
2 − 1, so
a
2 =
tr(Rq) + 1
4
.
If R ∈ SO(3) is any rotation matrix and if we write
R =


r11 r12 r13
r21 r22 r23
r31 r32 r33,


we are looking for a unit quaternion q ∈ SU(2) such that Rq = R. Therefore, we must have
a
2 =
tr(R) + 1
4
.
We also know that
tr(R) = 1 + 2 cos θ,
where θ ∈ [0, π] is the angle of the rotation R, so we get
a
2 =
cos θ + 1
2
= cos2

2
θ

,
which implies that
|a| = cos 
2
θ

(0 ≤ θ ≤ π).
Note that we may assume that θ ∈ [0, π], because if π ≤ θ ≤ 2π, then θ − 2π ∈ [−π, 0], and
then the rotation of angle θ − 2π and axis determined by the vector (b, c, d) is the same as
the rotation of angle 2π − θ ∈ [0, π] and axis determined by the vector −(b, c, d). There are
two cases.
Case 1 . tr(R) 6 = −1, or equivalently θ 6 = π. In this case a 6 = 0. Pick
a =
p
tr(R) + 1
2
.
Then by equating R − R> and Rq − Rq
>
, we get
4ab = r32 − r23
4ac = r13 − r31
4ad = r21 − r12,
598 CHAPTER 16. UNIT QUATERNIONS AND ROTATIONS IN SO(3)
which yields
b =
r32 − r23
4a
, c =
r13 − r31
4a
, d =
r21 − r12
4a
.
Case 2 . tr(R) = −1, or equivalently θ = π. In this case a = 0. By equating R + R> and
Rq + Rq
>
, we get
4bc = r21 + r12
4bd = r13 + r31
4cd = r32 + r23.
By equating the diagonal terms of R and Rq, we also get
b
2 =
1 + r11
2
c
2 =
1 + r22
2
d
2 =
1 + r33
2
.
Since q 6 = 0 and a = 0, at least one of b, c, d is nonzero.
If b 6 = 0, let
b =

1 + r11
√
2

and determine c, d using
4bc = r21 + r12
4bd = r13 + r31.
If c 6 = 0, let
c =
√
1 + r22
√
2

and determine b, d using
4bc = r21 + r12
4cd = r32 + r23.
If d 6 = 0, let
d =
√
1 + r33
√
2

and determine b, c using

4cd = r32 + r23.
16.5. THE EXPONENTIAL MAP exp: su(2) → SU(2) 599
It is easy to check that whenever we computed a square root, if we had chosen a negative
sign instead of a positive sign, we would obtain the quaternion −q. However, both q and −q
determine the same rotation rq.
The above discussion involving the cases tr(R) 6 = −1 and tr(R) = −1 is reminiscent of
the procedure for finding a logarithm of a rotation matrix using the Rodrigues formula (see
Section 12.7). This is not surprising, because if
B =


0 −u3 u2
u3 0 −u1
−u2 u1 0


and if we write θ =
p u
2
1 + u
2
2 + u
2
3
(with 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π), then the Rodrigues formula says that
e
B = I +
sin θ
θ
B +
(1 − cos θ)
θ
2
B

, θ 6 = 0,
with e
0 = I. It is easy to check that tr(e
B) = 1 + 2 cos θ. Then it is an easy exercise to check
that the quaternion q corresponding to the rotation R = e
B (with B 6 = 0) is given by
q =

So the method for finding the logarithm of a rotation R is essentially the same as the method
for finding a quaternion defining R.
Remark: Geometrically, the group SU(2) is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere S
3
in R

,
S
3 = {(x, y, z, t) ∈ R
4
| x
2 + y
2 + z
2 + t
2 = 1}.
However, since the kernel of the surjective homomorphism r : SU(2) → SO(3) is {I, −I}, as
a topological space, SO(3) is homeomorphic to the quotient of S
3 obtained by identifying
antipodal points (x, y, z, t) and −(x, y, z, t). This quotient space is the (real) projective space
RP3
, and it is more complicated than S
3
. The space S
3
is simply-connected, but RP3
is not.
16.5 The Exponential Map exp: su(2) → SU(2)
Given any matrix A ∈ su(2), with
A =

iu1 u2 + iu3
−u2 + iu3 −iu1

,
it is easy to check that
A

 1 0
0 1 ,
with θ =
p u
2
1 + u

2 + u

. Then we have the following formula whose proof is very similar to
the proof of the formula given in Proposition 9.22.
600 CHAPTER 16. UNIT QUATERNIONS AND ROTATIONS IN SO(3)
Proposition 16.7. For every matrix A ∈ su(2), with
A =

iu1 u2 + iu3
−u2 + iu3 −iu1

,
if we write θ =
p u
2
1 + u
2
2 + u
2
3
, then
e
A = cos θI +
sin θ
θ
A, θ 6 = 0,
and e
0 = I.
Therefore, by the discussion at the end of the previous section, e
A is a unit quaternion
representing the rotation of angle 2θ and axis (u1, u2, u3) (or I when θ = kπ, k ∈ Z). The
above formula shows that we may assume that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π. Proposition 16.7 shows that
the exponential yields a map exp: su(2) → SU(2). It is an analog of the exponential map
exp: so(3) → SO(3).
Remark: Because so(3) and su(2) are real vector spaces of dimension 3, they are isomorphic,
and it is easy to construct an isomorphism. In fact, so(3) and su(2) are isomorphic as Lie
algebras, which means that there is a linear isomorphism preserving the the Lie bracket
[A, B] = AB − BA. However, as observed earlier, the groups SU(2) and SO(3) are not
isomorphic.
An equivalent, but often more convenient, formula is obtained by assuming that u =
(u1, u2, u3) is a unit vector, equivalently det(A) = 1, in which case A2 = −I, so we have
e
θA = cos θI + sin θA.
Using the quaternion notation, this is read as
