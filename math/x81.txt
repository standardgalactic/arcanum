are all distinct, so the above does hold. Since LI (uI ) = 1, we conclude that
uI 6 = 0. If we have a linear combination
X
I
λIuI = 0,
where the above sum is finite and involves nonempty finite subset I ⊆ Σ with |I| = n, for
every such I, when we apply LI we get λI = 0, proving linear independence.
As a corollary, if E is finite dimensional, say dim(E) = d, and if 1 ≤ n ≤ d, then we have
dim(
n^
(E)) =  n
d

,
and if n > d, then dim(V n
(E)) = 0.
Remark: When n = 0, if we set u∅ = 1, then (u∅) = (1) is a basis of V 0
(V ) = K.
It follows from Proposition 34.7 that the family (uI )I where I ⊆ Σ ranges over finite
subsets of Σ is a basis of V (V ) = L n≥0
V
n
(V ).
As a corollary of Proposition 34.7 we obtain the following useful criterion for linear
independence.
Proposition 34.8. For any vector space E, the vectors u1, . . . , un ∈ E are linearly indepen￾dent iff u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un 6 = 0.
Proof. If u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un 6 = 0, then u1, . . . , un must be linearly independent. Otherwise, some
ui would be a linear combination of the other uj
’s (with j 6 = i), and then, as in the proof of
Proposition 34.7, u1 ∧ · · · ∧un would be a linear combination of wedges in which two vectors
are identical, and thus zero.
Conversely, assume that u1, . . . , un are linearly independent. Then we have the linear
forms u
∗
i ∈ E
∗
such that
u
∗
i
(uj ) = δi,j 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n.
As in the proof of Proposition 34.7, we have a linear map Lu1,...,un
:
V
n
(E) → K given by
Lu1,...,un
(v1 ∧ · · · ∧ vn) = det(u

(E). As Lu1,...,un
(u1 ∧ · · · ∧un) = 1, we conclude that u1 ∧ · · · ∧un 6 =
0.
34.3. SOME USEFUL ISOMORPHISMS FOR EXTERIOR POWERS 1205
Proposition 34.8 shows that geometrically every nonzero wedge u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un corresponds
to some oriented version of an n-dimensional subspace of E.
34.3 Some Useful Isomorphisms for Exterior Powers
We can show the following property of the exterior tensor product, using the proof technique
of Proposition 33.13.
Proposition 34.9. We have the following isomorphism:
n^

V

(E) −→ K as follows: Consider the multilinear map

It is easily checked that this expression is alternating w.r.t. the ui

For any fixed (v1

with U =

(E

V

(E) and W = K, we can view L as a linear map
L:
n^

n^

which by Proposition 33.8 corresponds to a bilinear map
h−, −i:
n^

n^

This pairing is given explicitly in terms of generators by
h
v1

∗
, u1, . . . , uni = det(vj

Now this pairing in nondegenerate. This can be shown using bases. Given any basis
(e1, . . . , em) of E, for every basis element e

We leave the details as an exercise to the reader. As a consequence we get the following
canonical isomorphisms.
Proposition 34.10. There is a canonical isomorphism
(
n^
(E))∗ ∼=
n^
(E
∗
).
There is also a canonical isomorphism
µ:
n^
(E
∗
) ∼= Altn
(E; K)
which allows us to interpret alternating tensors over E
∗ as alternating multilinear maps.
34.4. DUALITY FOR EXTERIOR POWERS 1207
Proof. The second isomorphism follows from the canonical isomorphism (V n
(E))∗ ∼=
V
n
(E
∗
)
and the canonical isomorphism (V n
(E))∗ ∼= Altn
(E; K) given by Proposition 34.5.
Remarks:
1. The isomorphism µ:
V
n
(E
∗
) ∼= Altn
(E; K) discussed above can be described explicitly
as the linear extension of the map given by
µ(v1
∗ ∧ · · · ∧ vn
∗
)(u1, . . . , un) = det(vj
∗
(ui)).
2. The canonical isomorphism of Proposition 34.10 holds under more general conditions.
Namely, that K is a commutative ring with identity and that E is a finitely-generated
projective K-module (see Definition 35.7). See Bourbaki, [25] (Chapter III, §11, Section
5, Proposition 7).
3. Variants of our isomorphism µ are found in the literature. For example, there is a
version µ
0 , where
µ
0 =
1
n!
µ,
with the factor 1
n!
added in front of the determinant. Each version has its its own
merits and inconveniences. Morita [129] uses µ
0 because it is more convenient than µ
when dealing with characteristic classes. On the other hand, µ
0 may not be defined
for a field with positive characteristic, and when using µ
0 , some extra factor is needed
in defining the wedge operation of alternating multilinear forms (see Section 34.5) and
for exterior differentiation. The version µ is the one adopted by Warner [186], Knapp
[104], Fulton and Harris [68], and Cartan [34, 35].
If f : E → F is any linear map, by transposition we get a linear map f

∗ → E
∗ given
by
f

◦ f, v∗ ∈ F

Consequently, we have
f

(f(u)), for all u ∈ E and all v

For any p ≥ 1, the map

As in the case of symmetric powers, the map from E
n
to V n
(E) given by (u1, . . . , un) 7→
u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un yields a surjection π : E
⊗n →
V n
(E). Now this map has some section, so there
is some injection η :
V
n
(E) → E
⊗n with π ◦ η = id. As we saw in Proposition 34.10 there is
a canonical isomorphism
(
n^
(E))∗ ∼=
n^
(E
∗
)
for any field K, even of positive characteristic. However, if our field K has characteristic 0,
then there is a special section having a natural definition involving an antisymmetrization
process.
Recall, from Section 33.10 that we have a left action of the symmetric group Sn on E
⊗n
.
The tensors z ∈ E
⊗n
such that
σ · z = sgn(σ) z, for all σ ∈ Sn
are called antisymmetrized tensors. We define the map η : E
n → E
⊗n by
η(u1, . . . , un) =
n
1
!
X
σ∈Sn
sgn(σ) uσ(1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ uσ(n)
.

It is the division by n! that requires the field to have characteristic zero.

Clearly, V n
η(
V
n
(E)) is the set of antisymmetrized tensors in E
⊗n
. If we consider the map
A = (V n
η) ◦ π : E
⊗n −→ E
⊗n
, it is easy to check that A ◦ A = A. Therefore, A is a
projection, and by linear algebra, we know that
E
⊗n = A(E
⊗n
) ⊕ Ker A =
n^
η(
n^
(E)) ⊕ Ker A.
It turns out that Ker A = E
⊗n ∩ Ia = Ker π, where Ia is the two-sided ideal of T(E)
generated by all tensors of the form u ⊗ u ∈ E
⊗2
(for example, see Knapp [104], Appendix
A). Therefore, V n
η is injective,
E
⊗n =
n^
η(
n^
(E)) ⊕ (E
⊗n ∩ Ia) =
n^
η(
n^

and the exterior tensor power V n
(E) is naturally embedded into E
⊗n
.
34.5 Exterior Algebras
As in the case of symmetric tensors, we can pack together all the exterior powers V n
(V ) into
an algebra.
Definition 34.5. Gieven any vector space V , the vector space
^
(V ) = M
m≥0
m^
(V )
is called the exterior algebra (or Grassmann algebra) of V .
To make V (V ) into an algebra, we mimic the procedure used for symmetric powers. If
Ia is the two-sided ideal generated by all tensors of the form u ⊗ u ∈ V
⊗2
, we set
•^
(V ) = T(V )/Ia.
Then V •
(V ) automatically inherits a multiplication operation, called wedge product, and
since T(V ) is graded, that is
T(V ) = M
m≥0
V
⊗m,
1210 CHAPTER 34. EXTERIOR TENSOR POWERS AND EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS
we have
•^
(V ) = M
m≥0
V
⊗m/(Ia ∩ V
⊗m).
However, it is easy to check that
m^
(V ) ∼= V
⊗m/(Ia ∩ V
⊗m),
so
•
When V has finite dimension d, we actually have a finite direct sum (coproduct)
^
(V ) ∼=
^ (V ).
^
(V ) =
d
M
m=0
m^
(V ),
and since each V m
(V ) has dimension ￾ d
m

, we deduce that
dim(^ (V )) = 2d = 2dim(V )
.
The multiplication, ∧:
V
m
(V )×
V
n
(V ) →
V m+n
(V ), is skew-symmetric in the following
precise sense:
Proposition 34.12. For all α ∈
V
m
(V ) and all β ∈
V
n
(V ), we have
β ∧ α = (−1)mnα ∧ β.
Proof. Since v ∧ u = −u ∧ v for all u, v ∈ V , Proposition 34.12 follows by induction.
Since α ∧ α = 0 for every simple (also called decomposable) tensor α = u1 ∧ · · · ∧ un, it
seems natural to infer that α ∧ α = 0 for every tensor α ∈
V (V ). If we consider the case
where dim(V ) ≤ 3, we can indeed prove the above assertion. However, if dim(V ) ≥ 4, the
above fact is generally false! For example, when dim(V ) = 4, if (u1, u2, u3, u4) is a basis for
V , for α = u1 ∧ u2 + u3 ∧ u4, we check that
α ∧ α = 2u1 ∧ u2 ∧ u3 ∧ u4,
which is nonzero. However, if α ∈
V
m E with m odd, since m2
is also odd, we have
α ∧ α = (−1)m2
α ∧ α = −α ∧ α,
so indeed α ∧ α = 0 (if K is not a field of characteristic 2).
34.5. EXTERIOR ALGEBRAS 1211
The above discussion suggests that it might be useful to know when an alternating tensor
is simple (decomposable). We will show in Section 34.7 that for tensors α ∈
V
2
(V ), α∧α = 0
iff α is simple.
A general criterion for decomposability can be given in terms of some operations known
as left hook and right hook (also called interior products); see Section 34.7.
It is easy to see that V (V ) satisfies the following universal mapping property.
Proposition 34.13. Given any K-algebra A, for any linear map f : V → A, if (f(v))2 = 0
for all v ∈ V , then there is a unique K-algebra homomorphism f :
V (V ) → A so that
f = f ◦ i,
as in the diagram below.

(E; K),
(f ∧ g)(u1, . . . , um+n) = X

such that σ(1) < · · · < σ(m) and σ(m+1) < · · · < σ(m+n). For example, when m = n = 1,
we have
(f ∧ g)(u, v) = f(u)g(v) − g(u)f(v).
