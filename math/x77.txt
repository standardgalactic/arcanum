On the other hand, focusing on (T1, ϕ1), we have a multilinear map ϕ1 : E1 × · · · × En → T1,
but the unique linear map h: T1 → T1 with

is h = id, as illustrated by the following commutative diagram

and we must have

This shows that (ϕ1)⊗ and (ϕ2)⊗ are inverse linear maps, and thus, (ϕ2)⊗ : T1 → T2 is an
isomorphism between T1 and T2.
Now that we have shown that tensor products are unique up to isomorphism, we give a
construction that produces them. Tensor products are obtained from free vector spaces by
a quotient process, so let us begin by describing the construction of the free vector space
generated by a set.
For simplicity assume that our set I is finite, say
I = {♥, ♦, ♠, ♣}.
The construction works for any field K (and in fact for any commutative ring A, in which
case we obtain the free A-module generated by I). Assume that K = R. The free vector
space generated by I is the set of all formal linear combinations of the form
a♥ + b♦ + c♠ + d♣,
with a, b, c, d ∈ R. It is assumed that the order of the terms does not matter. For example,
2♥ − 5♦ + 3♠ = −5♦ + 2♥ + 3♠.
Addition and multiplication by a scalar are are defined as follows:
(a1♥ + b1♦ + c1♠ + d1♣) + (a2♥ + b2♦ + c2♠ + d2♣)
= (a1 + a2)♥ + (b1 + b2)♦ + (c1 + c2)♠ + (d1 + d2)♣,
and
α · (a♥ + b♦ + c♠ + d♣) = αa♥ + αb♦ + αc♠ + αd♣,
for all a, b, c, d, α ∈ R. With these operations, it is immediately verified that we obtain a
vector space denoted R
(I)
. The set I can be viewed as embedded in R
(I) by the injection ι
given by
ι(♥) = 1♥, ι(♦) = 1♦, ι(♠) = 1♠, ι(♣) = 1♣.
Thus, R
(I)
can be viewed as the vector space with the special basis I = {♥, ♦, ♠, ♣}. In our
case, R
(I)
is isomorophic to R
4
.
1154 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
The exact same construction works for any field K, and we obtain a vector space denoted
by K(I) and an injection ι: I → K(I)
.
The main reason why the free vector space K(I) over a set I is interesting is that it
satisfies a universal mapping property. This means that for every vector space F (over the
field K), any function h: I → F, where F is considered just a set, has a unique linear
extension h: K(I) → F. By extension, we mean that h(i) = h(i) for all i ∈ I, or more
rigorously that h = h ◦ ι.
For example, if I = {♥, ♦, ♠, ♣}, K = R, and F = R
3
, the function h given by
h(♥) = (1, 1, 1), h(♦) = (1, 1, 0), h(♠) = (1, 0, 0), h(♣) = (0, 0 − 1)
has a unique linear extension h: R
(I) → R
3
to the free vector space R
(I)
, given by
h(a♥ + b♦ + c♠ + d♣) = ah(♥) + bh(♦) + ch(♠) + dh(♣)
= ah(♥) + bh(♦) + ch(♠) + dh(♣)
= a(1, 1, 1) + b(1, 1, 0) + c(1, 0, 0) + d(0, 0, −1)
= (a + b + c, a + b, a − d).
To generalize the construction of a free vector space to infinite sets I, we observe that
the formal linear combination a♥ + b♦ + c♠ + d♣ can be viewed as the function f : I → R
given by
f(♥) = a, f(♦) = b, f(♠) = c, f(♣) = d,
where a, b, c, d ∈ R. More generally, we can replace R by any field K. If I is finite, then
the set of all such functions is a vector space under pointwise addition and pointwise scalar
multiplication. If I is infinite, since addition and scalar multiplication only makes sense for
finite vectors, we require that our functions f : I → K take the value 0 except for possibly
finitely many arguments. We can think of such functions as an infinite sequences (fi)i∈I of
elements fi of K indexed by I, with only finitely many nonzero fi
. The formalization of this
construction goes as follows.
Given any set I viewed as an index set, let K(I) be the set of all functions f : I → K
such that f(i) 6 = 0 only for finitely many i ∈ I. As usual, denote such a function by (fi)i∈I ;
it is a family of finite support. We make K(I)
into a vector space by defining addition and
scalar multiplication by
(fi) + (gi) = (fi + gi)
λ(fi) = (λfi).
The family (ei)i∈I is defined such that (ei)j = 0 if j 6 = i and (ei)i = 1. It is a basis of
the vector space K(I)
, so that every w ∈ K(I)
can be uniquely written as a finite linear
combination of the ei
. There is also an injection ι: I → K(I)
such that ι(i) = ei
for every
i ∈ I. Furthermore, it is easy to show that for any vector space F, and for any function

Definition 33.5. The vector space (K(I)
, ι) constructed as above from a set I is called the
free vector space generated by I (or over I). The commutativity of the above diagram is
called the universal mapping property of the free vector space (K(I)
, ι) over I.
Using the proof technique of Proposition 33.5, it is not hard to prove that any two vector
spaces satisfying the above universal mapping property are isomorphic.
We can now return to the construction of tensor products. For simplicity consider two
vector spaces E1 and E2. Whatever E1 ⊗ E2 and ϕ: E1 × E2 → E1 ⊗ E2 are, since ϕ is
supposed to be bilinear, we must have
ϕ(u1 + u2, v1) = ϕ(u1, v1) + ϕ(u2, v1)
ϕ(u1, v1 + v2) = ϕ(u1, v1) + ϕ(u1, v2)
ϕ(λu1, v1) = λϕ(u1, v1)
ϕ(u1, µv1) = µϕ(u1, v1)
for all u1, u2 ∈ E1, all v1, v2 ∈ E2, and all λ, µ ∈ K. Since E1 ⊗ E2 must satisfy the universal
mapping property of Definition 33.4, we may want to define E1 ⊗E2 as the free vector space
K(E1×E2) generated by I = E1 ×E2 and let ϕ be the injection of E1 ×E2 into K(E1×E2)
. The
problem is that in K(E1×E2)
, vectors such that
(u1 + u2, v1) and (u1, v1) + (u2, v2)
are different, when they should really be the same, since ϕ is bilinear. Since K(E1×E2)
is free,
there are no relations among the generators and this vector space is too big for our purpose.
The remedy is simple: take the quotient of the free vector space K(E1×E2) by the subspace
N generated by the vectors of the form
(u1 + u2, v1) − (u1, v1) − (u2, v1)
(u1, v1 + v2) − (u1, v1) − (u1, v2)
(λu1, v1) − λ(u1, v1)
(u1, µv1) − µ(u1, v1).
Then, if we let E1 ⊗ E2 be the quotient space K(E1×E2)/N and let ϕ be the quotient map,
this forces ϕ to be bilinear. Checking that (K(E1×E2)/N, ϕ) satisfies the universal mapping
property is straightforward. Here is the detailed construction.
1156 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
Theorem 33.6. Given n ≥ 2 vector spaces E1, . . . , En, a tensor product (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, ϕ)
for E1, . . . , En can be constructed. Furthermore, denoting ϕ(u1, . . . , un) as u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un, the
tensor product E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En is generated by the vectors u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un, where
u1 ∈ E1, . . . , un ∈ En, and for every multilinear map f : E1 × · · · × En → F, the unique
linear map f⊗ : E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En → F such that f = f⊗ ◦ ϕ is defined by
f⊗(u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un) = f(u1, . . . , un)
on the generators u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un of E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En.
Proof. First we apply the construction of a free vector space to the cartesian product I =
E1×· · ·×En, obtaining the free vector space M = K(I) on I = E1×· · ·×En. Since every basis
generator ei ∈ M is uniquely associated with some n-tuple i = (u1, . . . , un) ∈ E1 × · · · × En,
we denote ei by (u1, . . . , un).
Next let N be the subspace of M generated by the vectors of the following type:
(u1, . . . , ui + vi
, . . . , un) − (u1, . . . , ui
, . . . , un) − (u1, . . . , vi
, . . . , un),
(u1, . . . , λui
, . . . , un) − λ(u1, . . . , ui
, . . . , un).
We let E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En be the quotient M/N of the free vector space M by N, π : M → M/N
be the quotient map, and set
ϕ = π ◦ ι.
By construction, ϕ is multilinear, and since π is surjective and the ι(i) = ei generate M, the
fact that each i is of the form i = (u1, . . . , un) ∈ E1 × · · · × En implies that ϕ(u1, . . . , un)
generate M/N. Thus, if we denote ϕ(u1, . . . , un) as u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un, the space E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En
is generated by the vectors u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un, with ui ∈ Ei
.
It remains to show that (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, ϕ) satisfies the universal mapping property. To
this end, we begin by proving there is a map h such that f = h ◦ ϕ. Since M = K(E1×···×En)
is free on I = E1 × · · · × En, there is a unique linear map f : K(E1×···×En) → F, such that
f = f ◦ ι,

Because f is multilinear, note that we must have f(w) = 0 for every w ∈ N; for example,

, . . . , un) − (u1, . . . , vi
, . . . , un)
33.2. TENSORS PRODUCTS 1157
we have
f((u1, . . . , ui + vi
, . . . , un) − (u1, . . . , ui
, . . . , un) − (u1, . . . , vi
, . . . , un))
= f(u1, . . . , ui + vi
, . . . , un) − f(u1, . . . , ui

, . . . , un) − f(u1, . . . , ui
, . . . , un)
− f(u1, . . . , vi
, . . . , un)
= 0.
But then, f : M → F factors through M/N, which means that there is a unique linear map
h: M/N → F such that f = h ◦ π making the following diagram commute

by defining h([z]) = f(z) for every z ∈ M, where [z] denotes the equivalence class in M/N
of z ∈ M. Indeed, the fact that f vanishes on N insures that h is well defined on M/N, and
it is clearly linear by definition. Since f = f ◦ ι, from the equation f = h ◦ π, by composing
on the right with ι, we obtain
f = f ◦ ι = h ◦ π ◦ ι = h ◦ ϕ,

We now prove the uniqueness of h. For any linear map f⊗ : E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En → F such that
f = f⊗ ◦ ϕ, since the vectors u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un generate E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En and since ϕ(u1, . . . , un) =
u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un, the map f⊗ is uniquely defined by
f⊗(u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un) = f(u1, . . . , un).
Since f = h ◦ ϕ, the map h is unique, and we let f⊗ = h.
The map ϕ from E1 × · · · × En to E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En is often denoted by ι⊗, so that
ι⊗(u1, . . . , un) = u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un.
1158 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
What is important about Theorem 33.6 is not so much the construction itself but the
fact that it produces a tensor product with the universal mapping property with respect to
multilinear maps. Indeed, Theorem 33.6 yields a canonical isomorphism
L(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, F) ∼= L(E1, . . . , En; F)
between the vector space of linear maps L(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, F), and the vector space of multi￾linear maps L(E1, . . . , En; F), via the linear map − ◦ ϕ defined by
h 7→ h ◦ ϕ,
where h ∈ L(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, F). Indeed, h ◦ ϕ is clearly multilinear, and since by Theorem
33.6, for every multilinear map f ∈ L(E1, . . . , En; F), there is a unique linear map f⊗ ∈
L(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, F) such that f = f⊗ ◦ ϕ, the map − ◦ ϕ is bijective. As a matter of fact,
its inverse is the map
f 7→ f⊗.
We record this fact as the following proposition.
Proposition 33.7. Given a tensor product (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, ϕ), the linear map h 7→ h ◦ ϕ is
a canonical isomorphism
L(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, F) ∼= L(E1, . . . , En; F)
between the vector space of linear maps L(E1⊗· · ·⊗En, F), and the vector space of multilinear
maps L(E1, . . . , En; F).
Using the “Hom” notation, the above canonical isomorphism is written
Hom(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, F) ∼= Hom(E1, . . . , En; F).
Remarks:
(1) To be very precise, since the tensor product depends on the field K, we should subscript
the symbol ⊗ with K and write
E1 ⊗K · · · ⊗K En.
However, we often omit the subscript K unless confusion may arise.
(2) For F = K, the base field, Proposition 33.7 yields a canonical isomorphism be￾tween the vector space L(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, K), and the vector space of multilinear forms
L(E1, . . . , En; K). However, L(E1 ⊗· · ·⊗En, K) is the dual space (E1 ⊗· · ·⊗En)
∗
, and
thus the vector space of multilinear forms L(E1, . . . , En; K) is canonically isomorphic
to (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En)
∗
.
33.2. TENSORS PRODUCTS 1159
Since this isomorphism is used often, we record it as the following proposition.
Proposition 33.8. Given a tensor product E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗En,, there is a canonical isomorphism
L(E1, . . . , En; K) ∼= (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En)
∗
between the vector space of multilinear maps L(E1, . . . , En; K) and the dual (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En)
∗
of the tensor product E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En.
The fact that the map ϕ: E1 × · · · × En → E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En is multilinear, can also be
expressed as follows:
u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (vi + wi) ⊗ · · · ⊗ un = (u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vi ⊗ · · · ⊗ un) + (u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wi ⊗ · · · ⊗ un),
u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (λui) ⊗ · · · ⊗ un = λ(u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ui ⊗ · · · ⊗ un).
Of course, this is just what we wanted!
Definition 33.6. Tensors in E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En are called n-tensors, and tensors of the form
u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ un, where ui ∈ Ei are called simple (or decomposable) n-tensors. Those n-tensors
that are not simple are often called compound n-tensors.
Not only do tensor products act on spaces, but they also act on linear maps (they are
functors).
Proposition 33.9. Given two linear maps f : E → E
0 and g : F → F
0 , there is a unique
linear map
f ⊗ g : E ⊗ F → E
0 ⊗ F
0
such that
(f ⊗ g)(u ⊗ v) = f(u) ⊗ g(v),
for all u ∈ E and all v ∈ F.
Proof. We can define h: E × F → E
0 ⊗ F
0 by
h(u, v) = f(u) ⊗ g(v).
It is immediately verified that h is bilinear, and thus it induces a unique linear map

Definition 33.7. The linear map f ⊗ g : E ⊗ F → E
0 ⊗ F
0 given by Proposition 33.9 is
called the tensor product of f : E → E
0 and g : F → F
0 .
Another way to define f ⊗ g proceeds as follows. Given two linear maps f : E → E
0 and
g : F → F
0 , the map f × g is the linear map from E × F to E
0 × F
0 given by
(f × g)(u, v) = (f(u), g(v)), for all u ∈ E and all v ∈ F .
Then the map h in the proof of Proposition 33.9 is given by h = ι

the unique linear map making the following diagram commute.

Remark: The notation f ⊗g is potentially ambiguous, because Hom(E, F) and Hom(E

are vector spaces, so we can form the tensor product Hom(E, F)⊗Hom(E
0 , F0 ) which contains
elements also denoted f ⊗ g. To avoid confusion, the first kind of tensor product of linear
maps defined in Proposition 33.9 (which yields a linear map in Hom(E ⊗F, E0 ⊗F
0 )) can be
denoted by T(f, g). If we denote the tensor product E ⊗ F by T(E, F), this notation makes
it clearer that T is a bifunctor. If E, E0 and F, F0 are finite dimensional, by picking bases it
is not hard to show that the map induced by f ⊗ g 7→ T(f, g) is an isomorphism
Hom(E, F) ⊗ Hom(E

We showed that E1 ⊗· · ·⊗En is generated by the vectors of the form u1 ⊗· · ·⊗un. However,
these vectors are not linearly independent. This situation can be fixed when considering
bases.
To explain the idea of the proof, consider the case when we have two spaces E and F
both of dimension 3. Given a basis (e1, e2, e3) of E and a basis (f1, f2, f3) of F, we would
like to prove that
e1 ⊗ f1, e1 ⊗ f2, e1 ⊗ f3, e2 ⊗ f1, e2 ⊗ f2, e2 ⊗ f3, e3 ⊗ f1, e3 ⊗ f2, e3 ⊗ f3
are linearly independent. To prove this, it suffices to show that for any vector space G, if
w11, w12, w13, w21, w22, w23, w31, w32, w33 are any vectors in G, then there is a bilinear map
h: E × F → G such that
h(ei
, ej ) = wij , 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3.
Because h yields a unique linear map h⊗ : E ⊗ F → G such that
h⊗(ei ⊗ ej ) = wij , 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 3,
and by Proposition 33.4, the vectors
e1 ⊗ f1, e1 ⊗ f2, e1 ⊗ f3, e2 ⊗ f1, e2 ⊗ f2, e2 ⊗ f3, e3 ⊗ f1, e3 ⊗ f2, e3 ⊗ f3
are linearly independent. This suggests understanding how a bilinear function f : E×F → G
is expressed in terms of its values f(ei
, fj ) on the basis vectors (e1, e2, e3) and (f1, f2, f3),
and this can be done easily. Using bilinearity we obtain
f(u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3, v1f1 + v2f2 + v3f3) = u1v1f(e1, f1) + u1v2f(e1, f2) + u1v3f(e1, f3)
+ u2v1f(e2, f1) + u2v2f(e2, f2) + u2v3f(e2, f3)
+ u3v1f(e3, f1) + u3v2f(e3, f2) + u3v3f(e3, f3).
Therefore, given w11, w12, w13, w21, w22, w23, w31, w32, w33 ∈ G, the function h given by
h(u1e1 + u2e2 + u3e3, v1f1 + v2f2 + v3f3) = u1v1w11 + u1v2w12 + u1v3w13
+ u2v1w21 + u2v2w22 + u2v3w23
+ u3v1w31 + u3v2w33 + u3v3w33
is clearly bilinear, and by construction h(ei
, fj ) = wij , so it does the job.
The generalization of this argument to any number of vector spaces of any dimension
(even infinite) is straightforward.
Proposition 33.12. Given n ≥ 2 vector spaces E1, . . . , En, if (u
k
i
)i∈Ik
is a basis for Ek,
1 ≤ k ≤ n, then the family of vectors
(u
1
i1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ u
n
in
)(i1,...,in)∈I1×...×In
is a basis of the tensor product E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En.
33.4. SOME USEFUL ISOMORPHISMS FOR TENSOR PRODUCTS 1163
Proof. For each k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, every v
k ∈ Ek can be written uniquely as
v
k =
X
j∈Ik
vj
ku
k
j
,
for some family of scalars (vj
k
)j∈Ik
. Let F be any nontrivial vector space. We show that for
every family
(wi1,...,in
)(i1,...,in)∈I1×...×In
,
of vectors in F, there is some linear map h: E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En → F such that
h(u
1
i1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ u
n
in
) = wi1,...,in
.
Then by Proposition 33.4, it follows that
(u
1
i1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ u
n
in
)(i1,...,in)∈I1×...×In
is linearly independent. However, since (u
k
i
)i∈Ik
is a basis for Ek, the u
1
i1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ u
n
in
also
generate E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, and thus, they form a basis of E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En.
We define the function f : E1 × · · · × En → F as follows: For any n nonempty finite
subsets J1, . . . , Jn such that Jk ⊆ Ik for k = 1, . . . , n,
f(
X
j1∈J1

) = X
j1∈J1,...,jn∈Jn
v

· · · vj

n wj1,...,jn
.
It is immediately verified that f is multilinear. By the universal mapping property of the
tensor product, the linear map f⊗ : E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En → F such that f = f⊗ ◦ ϕ, is the desired
map h.
In particular, when each Ik is finite and of size mk = dim(Ek), we see that the dimension
of the tensor product E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En is m1 · · · mn. As a corollary of Proposition 33.12, if
(u
k
i
)i∈Ik
is a basis for Ek, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, then every tensor z ∈ E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En can be written in
a unique way as
z =

(i1,...,in) ∈ I1×...×In
λi1,...,in u

for some unique family of scalars λi1,...,in ∈ K, all zero except for a finite number.
33.4 Some Useful Isomorphisms for Tensor Products
Proposition 33.13. Given three vector spaces E, F, G, there exists unique canonical iso￾morphisms
(1) E ⊗ F ∼= F ⊗ E
1164 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
(2) (E ⊗ F) ⊗ G ∼= E ⊗ (F ⊗ G) ∼= E ⊗ F ⊗ G
(3) (E ⊕ F) ⊗ G ∼= (E ⊗ G) ⊕ (F ⊗ G)
(4) K ⊗ E ∼= E
such that respectively
(a) u ⊗ v 7→ v ⊗ u
(b) (u ⊗ v) ⊗ w 7→ u ⊗ (v ⊗ w) 7→ u ⊗ v ⊗ w
(c) (u, v) ⊗ w 7→ (u ⊗ w, v ⊗ w)
(d) λ ⊗ u 7→ λu.
Proof. Except for (3), these isomorphisms are proved using the universal mapping property
of tensor products.
(1) The map from E × F to F ⊗ E given by (u, v) 7→ v ⊗ u is clearly bilinear, thus it
induces a unique linear α: E ⊗ F → F ⊗ E making the following diagram commute
E × F

α
F ⊗ E,
such that
α(u ⊗ v) = v ⊗ u, for all u ∈ E and all v ∈ F .
Similarly, the map from F × E to E ⊗ F given by (v, u) 7→ u ⊗ v is clearly bilinear, thus it
induces a unique linear β : F ⊗ E → E ⊗ F making the following diagram commute
F × E



β
E ⊗ F,
such that
β(v ⊗ u) = u ⊗ v, for all u ∈ E and all v ∈ F .
It is immediately verified that
(β ◦ α)(u ⊗ v) = u ⊗ v and (α ◦ β)(v ⊗ u) = v ⊗ u
for all u ∈ E and all v ∈ F. Since the tensors of the form u ⊗ v span E ⊗ F and similarly
the tensors of the form v ⊗ u span F ⊗ E, the map β ◦ α is actually the identity on E ⊗ F,
and similarly α ◦ β is the identity on F ⊗ E, so α and β are isomorphisms.
33.4. SOME USEFUL ISOMORPHISMS FOR TENSOR PRODUCTS 1165
(2) Fix some w ∈ G. The map
(u, v) 7→ u ⊗ v ⊗ w
from E ×F to E ⊗F ⊗G is bilinear, and thus there is a linear map fw : E ⊗F → E ⊗F ⊗G
making the following diagram commute
E × F

with fw(u ⊗ v) = u ⊗ v ⊗ w.
Next consider the map
(z, w) 7→ fw(z),
from (E ⊗ F) × G into E ⊗ F ⊗ G. It is easily seen to be bilinear, and thus it induces a
linear map f : (E ⊗ F) ⊗ G → E ⊗ F ⊗ G making the following diagram commute

Also consider the map
(u, v, w) 7→ (u ⊗ v) ⊗ w
from E ×F ×G to (E ⊗F)⊗G. It is trilinear, and thus there is a linear map g : E ⊗F ⊗G →
(E ⊗ F) ⊗ G making the following diagram commute
E × F × G

g
(E ⊗ F) ⊗ G,
with g(u ⊗ v ⊗ w) = (u ⊗ v) ⊗ w. Clearly, f ◦ g and g ◦ f are identity maps, and thus f and
g are isomorphisms. The other case is similar.
(3) Given a fixed vector space G, for any two vector spaces M and N and every linear
map f : M → N, let τG(f) = f ⊗idG be the unique linear map making the following diagram
commute.

1166 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
The identity (∗) proved in Proposition 33.10 shows that if g : N → P is another linear map,
then
τG(g) ◦ τG(f) = (g ⊗ idG) ◦ (f ⊗ idG) = (g ◦ f) ⊗ (idG ◦ idG) = (g ◦ f) ⊗ idG = τG(g ◦ f).
Clearly, τG(0) = 0, and a direct computation on generators also shows that
τG(idM) = (idM ⊗ idG) = idM⊗G,
and that if f
0 : M → N is another linear map, then
τG(f + f
0 ) = τG(f) + τG(f
0 ).
In fancy terms, τG is a functor. Now, if E ⊕ F is a direct sum, it is a standard fact of linear
algebra that if πE : E ⊕ F → E and πF : E ⊕ F → F are the projection maps, then
πE ◦ πE = πE πF ◦ πF = πF πE ◦ πF = 0 πF ◦ πE = 0 πE + πF = idE⊕F .
If we apply τG to these identites, we get
τG(πE) ◦ τG(πE) = τG(πE) τG(πF ) ◦ τG(πF ) = τG(πF )
τG(πE) ◦ τG(πF ) = 0 τG(πF ) ◦ τG(πE) = 0 τG(πE) + τG(πF ) = id(E⊕F)⊗G.
Observe that τG(πE) = πE ⊗ idG is a map from (E ⊕ F) ⊗ G onto E ⊗ G and that τG(πF ) =
πF ⊗ idG is a map from (E ⊕ F) ⊗ G onto F ⊗ G, and by linear algebra, the above equations
mean that we have a direct sum
(E ⊗ G) ⊕ (F ⊗ G) ∼= (E ⊕ F) ⊗ G.
(4) We have the linear map  : E → K ⊗ E given by

(u) = 1 ⊗ u, for all u ∈ E.
The map (λ, u) 7→ λu from K × E to E is bilinear, so it induces a unique linear map
η : K ⊗ E → E making the following diagram commute
K × E
%▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲


η

such that η(λ ⊗ u) = λu, for all λ ∈ K and all u ∈ E. We have
(η ◦  )(u) = η(1 ⊗ u) = 1u = u,
and
( ◦ η)(λ ⊗ u) =  (λu) = 1 ⊗ (λu) = λ(1 ⊗ u) = λ ⊗ u,
which shows that both  ◦ η and η ◦  are the identity, so  and η are isomorphisms.
33.5. DUALITY FOR TENSOR PRODUCTS 1167
Remark:
L The isomorphism (3) can be generalized to finite and even arbitrary direct sums
i∈I Ei of vector spaces (where I is an arbitrary nonempty index set). We have an isomor￾phism

M
i∈I
Ei
 ⊗ G ∼=
M
i∈I
(Ei ⊗ G).
This isomorphism (with isomorphism (1)) can be used to give another proof of Proposition
33.12 (see Bertin [15], Chapter 4, Section 1) or Lang [109], Chapter XVI, Section 2).
Proposition 33.14. Given any three vector spaces E, F, G, we have the canonical isomor￾phism
Hom(E, F; G) ∼= Hom(E, Hom(F, G)).
Proof. Any bilinear map f : E × F → G gives the linear map ϕ(f) ∈ Hom(E, Hom(F, G)),
where ϕ(f)(u) is the linear map in Hom(F, G) given by
ϕ(f)(u)(v) = f(u, v).
Conversely, given a linear map g ∈ Hom(E, Hom(F, G)), we get the bilinear map ψ(g) given
by
ψ(g)(u, v) = g(u)(v),
and it is clear that ϕ and ψ and mutual inverses.
Since by Proposition 33.7 there is a canonical isomorphism
Hom(E ⊗ F, G) ∼= Hom(E, F; G),
together with the isomorphism
Hom(E, F; G) ∼= Hom(E, Hom(F, G))
given by Proposition 33.14, we obtain the important corollary:
Proposition 33.15. For any three vector spaces E, F, G, we have the canonical isomorphism
Hom(E ⊗ F, G) ∼= Hom(E, Hom(F, G)).
33.5 Duality for Tensor Products
