r ⊕ (A/ar+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am),
where A/ar+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am is the torsion submodule of M. The module M is free iff r = m,
and a torsion-module iff r = 0. In the latter case, the annihilator of M is a1.
1266 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
Proof. Since M is finitely generated and nontrivial, there is a surjective homomorphism
ϕ: An → M for some n ≥ 1, and M is isomorphic to An/Ker (ϕ). Since Ker (ϕ) is a submod￾ule of the free module An
, by Proposition 35.23, Ker (ϕ) is a free module and there is a basis
(e1, . . . , en) of An and some nonzero elements a1, . . . , aq (q ≤ n) such that (a1e1, . . . , aqeq) is
a basis of Ker (ϕ) and a1 | a2 | · · · | aq. Let aq+1 = . . . = an = 0.
By Proposition 35.24, we have an isomorphism
A
n
/Ker (ϕ) ≈ A/a1A ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/anA.
Whenever ai
is unit, the factor A/aiA = (0), so we can weed out the units. Let r = n − q,
and let s ∈ N be the smallest index such that as+1 is not a unit. Note that s = 0 means that
there are no units. Also, as M 6 = (0), s < n. Then,
M ≈ A
n
/Ker (ϕ) ≈ A/as+1A ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/anA.
Let m = r + q − s = n − s. Then, we have the sequence
a
|s+1, . . . , aq
{z
}
q−s
, aq+1, . . . , an
|
{z
}
r=n−q
,
where as+1 | as+2 | · · · | aq are nonzero and nonunits and aq+1 = · · · = an = 0, so we define
the m ideals ai as follows:
ai =
(
(0) if 1 ≤ i ≤ r
ar+q+1−iA if r + 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
With these definitions, the ideals ai are proper ideals and we have
ai ⊆ ai+1, i = 1, . . . , m − 1.
When r = 0, since as+1 | as+2 | · · · | an, it is clear that a1 = anA is the annihilator of M.
The other statements of the theorem are clear.
Example 35.1. Here is an example of Theorem 35.25. Let M be a Z-module with generators
{e1, e2, e3, e4} subject to the relations 6e3 = 0, 2e4 = 0. Then
M ∼= Z ⊕ Z ⊕ Z/6Z ⊕ Z/2Z,
where
a1 = (0), a2 = (0), a3 = (6), a4 = (2).
35.5. FINITELY GENERATED MODULES OVER A PID 1267
The natural number r is called the free rank or Betti number of the module M. The
generators α1, . . . , αm of the ideals a1, . . . , am (defined up to a unit) are often called the
invariant factors of M (in the notation of Theorem 35.25, the generators of the ideals
a1, . . . , am are denoted by aq, . . . , as+1, s ≤ q).
As corollaries of Theorem 35.25, we obtain again the following facts established in Section
35.1:
1. A finitely generated module over a PID is the direct sum of its torsion module and a
free module.
2. A finitely generated torsion-free module over a PID is free.
It turns out that the ideals a1 ⊆ a2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ am 6 = A are uniquely determined by the
module M. Uniqueness proofs found in most books tend to be intricate and not very intuitive.
The shortest proof that we are aware of is from Bourbaki [26] (Chapter VII, Section 4), and
uses wedge products.
The following preliminary results are needed.
Proposition 35.26. If A is a commutative ring and if a1, . . . , am are ideals of A, then there
is an isomorphism
A/a1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ A/am ≈ A/(a1 + · · · + am).
Sketch of proof. We proceed by induction on m. For m = 2, we define the map
ϕ: A/a1 × A/a2 → A/(a1 + a2) by
ϕ(a, b) = ab (mod a1 + a2).
It is well-defined because if a
0 = a + a1 and b
0 = b + a2 with a1 ∈ a1 and a2 ∈ a2, then
a
0 b
0 = (a + a1)(b + a2) = ab + ba1 + aa2 + a1a2,
and so
a
0 b
0 ≡ ab (mod a1 + a2).
It is also clear that this map is bilinear, so it induces a linear map ϕ: A/a1 ⊗ A/a2 →
A/(a1 + a2) such that ϕ(a ⊗ b) = ab (mod a1 + a2).
Next, observe that any arbitrary tensor
a1 ⊗ b1 + · · · + an ⊗ bn
in A/a1 ⊗ A/a2 can be rewritten as
1 ⊗ (a1b1 + · · · + anbn),
which is of the form 1 ⊗ s, with s ∈ A. We can use this fact to show that ϕ is injective and
surjective, and thus an isomorphism.
1268 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
For example, if ϕ(1 ⊗ s) = 0, because ϕ(1 ⊗ s) = s (mod a1 + a2), we have s ∈ a1 + a2,
so we can write s = a + b with a ∈ a1 and b ∈ a2. Then
1 ⊗ s = 1 ⊗ a + b
= 1 ⊗ (a + b)
= 1 ⊗ a + 1 ⊗ b
= a ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ b
= 0 + 0 = 0,
since a ∈ a1 and b ∈ a2, which proves injectivity.
Recall that the exterior algebra of an A-module M is defined by
^
M =
M
k≥0
k
^
(M).
Proposition 35.27. If A is a commutative ring, then for any n modules Mi, there is an
isomorphism
^
(

i=1
Mi) ≈
nO
i=1
^
Mi
.
A proof can be found in Bourbaki [25] (Chapter III, Section 7, No 7, Proposition 10).
Proposition 35.28. Let A be a commutative ring and let a1, . . . , an be n ideals of A. If the
module M is the direct sum of n cyclic modules
M = A/a1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/an,
then for every p > 0, the exterior power V p M is isomorphic to the direct sum of the modules
A/aH, where H ranges over all subsets H ⊆ {1, . . . , n} with p elements, and with
aH =
X
h∈H
ah.
Proof. If ui
is the image of 1 in A/ai
, then A/ai
is equal to Aui
. By Proposition 35.27, we
have
^
M ≈
nO

We also have

M = span{e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3 ∧ e4}.
Since 6e3 = 0, each element of {e1 ∧e3, e2 ∧e3, e1 ∧e2 ∧e3} is annihilated by 6Z = (6). Since
2e4 = 0, each element of {e1∧e4, e2∧e4, e3∧e4, e1∧e2∧e4, e1∧e3∧e4, e2∧e3∧e4, e1∧e2∧e3∧e4}
is annihilated by 2Z = (2). We have shown that
M ∼= Z ⊕ Z ⊕ Z/(6) ⊕ Z/(2),
where a1 = (0) = a2, a3 = (6),and a4 = (2). Then Proposition 35.28 implies that

1270 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
When the ideals ai
form a chain of inclusions a1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ an, we get the following
remarkable result.
Proposition 35.29. Let A be a commutative ring and let a1, . . . , an be n ideals of A such
that a1 ⊆ a2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ an. If the module M is the direct sum of n cyclic modules
M = A/a1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/an,
then for every p with 1 ≤ p ≤ n, the ideal ap is the annihilator of the exterior power V p M.
If an 6 = A, then V p M 6 = (0) for p = 1, . . . , n, and V p M = (0) for p > n.
Proof. With the notation of Proposition 35.28, we have aH = amax(H)
, where max(H) is the
greatest element in the set H. Since max(H) ≥ p for any subset with p elements and since
max(H) = p when H = {1, . . . , p}, we see that
ap =
\
H⊆{1,...,n}
|H|=p
aH.
By Proposition 35.28, we have
p
^
M ≈
M
H⊆{1,...,n}
|H|=p
A/aH
which proves that ap is indeed the annihilator of V p M. The rest is clear.
Example 35.1 continued: Recall that M is the Z-module generated by {e1, e2, e3, e4}
subject to 6e3 = 0, 2e2 = 0. Then
1
^
M = span{e1, e2, e3, e4}
2
^
M = span{e1 ∧ e2, e1 ∧ e3, e1 ∧ e4, e2 ∧ e3, e2 ∧ e4, e3 ∧ e4}

M = span{e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3, e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e4, e1 ∧ e3 ∧ e4, e2 ∧ e3 ∧ e4}
3
^
M = span{e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3 ∧ e4}.
Since e1 and e2 are free, e1 ∧ e2 is also free. Since 6e3 = 0, each element of {e1 ∧ e3, e2 ∧
e3, e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3} is annihilated by 6Z = (6). Since 2e4 = 0, each element of {e1 ∧ e4, e2 ∧
e4, e3 ∧ e4, e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e4, e1 ∧ e3 ∧ e4, e2 ∧ e3 ∧ e4, e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3 ∧ e4} is annihilated by 2Z = (2).

Then
Ann(

Ann(

Ann(

^
M) = Ann e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3 ∧ e4 = (2),
and Proposition 35.29 provides another verification of
M ∼= Z ⊕ Z ⊕ Z/(6) ⊕ Z/(2).
Propostion 35.29 immediately implies the following crucial fact.
Proposition 35.30. Let A be a commutative ring and let a1, . . . , am be m ideals of A and
a
01
, . . . , a
0n
be n ideals of A such that a1 ⊆ a2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ am 6 = A and a
01 ⊆ a
02 ⊆ · · · ⊆ a
0n 6 = A If
we have an isomorphism
A/a1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am ≈ A/a
01 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/a
0n
,
then m = n and ai = a
0i
for i = 1, . . . , n.
Proposition 35.30 yields the uniqueness of the decomposition in Theorem 35.25.
Theorem 35.31. (Invariant Factors Decomposition) Let M be a finitely generated nontrivial
A-module, where A a PID. Then, M is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic modules
M ≈ A/a1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am,
where the ai are proper ideals of A (possibly zero) such that
a1 ⊆ a2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ am 6 = A.
More precisely, if a1 = · · · = ar = (0) and (0) 6 = ar+1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ am 6 = A, then
M ≈ A
r ⊕ (A/ar+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am),
where A/ar+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am is the torsion submodule of M. The module M is free iff r = m,
and a torsion-module iff r = 0. In the latter case, the annihilator of M is a1. Furthermore,
the integer r and ideals a1 ⊆ a2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ am 6 = A are uniquely determined by M.
Proof. By Theorem 35.7, since Mtor = A/ar+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am, we know that the dimension r
of the free summand only depends on M. The uniqueness of the sequence of ideals follows
from Proposition 35.30.
1272 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
In view of the uniqueness part of Theorem 35.31, we make the following definition.
Definition 35.12. Given a finitely generated module M over a PID A as in Theorem 35.31,
the ideals ai = αiA are called the invariant factors of M. The generators αi of these ideals
(uniquely defined up to a unit) are also called the invariant factors of M.
Proposition 35.23 can be sharpened as follows:
Proposition 35.32. Let F be a finitely generated free module over a PID A, and let M be
any submodule of F. Then, M is a free module and there is a basis (e1, ..., en) of F, some
q ≤ n, and some nonzero elements a1, . . . , aq ∈ A, such that (a1e1, . . . , aqeq) is a basis of M
and ai divides ai+1 for all i, with 1 ≤ i ≤ q − 1. Furthermore, the free module M0 with basis
(e1, . . . , eq) and the ideals a1A, . . . , aqA are uniquely determined by M; the quotient module
M0 /M is the torsion module of F/M, and we have an isomorphism
M0 /M ≈ A/a1A ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/aqA.
Proof. Since ai 6 = 0 for i = 1, . . . , q, observe that
M0 = {x ∈ F | (∃β ∈ A, β 6 = 0)(βx ∈ M)},
which shows that M0 /M is the torsion module of F/M. Therefore, M0 is uniquely deter￾mined. Since
M = Aa1e1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ Aaqeq,
by Proposition 35.24 we have an isomorphism
M0 /M ≈ A/a1A ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/aqA.
Now, it is possible that the first s elements ai are units, in which case A/aiA = (0), so we
can eliminate such factors and we get
M0 /M ≈ A/as+1A ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/aqA,
with aqA ⊆ aq−1A ⊆ · · · ⊆ as+1A 6 = A. By Proposition 35.30, q − s and the ideals ajA are
uniquely determined for j = s + 1, . . . , q, and since a1A = · · · = asA = A, the q ideals aiA
are uniquely determined.
The ideals a1A, . . . , aqA of Proposition 35.32 are called the invariant factors of M with
respect to F. They should not be confused with the invariant factors of a module M.
It turns out that a1, . . . , aq can also be computed in terms of gcd’s of minors of a certain
matrix. Recall that if X is an m × n matrix, then a k × k minor of X is the determinant of
any k×k matrix obtained by picking k columns of X, and then k rows from these k columns.
35.5. FINITELY GENERATED MODULES OVER A PID 1273
Proposition 35.33. Let F be a free module of finite dimension over a PID, (u1, . . . , un)
be a basis of F, M be a submodule of F, and (x1, . . . , xm) be a set of generators of M. If
a1A, . . . , aqA are the invariant factors of M with respect to F as in Proposition 35.32, then
for k = 1, . . . , q, the product a1 · · · ak is a gcd of the k × k minors of the n × m matrix XU
whose columns are the coordinates of the xj over the ui.
Proof. Proposition 35.23 shows that M ⊆ a1F. Consequently, the coordinates of any element
of M are multiples of a1. On the other hand, we know that there is a linear form f for which
a1A is a maximal ideal and some e
0 ∈ M such that f(e
0 ) = a1. If we write e
0 as a linear
combination of the xi
, we see that a1 belongs to the ideal spanned by the coordinates of the
xi over the basis (u1, . . . , un). Since these coordinates are all multiples of a1, it follows that
a1 is their gcd, which proves the case k = 1.
For any k ≥ 2, consider the exterior power V k M. Using the notation of the proof
of Proposition 35.23, the module M has the basis (a1e1, . . . , aqeq), so V k M has a basis
consisting of elements of the form
ai1
ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ aik
eik = ai1
· · · aik
ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
,
for all sequences (i1, . . . , ik) such that 1 ≤ i1 < i2 < · · · < ik ≤ q. However, the vectors
ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
form a basis of V k
F. Thus, the map from V k M into V k
F induced by the
inclusion M ⊆ F defines an isomorphism of V k M onto the submodule of V k
F having the
elements ai1
· · · aik
ei1 ∧ · · · ∧ eik
as a basis. Since aj
is a multiple of the ai
for i < j, the
products ai1
· · · aik
are all multiples of δk = a1 · · · ak, and one of these is equal to δk. The
reasoning used for k = 1 shows that δk is a gcd of the set of coordinates of any spanning set of
V
k M over any basis of V k
F. If we pick as basis of V k
F the wedge products ui1 ∧ · · · ∧ uik
,
and as generators of V k M the wedge products xi1 ∧ · · · ∧ xik
, it is easy to see that the
coordinates of the xi1 ∧ · · · ∧ xik
are indeed determinants which are the k × k minors of the
matrix XU .
Proposition 35.33 yields a1, . . . , aq (up to units) as follows: First, a1 is a gcd of the entries
in XU . Having computed a1, . . . , ak, let bk = a1 · · · , ak, compute bk+1 = a1 · · · akak+1 as a
gcd of all the (k + 1) × (k + 1) minors of XU , and then ak+1 is obtained by dividing bk+1 by
bk (recall that a PID is an integral domain).
We also have the following interesting result about linear maps between free modules
over a PID.
Proposition 35.34. Let A be a PID, let F be a free module of dimension n, F
0 be a free
module of dimension m, and f : F → F
0 be a linear map from F to F
0 . Then, there exist a
basis (e1, . . . , en) of F, a basis (e
01
, . . . , e0m) of F
0 , and some nonzero elements α1, . . . αr ∈ A
such that
f(ei) = ( αie
0i
if 1 ≤ i ≤ r
0 if r + 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
1274 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
and α1 | α2 | · · · | αr. Furthermore, the ideals α1A, . . . , αrA are the invariant factors of f(F)
with respect F
0 .
Proof. Let F0 be the kernel of f. Since M0 = f(F) is a submodule of the free module F
0 , it
is free, and similarly F0 is free as a submodule of the free module F (by Proposition 35.23).
By Proposition 35.2, we have
F = F0 ⊕ F1,
where F1 is a free module, and the restriction of f to F1 is an isomorphism onto M0 =
f(F). Proposition 35.32 applied to F
0 and M0 yields a basis (e
01
, . . . , e0m) of F
0 such that
(α1e
01
, . . . , αre
0r
) is a basis of M0 , where α1A, . . . , αrA are the invariant factors for M0 with
respect to F
0 . Since the restriction of f to F1 is and isomorphism, there is a basis (e1, . . . , er)
of F1 such that
f(ei) = αie
0i
, i = 1, . . . , r.
We can extend this basis to a basis of F by picking a basis of F0 (a free module), which
yields the desired result.
The matrix version of Proposition 35.34 is the following proposition.
Proposition 35.35. If X is an m×n matrix of rank r over a PID A, then there exist some
invertible n × n matrix P, some invertible m × m matrix Q, and a m × n matrix D of the
form
D =


for some nonzero αi ∈ A, such that
(1) α1 | α2 | · · · | αr,
(2) X = QDP −1
, and
(3) The αis are uniquely determined up to a unit.
The ideals α1A, . . . , αrA are called the invariant factors of the matrix X. Recall that
two m × n matrices X and Y are equivalent iff
Y = QXP −1
,
for some invertible matrices, P and Q. Then, Proposition 35.35 implies the following fact.
35.5. FINITELY GENERATED MODULES OVER A PID 1275
Proposition 35.36. Two m × n matrices X and Y are equivalent iff they have the same
invariant factors.
If X is the matrix of a linear map f : F → F
0 with respect to some basis (u1, . . . , un)
of F and some basis (u
01
, . . . , u0m) of F
0 , then the columns of X are the coordinates of the
f(uj ) over the u
0i
, where the f(uj ) generate f(F), so Proposition 35.33 applies and yields
the following result:
Proposition 35.37. If X is a m × n matrix or rank r over a PID A, and if α1A, . . . , αrA
are its invariant factors, then α1 is a gcd of the entries in X, and for k = 2, . . . , r, the
product α1 · · · αk is a gcd of all k × k minors of X.
There are algorithms for converting a matrix X over a PID to the form X = QDP −1
as described in Proposition 35.35. For Euclidean domains, this can be achieved by using
the elementary row and column operations P(i, k), Ei,j;β, and Ei,λ described in Chapter 8,
where we require the scalar λ used in Ei,λ to be a unit. For an arbitrary PID, another kind
of elementary matrix (containing some 2 × 2 submatrix in addition to diagonal entries) is
needed. These procedures involve computing gcd’s and use the Bezout identity to mimic
division. Such methods are presented in D. Serre [156], Jacobson [98], and Van Der Waerden
[179], and sketched in Artin [7]. We describe and justify several of these methods in Section
36.5.
Proposition 35.32 has the following two applications.
First, consider a finitely presented module M over a PID given by some m × n matrix
R. By Proposition 35.35, the matrix R can be diagonalized as R = QDP −1 where D is a
diagonal matrix. Then, we see that M has a presentation with m generators and r relations
of the form
αiei = 0,
where αi 6 = 0 and α1 | α2 | · · · | αr.
For the second application, let F be a free module with basis (e1, . . . , en), and let M be
a submodule of F generated by m vectors v1, . . . , vm in F. The module M can be viewed as
the set of linear combinations of the columns of the n× m matrix also denoted M consisting
of the coordinates of the vectors v1, . . . , vm over the basis (e1, . . . , en). Then by Proposition
35.35, the matrix R can be diagonalized as R = QDP −1 where D is a diagonal matrix. The
columns of Q form a basis (e
01
, . . . , e0n
) of F, and since RP = QD, the nonzero columns of
RP form the basis (a1e
01
, . . . , aqe
0q
) of M.
When the ring A is a Euclidean domain, Theorem 36.18 shows that P and Q are products
of elementary row and column operations. In particular, when A = Z, in which cases our
Z-modules are abelian groups, we can find P and Q using Euclidean division.
If A = Z, a finitely generated submodule M of Z
n
is called a lattice. It is given as the
set of integral linear combinations of a finite set of integral vectors.

Here is an example taken from Artin [7] (Chapter 12, Section 4). Let F be the free
Z-module Z

, and let M be the lattice generated by the columns of the matrix
R =

The columns (u1, u2) of R are linearly independent, but they are not a basis of Z
2
. For
example, in order to obtain e1 as a linear combination of these columns, we would need to
solve the linear system
2x − y = 1
x + 2y = 0.
From the second equation, we get x = −2y, which yields
−5y = 1.
But, y = −1/5 is not an integer. We leave it as an exercise to check that

The new basis (u

of the columns (u

The invariant factor decomposition of a finitely generated module M over a PID A given
by Theorem 35.31 says that
Mtor ≈ A/ar+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am,
a direct sum of cyclic modules, with (0) 6 = ar+1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ am 6 = A. Using the Chinese
Remainder Theorem (Theorem 32.15), we can further decompose each module A/αiA into
a direct sum of modules of the form A/pnA, where p is a prime in A.

Theorem 35.38. (Elementary Divisors Decomposition) Let M be a finitely generated non￾trivial A-module, where A a PID. Then, M is isomorphic to the direct sum Ar ⊕Mtor, where
Ar
is a free module and where the torsion module Mtor is a direct sum of cyclic modules of
the form A/pn
i
i,j , for some primes p1, . . . , pt ∈ A and some positive integers ni,j , such that
for each i = 1, . . . , t, there is a sequence of integers
1 ≤

with si ≥ 1, and where ni,j occurs mi,j ≥ 1 times, for j = 1, . . . , si. Furthermore, the
irreducible elements pi and the integers r, t, ni,j , si
, mi,j are uniquely determined.
Proof. By Theorem 35.31, we already know that M ≈ Ar ⊕ Mtor, where r is uniquely
determined, and where
Mtor ≈ A/ar+1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ A/am,
a direct sum of cyclic modules, with (0) 6 = ar+1 ⊆ · · · ⊆ am 6 = A. Then, each ai
is a principal
ideal of the form αiA, where αi 6 = 0 and αi
is not a unit. Using the Chinese Remainder
Theorem (Theorem 32.15), if we factor αi
into prime factors as
αi = upk

with kj ≥ 1, we get an isomorphism

1278 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
This implies that Mtor is the direct sum of modules of the form A/pn
i
i,j , for some primes
pi ∈ A.
To prove uniqueness, observe that the pi-primary component of Mtor is the direct sum
(A/pn

mi,1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ (A/pn

and these are uniquely determined. Since ni,1 < · · · < ni,si
, we have

i A ⊆ · · · ⊆ p
n

i,1A 6 = A,
Proposition 35.30 implies that the irreducible elements pi and ni,j , si
, and mi,j are unique.
In view of Theorem 35.38, we make the following definition.
Definition 35.13. Given a finitely generated module M over a PID A as in Theorem 35.38,
the ideals p
n
i
i,jA are called the elementary divisors of M, and the mi,j are their multiplicities.
The ideal (0) is also considered to be an elementary divisor and r is its multiplicity.
Remark: Theorem 35.38 shows how the elementary divisors are obtained from the invariant
factors: the elementary divisors are the prime power factors of the invariant factors.
Conversely, we can get the invariant factors from the elementary divisors. We may assume
that M is a torsion module. Let
m = max
1≤i≤t
{mi,1 + · · · + mi,si
},
and construct the t × m matrix C = (cij ) whose ith row is the sequence

padded with 0’s if necessary to make it of length m. Then, the jth invariant factor is
αjA = p1
c1j
p2

· · · p

tjA.
Observe that because the last column contains at least one prime, the αi are not units, and
αm | αm−1 | · · · | α1, so that α1A ⊆ · · · ⊆ αm−1A ⊆ αmA 6 = A, as desired.
From a computational point of view, finding the elementary divisors is usually practically
impossible, because it requires factoring. For example, if A = K[X] where K is a field, such
as K = R or K = C, factoring amounts to finding the roots of a polynomial, but by Galois
theory, in general, this is not algorithmically doable. On the other hand, the invariant factors
can be computed using elementary row and column operations.
It can also be shown that A and the modules of the form A/pnA are indecomposable
(with n > 0). A module M is said to be indecomposable if M cannot be written as a direct
35.6. EXTENSION OF THE RING OF SCALARS 1279
sum of two nonzero proper submodules of M. For a proof, see Bourbaki [26] (Chapter VII,
Section 4, No. 8, Proposition 8). Theorem 35.38 shows that a finitely generated module over
a PID is a direct sum of indecomposable modules.
In Chapter 36 we apply the structure theorems for finitely generated (torsion) modules
to the K[X]-module Ef associated with an endomorphism f on a vector space E. First, we
need to understand the process of extension of the ring of scalars.
35.6 Extension of the Ring of Scalars
The need to extend the ring of scalars arises, in particular when dealing with eigenvalues.
First we need to define how to restrict scalar multiplication to a subring. The situation is
that we have two rings A and B, a B-module M, and a ring homomorphism ρ: A → B. The
special case that arises often is that A is a subring of B (B could be a field) and ρ is the
inclusion map. Then we can make M into an A-module by defining the scalar multiplication
·: A × M → M as follows.
Definition 35.14. Given two rings A and B and a ring homomorphism ρ: A → B, any B￾module M can made into an A-module denoted by ρ∗(M), by defining scalar multiplication
by any element of A as follows:
a · x = ρ(a)x, for all a ∈ A and all x ∈ M.
In particular, viewing B as a B-module, we obtain the A-module ρ∗(B).
If M and N are two B-modules and if f : M → N is a B-linear map, the map f is a
homomorphism f : ρ∗(M) → ρ∗(N) of the abelian groups ρ∗(M) and ρ∗(N). This map is
also A-linear, because for all u ∈ M and all a ∈ A, by definition of the scalar multiplication
by elements of A, we have
f(a · u) = f(ρ(a)u) = ρ(a)f(u) = a · f(u).
The map f : ρ∗(M) → ρ∗(N) viewed as an A-linear map is denoted by ρ∗(f). As homomor￾phisms of abelian groups, the maps f : M → N and ρ∗(f): ρ∗(M) → ρ∗(N) are identical,
but f is a B-linear map whereas ρ∗(f) is an A-linear map.
Now we can describe the process of scalar extension. Given any A-module M, we make
ρ∗(B) ⊗A M into a (left) B-module as follows: for every β ∈ B, let µβ : ρ∗(B) × M →
ρ∗(B) ⊗A M be given by
µβ(β
0 , x) = (ββ0 ) ⊗ x.
The map µβ is bilinear so it induces a linear map µβ : ρ∗(B) ⊗A M → ρ∗(B) ⊗A M such that
µβ(β
0 ⊗ x) = (ββ0 ) ⊗ x.
1280 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
If we define the scalar multiplication ·: B × (ρ∗(B) ⊗A M) → ρ∗(B) ⊗A M by
β · z = µβ(z), for all β ∈ B and all z ∈ ρ∗(B) ⊗A M,
then it is easy to check that the axioms M1, M2, M3, M4 hold. Let us check M2 and M3.
We have
µβ1+β2
(β
0 ⊗ x) = (β1 + β2)β
0 ⊗ x
= (β1β
0 + β2β
0 ) ⊗ x
= β1β
0 ⊗ x + β2β
0 ⊗ x
= µβ1
(β
0 ⊗ x) + µβ2
(β
0 ⊗ x)
and
µβ1β2
(β
0 ⊗ x) = β1β2β
0 ⊗ x
= µβ1
(β2β
0 ⊗ x)
= µβ1
(µβ2
(β
0 ⊗ x)).
Definition 35.15. Given two rings A and B and a ring homomorphism ρ: A → B, for any
A-module M, with the scalar multiplication by elements of B given by
β · (β
0 ⊗ x) = (ββ0 ) ⊗ x, β, β0 ∈ B, x ∈ M,
the tensor product ρ∗(B) ⊗A M is a B-module denoted by ρ
∗
(M), or M(B) when ρ is the
inclusion of A into B. The B-module ρ
∗
(M) is sometimes called the module induced from
M by extension to B of the ring of scalars through ρ.
Here is a specific example of Definition 35.15. Let A = R, B = C and ρ be the inclusion
map of R into C, i.e. ρ: R → C with ρ(a) = a for a ∈ R. Let M be an R-module. The field
C is a C-module, and when we restrict scalar multiplication by scalars λ ∈ R, we obtain
the R-module ρ∗(C) (which, as an abelian group, is just C). Form ρ∗(C) ⊗R M. This is
an R-module where typical elements have the form P n
i=1 ai(zi ⊗ mi), ai ∈ R, zi ∈ C, and
mi ∈ M. Since
ai(zi ⊗ mi) = aizi ⊗ mi
and since aizi ∈ C and any element of C is obtained this way (let ai = 1), the elements of
ρ∗(C) ⊗R M can be written as
nX
i=1
zi ⊗ mi
, zi ∈ C, mi ∈ M.
We want to make ρ∗(C) ⊗R M into a C-module, denoted ρ
∗
(M), and thus must describe
how a complex number β acts on P n
i=1 zi ⊗ mi
. By linearity, it is enough to determine how
β = u + iv acts on a generator z ⊗ m, where z = x + iy and m ∈ M. The action is given by
β · (z ⊗ m) = βz ⊗ m = (u + iv)(x + iy) ⊗ m = (ux − vy + i(uy + vx)) ⊗ m,
35.6. EXTENSION OF THE RING OF SCALARS 1281
since complex multiplication only makes sense over C.
We claim that ρ
∗
(M) is isomorphic to the C-module M × M with addition defined by
(u1, v1) + (u2, v2) = (u1 + u2, v1 + v2)
and scalar multiplication by λ + iµ ∈ C as
(λ + iµ) · (u, v) = (λu − µv, λv + µu).
Define the map α0 : ρ∗(C) × M → M × M by
α0(λ + iµ, u) = (λu, µu).
It is easy to check that α0 is R-linear, so we obtain an R-linear map α: ρ∗(C)⊗RM → M ×M
such that
α((λ + iµ) ⊗ u) = (λu, µu).
We also define the map β : M × M → ρ∗(C) ⊗R M by
β(u, v) = 1 ⊗ u + i ⊗ v.
Again, it is clear that this map is R-linear. We can now check that α and β are mutual
inverses. We have
α(β(u, v)) = α(1 ⊗ u + i ⊗ v) = α(1 ⊗ u) + α(i ⊗ v) = (u, 0) + (0, v) = (u, v),
and on generators,
β(α((λ + iµ) ⊗ u)) = β(λu, µu) = 1 ⊗ λu + i ⊗ µu = λ ⊗ u + iµ ⊗ u = (λ + iµ) ⊗ u.
Therefore, ρ∗(C)⊗R M and M ×M are isomorphic as R-module. However, the isomorphism
α is also an isomorphism of C-modules. This is because in ρ∗(C) ⊗R M, on generators we
have
(λ + iµ) · ((x + iy) ⊗ u) = (λ + iµ)(x + iy) ⊗ u = (λx − µy + i(λy + µx)) ⊗ u,
so
α((λ + iµ) · ((x + iy) ⊗ u) = α((λx − µy + i(λy + µx)) ⊗ u)
= ((λx − µy)u,(λy + µx)u),
and by definition of the scalar multiplication by elements of C on M × M
(λ + iµ) · α((x + iy) ⊗ u) = (λ + iµ) · (xu, yu) = ((λx − µy)u,(λy + µx)u).
Therefore, α is an isomorphism between the C-modules ρ
∗
(M) = ρ∗(C) ⊗R M and M × M.
The above process of ring extension can also be applied to linear maps. We have the
following proposition whose proof is given in Bourbaki [25] (Chapter II, Section 5, Proposition
1).
1282 CHAPTER 35. INTRODUCTION TO MODULES; MODULES OVER A PID
Proposition 35.39. Given a ring homomomorphism ρ: A → B and given any A-module
M, the map ϕ: M → ρ∗(ρ

(M)) given by ϕ(x) = 1 ⊗A x is A-linear and ϕ(M) spans the
B-module ρ

(M). For every B-module N, and for every A-linear map f : M → ρ∗(N), there
is a unique B-linear map
f : ρ

such that
ρ∗(f) ◦ ϕ = f

or equivalently,
f(1 ⊗A x) = f(x), for all x ∈ M.
As a consequence of Proposition 35.39, we obtain the following result.
Proposition 35.40. Given a ring homomomorphism ρ: A → B, for any two A-modules M
and N, for every A-linear map f : M → N, there is a unique B-linear map ρ
∗
(f): ρ

Proof. Apply Proposition 35.40 to the A-linear map ϕN ◦ f.
If S spans the module M, it is clear that ϕ(S) spans ρ
∗
(M). In particular, if M is finitely
generated, so if ρ
∗
(M). Bases of M also extend to bases of ρ
∗
(M).
Proposition 35.41. Given a ring homomomorphism ρ: A → B, for any A-module M, if
(u1, . . . , un) is a basis of M, then (ϕ(u1), . . . , ϕ(un)) is a basis of ρ
∗
(M), where ϕ is the
A-linear map ϕ: M → ρ∗(ρ
∗
(M)) given by ϕ(x) = 1 ⊗A x. Furthermore, if ρ is injective,
then so is ϕ.
Proof. The first assertion follows immediately from Proposition 35.13, since it asserts that
every element z of ρ

(M) = ρ∗(B) ⊗A M can be written in a unique way as
z = b1 ⊗ u1 + · · · + bn ⊗ un = b1(1 ⊗ u1) + · · · + bn(1 ⊗ un),

and ϕ(ui) = 1 ⊗ ui
. Next, if ρ is injective, by definition of the scalar multiplication in the
A-module ρ∗(ρ
