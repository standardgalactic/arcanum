shows that b Ω is a bijection.

Proposition 25.4 gives a nice interpretation of the sum operation + of b Eb. Given two
weighted points h a1, λ1i and h a2, λ2i , we have
h
a1, λ1i +b h a2, λ2i = Ωb

(Ω( bh a1, λ1i ) + Ω( bh a2, λ2i )).
The operation Ω( bh a1, λ1i )+ bΩ(h a2, λ2i ) has a simple geometric interpretation. If λ1 +λ2 6 = 0,
then find the points M1 and M2 on the lines passing through the origin Ω of F and the points
A1 = b Ω(a1) and A2 = b Ω(a2) in the hyperplane H, such that −−→ΩM1 = λ1

and consider the intersection G of the line passing through Ω and N with the hyperplane H.
Then, G is the barycenter of A1 and A2 assigned the weights λ1/(λ1 + λ2) and λ2/(λ1 + λ2),
and if g = b Ω

Instead of adding the vectors −−→ΩM1 and −−→ΩM2, we can take the middle N0 of the segment
M1M2, and G is the intersection of the line passing through Ω and N0 with the hyperplane
H as illustrated in Figure 25.5.

If λ1 + λ2 = 0, then h a1, λ1i +b h a2, λ2i is a vector determined as follows. Again, find the
points M1 and M2 on the lines passing through the origin Ω of F and the points A1 = b Ω(a1)
and A2 = b Ω(a2) in the hyperplane H, such that −−→ΩM1 = λ1

the vectors −−→ΩM1 and −−→ΩM2, getting a point N such that −−→ΩN =

−−→ΩM2. The desired
vector is
−−→ΩN, which is parallel to the line A1A2. Equivalently, let N0 be the middle of the
segment M1M2, and the desired vector is 2
−−→
ΩN0 . See Figure 25.6.
We can also give a geometric interpretation of h a, λi +u. Let A = b Ω(a) in the hyperplane
H, let D be the line determined by A and u, let M1 be the point such that −−→ΩM1 = λ
−→ΩA, and
let M2 be the point such that −−→ΩM2 = u, that is, M2 = Ω + u. By construction, the line D is
in the hyperplane H, and it is parallel to −−→ΩM2, so that D, M1, and M2 are coplanar. Then,
add the vectors −−→ΩM1 and −−→ΩM2, getting a point N such that −−→ΩN =
−−→ΩM1 +
−−→ΩM2, and let G
be the intersection of the line determined by Ω and N with the line D. If g = b Ω

then, b Ω

the intersection of the line determined by Ω and N0 , with the line D; see Figure 25.7.

25.4 Extending Affine Maps to Linear Maps
Roughly, the vector space Eb has the property that for any vector space −→F and any affine
map f : E →
−→F , there is a unique linear map fb : Eb →
−→F extending f : E →
−→F . As a
consequence, given two affine spaces E and F, every affine map f : E → F extends uniquely
to a linear map b f : b E → b F. First, we define rigorously the notion of homogenization of an
affine space.
Definition 25.2. Given any affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 , a homogenization (or linearization) of
(E,
−→E ) is a triple hE, j, ωi , where E is a vector space, j : E → E is an injective affine
map with associated injective linear map i:

that ω

f : E →

following diagram:

(0). Note that we
could have defined a homogenization of an affine space (E,
−→E ), as a triple hE, j, Hi , where
E is a vector space, H is an affine hyperplane in E, and j : E → E is an injective affine map
such that j(E) = H, and such that the universal property stated above holds. However,
Definition 25.2 is more convenient for our purposes, since it makes the notion of weight more
evident.
The obvious candidate for E is the vector space b E that we just constructed. The next
proposition will show that b E indeed has the required extension property. As usual, objects

exercise.
Proposition 25.5. Given any affine space ￾ E,
−→E
 and any vector space −→F , for any affine
map f : E →
−→F , there is a unique linear map fb : Eb →
−→F extending f such that
fb(u +b λa) = λf(a) + −→f (u)
for all a ∈ E, all u ∈
−→E , and all λ ∈ R, where
−→f is the linear map associated with f. In
particular, when λ 6 = 0, we have
fb(u +b λa) = λf(a + λ
−1u).
Proof. Assuming that b f exists, recall that from Proposition 25.1, for every a ∈ E, every
element of b E can be written uniquely as u b + λa. By linearity of b f and since b f extends f, we
have
fb(u +b λa) = fb(u) + λfb(a) = fb(u) + λf(a) = λf(a) + fb(u).
If λ = 1, since a b + u and a + u are identified, and since b f extends f, we must have
f(a) + fb(u) = fb(a) + fb(u) = fb(a +b u) = f(a + u) = f(a) + −→f (u),
852 CHAPTER 25. EMBEDDING AN AFFINE SPACE IN A VECTOR SPACE
and thus fb(u) = −→f (u) for all u ∈
−→E . Then we have
fb(u +b λa) = λf(a) + −→f (u),
which proves the uniqueness of fb. On the other hand, the map fb defined as above is clearly
a linear map extending f.
When λ 6 = 0, we have
fb(u +b λa) = fb(λ(a + λ
−1u)) = λfb(a + λ
−1u) = λf(a + λ
−1u).
Proposition 25.5 shows that 
 E, j, ω b , is a homogenization of ￾ E,
−→E
 . As a corollary, we
obtain the following proposition.
Proposition 25.6. Given two affine spaces E and F and an affine map f : E → F, there
is a unique linear map fb : Eb → Fb extending f, as in the diagram below,
E

such that
fb(u +b λa) = −→f (u) +b λf(a),
for all a ∈ E, all u ∈
−→E , and all λ ∈ R, where
−→f is the linear map associated with f. In
particular, when λ 6 = 0, we have
fb(u +b λa) = λf(a + λ
−1u).
Proof. Consider the vector space b F and the affine map j ◦ f : E → b F. By Proposition 25.5,
there is a unique linear map b f : b E → b F extending j ◦ f, and thus extending f.
Note that fb : Eb → Fb has the property that b f
￾
−→E
 ⊆
−→F . More generally, since
fb(u +b λa) = −→f (u) +b λf(a),
the linear map fb is weight-preserving. Also observe that we recover f from fb, by letting
λ = 1 in fb(u +b λa) = λf(a + λ
−1u), that is, we have
f(a + u) = fb(u +b a).
25.4. EXTENDING AFFINE MAPS TO LINEAR MAPS 853
From a practical point of view, Proposition 25.6 shows us how to homogenize an affine
map to turn it into a linear map between the two homogenized spaces. Assume that E
and F are of finite dimension, that (a0,(u1, . . . , un)) is an affine frame of E with origin a0,
and (b0,(v1, . . . , vm)) is an affine frame of F with origin b0. Then, with respect to the two
bases (u1, . . . , un, a0) in Eb and (v1, . . . , vm, b0) in Fb, a linear map h: Eb → Fb is given by an
(m + 1) × (n + 1) matrix A. Assume that this linear map h is equal to the homogenized
version fb of an affine map f. Since
fb(u +b λa) = −→f (u) +b λf(a),
and since over the basis (u1, . . . , un, a0) in b E, points are represented by vectors whose last
coordinate is 1 and vectors are represented by vectors whose last coordinate is 0, the following
properties hold.
1. The last row of the matrix A = M(fb) with respect to the given bases is
(0, 0, . . . , 0, 1)
with n occurrences of 0.
2. The last column of A contains the coordinates
(µ1, . . . , µm, 1)
of f(a0) with respect to the basis (v1, . . . , vm, b0).
3. The submatrix of A obtained by deleting the last row and the last column is the matrix
of the linear map −→f with respect to the bases (u1, . . . , un) and (v1, . . . , vm),
Finally, since
f(a0 + u) = fb(u +b a0),
given any x ∈ E and y ∈ F with coordinates (x1, . . . , xn, 1) and (y1, . . . , ym, 1), for X =
(x1, . . . , xn, 1)> and Y = (y1, . . . , ym, 1)> , we have y = f(x) iff
Y = AX.
For example, consider the following affine map f : A
2 → A
2 defined as follows:
y1 = ax1 + bx2 + µ1,
y2 = cx1 + dx2 + µ2.
The matrix of fb is

which means that the homogeneous map fb is is obtained from f by “adding the variable of

y2 = cx1 + dx2 + µ2x3,
y3 = x3.

Basics of Projective Geometry
Think geometrically, prove algebraically.
—John Tate
26.1 Why Projective Spaces?
For a novice, projective geometry usually appears to be a bit odd, and it is not obvious to
motivate why its introduction is inevitable and in fact fruitful. One of the main motivations
arises from algebraic geometry.
The main goal of algebraic geometry is to study the properties of geometric objects, such
as curves and surfaces, defined implicitly in terms of algebraic equations. For instance, the
equation
x
2 + y
2 − 1 = 0
defines a circle in R
2
. More generally, we can consider the curves defined by general equations
ax2 + by2 + cxy + dx + ey + f = 0
of degree 2, known as conics. It is then natural to ask whether it is possible to classify
these curves according to their generic geometric shape. This is indeed possible. Except
for so-called singular cases, we get ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. The same question
can be asked for surfaces defined by quadratic equations, known as quadrics, and again, a
classification is possible. However, these classifications are a bit artificial. For example, an
ellipse and a hyperbola differ by the fact that a hyperbola has points at infinity, and yet,
their geometric properties are identical, provided that points at infinity are handled properly.
Another important problem is the study of intersection of geometric objects (defined
algebraically). For example, given two curves C1 and C2 of degree m and n, respectively,
what is the number of intersection points of C1 and C2? (by degree of the curve we mean
the total degree of the defining polynomial).
855
856 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
Well, it depends! Even in the case of lines (when m = n = 1), there are three possibilities:
either the lines coincide, or they are parallel, or there is a single intersection point. In general,
we expect mn intersection points, but some of these points may be missing because they are
at infinity, because they coincide, or because they are imaginary.
What begins to transpire is that “points at infinity” cause trouble. They cause exceptions
that invalidate geometric theorems (for example, consider the more general versions of the
theorems of Pappus and Desargues), and make it difficult to classify geometric objects.
Projective geometry is designed to deal with “points at infinity” and regular points in a
uniform way, without making a distinction. Points at infinity are now just ordinary points,
and many things become simpler. For example, the classification of conics and quadrics
becomes simpler, and intersection theory becomes cleaner (although, to be honest, we need
to consider complex projective spaces).
Technically, projective geometry can be defined axiomatically, or by building upon linear
algebra. Historically, the axiomatic approach came first (see Veblen and Young [183, 184],
Emil Artin [6], and Coxeter [45, 46, 43, 44]). Although very beautiful and elegant, we believe
that it is a harder approach than the linear algebraic approach. In the linear algebraic
approach, all notions are considered up to a scalar. For example, a projective point is really
a line through the origin. In terms of coordinates, this corresponds to “homogenizing.” For
example, the homogeneous equation of a conic is
ax2 + by2 + cxy + dxz + eyz + fz2 = 0.
Now, regular points are points of coordinates (x, y, z) with z 6 = 0, and points at infinity
are points of coordinates (x, y, 0) (with x, y, z not all null, and up to a scalar). There is a
useful model (interpretation) of plane projective geometry in terms of the central projection
in R
3
from the origin onto the plane z = 1. Another useful model is the spherical (or the
half-spherical) model. In the spherical model, a projective point corresponds to a pair of
antipodal points on the sphere.
As affine geometry is the study of properties invariant under affine bijections, projective
geometry is the study of properties invariant under bijective projective maps. Roughly
speaking, projective maps are linear maps up to a scalar. In analogy with our presentation
of affine geometry, we will define projective spaces, projective subspaces, projective frames,
and projective maps. The analogy will fade away when we define the projective completion
of an affine space, and when we define duality.
One of the virtues of projective geometry is that it yields a very clean presentation of
rational curves and rational surfaces. The general idea is that a plane rational curve is the
projection of a simpler curve in a larger space, a polynomial curve in R
3
, onto the plane
z = 1, as we now explain.
Polynomial curves are curves defined parametrically in terms of polynomials. More specif￾ically, if E is an affine space of finite dimension n ≥ 2 and (a0,(e1, . . . , en)) is an affine frame
26.1. WHY PROJECTIVE SPACES? 857
for E, a polynomial curve of degree m is a map F : A → E such that
F(t) = a0 + F1(t)e1 + · · · + Fn(t)en,
for all t ∈ A, where F1(t), . . . , Fn(t) are polynomials of degree at most m.
Although many curves can be defined, it is somewhat embarassing that a circle cannot
be defined in such a way. In fact, many interesting curves cannot be defined this way, for
example, ellipses and hyperbolas. A rather simple way to extend the class of curves defined
parametrically is to allow rational functions instead of polynomials. A parametric rational
curve of degree m is a function F : A → E such that
F(t) = a0 +
F1(t)
Fn+1(t)
e1 + · · · +
Fn(t)
Fn+1(t)
en,
for all t ∈ A, where F1(t), . . . , Fn(t), Fn+1(t) are polynomials of degree at most m. For
example, a circle in A
2
can be defined by the rational map
F(t) = a0 +
1 − t
2
1 + t
2
e1 +
2t
1 + t
2
e2.
In terms of coordinates, the above curve is given by
x =
1 − t
2
1 + t
2
y =
2t
1 + t
2
,
and it is easily checked that x
2 + y
2 = 1. Note that the point (−1, 0) is not achieved for any
finite value of t, but it is for t = ∞.
In the above example, the denominator F3(t) = 1 + t
2 never takes the value 0 when t
ranges over A, but consider the following curve in A
2
:
G(t) = a0 +
t
2
t
e1 +
1
t
e2.
Observe that G(0) is undefined. In terms of coordinates, the above curve is given by
x =
t
2
t
= t
y =
1
t
,
so we have y = 1/x. The curve defined above is a hyperbola, and for t close to 0, the point
on the curve goes toward infinity in one of the two asymptotic directions.
858 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
A clean way to handle the situation in which the denominator vanishes is to work in a
projective space. Intuitively, this means viewing a rational curve in A
n as some appropriate
projection of a polynomial curve in A
n+1, back onto A
n
.
Given an affine space E, for any hyperplane H in E and any point a0 not in H, the central
projection (or conic projection, or perspective projection) of center a0 onto H, is the partial
map p defined as follows: For every point x not in the hyperplane passing through a0 and
parallel to H, we define p(x) as the intersection of the line defined by a0 and x with the
hyperplane H; see Figure 26.1.

Figure 26.1: A central projection in A

through a0 onto the yellow hyperplane H. This
central projection is not defined for any points in the peach hyperplane.
For example, we can view G as a rational curve in A
3 given by
G1(t) = a0 + t
2
e1 + e2 + te3.
If we project this curve G1 (in fact, a parabola in A
3
) using the central projection (perspective
projection) of center a0 onto the plane of equation x3 = 1, we get the previous hyperbola;
see Figure 26.2. For t = 0, the point G1(0) = a0 +e2 in A
3
is in the plane of equation x3 = 0,
and its projection is undefined. We can consider that G1(0) = a0 + e2 in A
3
is projected to
infinity in the direction of e2 in the plane x3 = 0. In the setting of projective spaces, this
direction corresponds rigorously to a point at infinity; see Figure 26.2.
Let us verify that the central projection used in the previous example has the desired
effect. Let us assume that E has dimension n + 1 and that (a0,(e1, . . . , en+1)) is an affine

frame for E. We want to determine the coordinates of the central projection p(x) of a point
x ∈ E onto the hyperplane H of equation xn+1 = 1 (the center of projection being a0). If
x = a0 + x1e1 + · · · + xnen + xn+1en+1,
assuming that xn+1 6 = 0; a point on the line passing through a0 and x has coordinates of
the form (λx1, . . . , λxn+1); and p(x), the central projection of x onto the hyperplane H of
equation xn+1 = 1, is the intersection of the line from a0 to x and this hyperplane H. Thus
we must have λxn+1 = 1, and the coordinates of p(x) are

x1

, . . . ,
xn

 .
Note that p(x) is undefined when xn+1 = 0. In projective spaces, we can make sense of such
points.
The above calculation confirms that G(t) is a central projection of G1(t). Similarly, if we
define the curve F1 in A
3 by
F1(t) = a0 + (1 − t
2
)e1 + 2te2 + (1 + t

What we just sketched is a general method to deal with rational curves. We can use our
“hat construction” to embed an affine space E into a vector space b E having one more dimen￾sion, then construct the projective space P
￾ Eb
 . This turns out to be the “projective com￾pletion” of the affine space E. Then we can define a rational curve in P
￾ Eb
 , basically as the
central projection of a polynomial curve in b E back onto P
￾ Eb
 . The same approach can be used
to deal with rational surfaces. Due to the lack of space, such a presentation is omitted. How￾ever, it can be found on the web; see http://www.cis.upenn.edu/e jean/gbooks/geom2.html.
More generally, the projective completion of an affine space is a very convenient tool to
handle “points at infinity” in a clean fashion.
This chapter contains a brief presentation of concepts of projective geometry. The follow￾ing concepts are presented: projective spaces, projective frames, homogeneous coordinates,
projective maps, projective hyperplanes, multiprojective maps, affine patches. The projec￾tive completion of an affine space is presented using the “hat construction.” The theorems
of Pappus and Desargues are proved, using the method in which points are “sent to infinity.”
We also discuss the cross-ratio and duality. The chapter ends with a very brief explanation of
the use of the complexification of a projective space in order to define the notion of angle and
orthogonality in a projective setting. We also include a short section on applications of pro￾jective geometry, notably to computer vision (camera calibration), efficient communication,
and error-correcting codes.
26.2 Projective Spaces
As in the case of affine geometry, our presentation of projective geometry is rather sketchy.
For a systematic treatment of projective geometry, we recommend Berger [11, 12], Samuel
[142], Pedoe [136], Coxeter [45, 46, 43, 44], Beutelspacher and Rosenbaum [22], Fresnel [65],
Sidler [161], Tisseron [175], Lehmann and Bkouche [115], Vienne [185], and the classical
treatise by Veblen and Young [183, 184], which, although slightly old-fashioned, is definitely
worth reading. Emil Artin’s famous book [6] contains, among other things, an axiomatic
presentation of projective geometry, and a wealth of geometric material presented from an
algebraic point of view. Other “oldies but goodies” include the beautiful books by Darboux
[47] and Klein [103]. For a development of projective geometry addressing the delicate prob￾lem of orientation, see Stolfi [167], and for an approach geared towards computer graphics,
see Penna and Patterson [137].
First, we define projective spaces, allowing the field K to be arbitrary (which does no
harm, and is needed to allow finite and complex projective spaces). Roughly speaking, every
projective concept is a linear–algebraic concept “up to a scalar.” For spaces, this is made
precise as follows.
Definition 26.1. Given a vector space E over a field K, the projective space P(E) induced
by E is the set (E − {0})/ ∼ of equivalence classes of nonzero vectors in E under the
26.2. PROJECTIVE SPACES 861
equivalence relation ∼ defined such that for all u, v ∈ E − {0},
u ∼ v iff v = λu, for some λ ∈ K − {0}.
The canonical projection p: (E − {0}) → P(E) is the function associating the equivalence
class [u]∼ modulo ∼ to u 6 = 0. The dimension dim(P(E)) of P(E) is defined as follows:
If E is of infinite dimension, then dim(P(E)) = dim(E), and if E has finite dimension,
dim(E) = n ≥ 1 then dim(P(E)) = n − 1.
Mathematically, a projective space P(E) is a set of equivalence classes of vectors in
E. The spirit of projective geometry is to view an equivalence class p(u) = [u]∼ as an
“atomic” object, forgetting the internal structure of the equivalence class. For this reason,
it is customary to call an equivalence class a = [u]∼ a point (the entire equivalence class [u]∼
is collapsed into a single object viewed as a point).
Remarks:
(1) If we view E as an affine space, then for any nonnull vector u ∈ E, since
[u]∼ = {λu | λ ∈ K, λ 6 = 0},
letting
Ku = {λu | λ ∈ K}
denote the subspace of dimension 1 spanned by u, the map
[u]∼ 7→ Ku
from P(E) to the set of one-dimensional subspaces of E is clearly a bijection, and
since subspaces of dimension 1 correspond to lines through the origin in E, we can
view P(E) as the set of lines in E passing through the origin. So, the projective space
P(E) can be viewed as the set obtained from E when lines through the origin are
treated as points.
However, this is a somewhat deceptive view. Indeed, depending on the structure of
the vector space E, a line (through the origin) in E may be a fairly complex object,
and treating a line just as a point is really a mental game. For example, E may be the
vector space of real homogeneous polynomials P(x, y, z) of degree 2 in three variables
x, y, z (plus the null polynomial), and a “line” (through the origin) in E corresponds to
an algebraic curve of degree 2. Lots of details need to be filled in, but roughly speaking,
the curve defined by P is the “zero locus of P,” i.e., the set of points (x, y, z) ∈ P(R
3
)
(or perhaps in P(C
3
)) for which P(x, y, z) = 0. We will come back to this point in
Section 26.4 after having introduced homogeneous coordinates.
More generally, E may be a vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree m
in 3 or more variables (plus the null polynomial), and the lines in E correspond to
862 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
such objects as algebraic curves, algebraic surfaces, and algebraic varieties. The point
of view where a complex object such as a curve or a surface is treated as a point
in a (projective) space is actually very fruitful and is one of the themes of algebraic
geometry (see Fulton [66] or Harris [87]).
(2) When dim(E) = 1, we have dim(P(E)) = 0. When E = {0}, we have P(E) = ∅. By
convention, we give it the dimension −1.
We denote the projective space P(Kn+1) by P
n
K. When K = R, we also denote P
n
R by
RPn
, and when K = C, we denote P
n
C by CPn
. The projective space P
0
K is a (projective)
point. The projective space P
1
K is called a projective line. The projective space P
2
K is called
a projective plane.
The projective space P(E) can be visualized in the following way. For simplicity, assume
that E = R
n+1, and thus P(E) = RPn
(the same reasoning applies to E = Kn+1, where K
is any field).
Let H be the affine hyperplane consisting of all points (x1, . . . , xn+1) such that xn+1 = 1.
Every nonzero vector u in E determines a line D passing through the origin, and this line
intersects the hyperplane H in a unique point a, unless D is parallel to H. When D is
parallel to H, the line corresponding to the equivalence class of u can be thought of as a
point at infinity, often denoted by u∞. Thus, the projective space P(E) can be viewed as
the set of points in the hyperplane H, together with points at infinity associated with lines
in the hyperplane H∞ of equation xn+1 = 0. We will come back to this point of view when
we consider the projective completion of an affine space. Figure 26.3 illustrates the above
representation of the projective space for E = R
2 and E = R

26.2. PROJECTIVE SPACES 863
We refer to the above model of P(E) as the hyperplane model. In this model some
hyperplane H∞ (through the origin) in R
n+1 is singled out, and the points of P(E) arising
from the hyperplane H∞ are declared to be “points at infinity.” The purpose of the affine
hyperplane H parallel to H∞ and distinct from H∞ is to get images for the other points
in P(E) (i.e., those that arise from lines not contained in H∞). It should be noted that
the choice of which points should be considered as infinite is relative to the choice of H∞.
Viewing certain points of P(E) as points at infinity is convenient for getting a mental picture
of P(E), but there is nothing intrinsic about that. Points of P(E) are all equal, and unless
some additional structure in introduced in P(E) (such as a hyperplane), a point in P(E)
doesn’t know whether it is infinite! The notion of point at infinity is really an affine notion.
This point will be made precise in Section 26.8.
Again, for RPn = P(R
n+1), instead of considering the hyperplane H, we can consider the
n-sphere S
n of center 0 and radius 1, i.e., the set of points (x1, . . . , xn+1) such that
x
2
1 + · · · + x
2
n + x
2
n+1 = 1.
In this case, every line D through the center of the sphere intersects the sphere S
n
in two
antipodal points a+ and a−. The projective space RPn
is the quotient space obtained from
the sphere S
n by identifying antipodal points a+ and a−. It is hard to visualize such an
object! We call this model of P(E) the spherical model. See Figure 26.4.

A more subtle construction consists in considering the (upper) half-sphere instead of the
sphere, where the upper half-sphere S+
n
is set of points on the sphere S
n
such that xn+1 ≥ 0.
This time, every line through the center intersects the (upper) half-sphere in a single point,
except on the boundary of the half-sphere, where it intersects in two antipodal points a+
and a−. Thus, the projective space RPn
is the quotient space obtained from the (upper)
864 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
half-sphere S+
n by identifying antipodal points a+ and a− on the boundary of the half-sphere.
We call this model of P(E) the half-spherical model; see Figure 26.5.

When n = 2, we get a circle. When n = 3, the upper half-sphere is homeomorphic
to a closed disk (say, by orthogonal projection onto the xy-plane), and RP2
is in bijection
with a closed disk in which antipodal points on its boundary (a unit circle) have been
identified. This is hard to visualize! In this model of the real projective space, projective
lines are great semicircles on the upper half-sphere, with antipodal points on the boundary
identified. Boundary points correspond to points at infinity. By orthogonal projection,
these great semicircles correspond to semiellipses, with antipodal points on the boundary
identified. Traveling along such a projective “line,” when we reach a boundary point, we
“wrap around”! In general, the upper half-sphere S+
n
is homeomorphic to the closed unit
ball in R
n
, whose boundary is the (n − 1)-sphere S
n−1
. For example, the projective space
RP3
is in bijection with the closed unit ball in R
3
, with antipodal points on its boundary
(the sphere S
2
) identified!
Remarks:
(1) A projective space P(E) has been defined as a set without any topological structure.
When the field K is either the field R of reals or the field C of complex numbers, the
vector space E is a topological space. Thus, the projection map p: (E − {0}) → P(E)
induces a topology on the projective space P(E), namely the quotient topology. This
means that a subset V of P(E) is open iff p
−1
(V ) is an open set in E. Then, for
example, it turns out that the real projective space RPn
is homeomorphic to the space
26.3. PROJECTIVE SUBSPACES 865
obtained by taking the quotient of the (upper) half-sphere S+
n
, by the equivalence
relation identifying antipodal points a+ and a− on the boundary of the half-sphere.
Another interesting fact is that the complex projective line CP1 = P(C
2
) is homeomor￾phic to the (real) 2-sphere S
2
, and that the real projective space RP3
is homeomorphic
to the group of rotations SO(3) of R
3
.
(2) If H is a hyperplane in E, recall from Proposition 11.7 that there is some nonnull linear
form f ∈ E
∗
such that H = Ker f. Also, given any nonnull linear form f ∈ E
∗
, its
kernel H = Ker f = f
−1
(0) is a hyperplane, and if Ker f = Ker g = H, then g = λf
for some λ 6 = 0. These facts can be concisely stated by saying that the map
[f]∼ 7→ Ker f
mapping the equivalence class [f]∼ = {λf | λ 6 = 0} of a nonnull linear form f ∈ E
∗
to the hyperplane H = Ker f in E is a bijection between the projective space P(E
∗
)
and the set of hyperplanes in E. When E is of finite dimension, this bijection yields a
useful duality, which will be investigated in Section 26.12.
We now define projective subspaces.
26.3 Projective Subspaces
Projective subspaces of a projective space P(E) are induced by subspaces of the vector space
E.
Definition 26.2. Given a nontrivial vector space E, a projective subspace (or linear projec￾tive variety) of P(E) is any subset W of P(E) such that there is some subspace V 6 = {0}
of E with W = p(V − {0}). The dimension dim(W) of W is defined as follows: If V is of
infinite dimension, then dim(W) = dim(V ), and if dim(V ) = p ≥ 1, then dim(W) = p − 1.
We say that a family (ai)i∈I of points of P(E) is projectively independent if there is a linearly
independent family (ui)i∈I in E such that ai = p(ui) for every i ∈ I.
Remark: If we allow the empty subset to be a projective subspace, then if assign the empty
subset to the trivial subspace {0}, we obtain a bijection between the subspaces of E and the
projective subspaces of P(E). If P(V ) is the projective space induced by the vector space
V , we also denote p(V − {0}) by P(V ), or even by p(V ), even though p(0) is undefined.
A projective subspace of dimension 0 is a called a (projective) point. A projective sub￾space of dimension 1 is called a (projective) line, and a projective subspace of dimension 2
is called a (projective) plane. If H is a hyperplane in E, then P(H) is called a projective
hyperplane. It is easily verified that any arbitrary intersection of projective subspaces is a
projective subspace.
866 CHAPTER 26. BASICS OF PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY
A single point is projectively independent. Two points a, b are projectively independent
if a 6 = b. Two distinct points define a (unique) projective line. Three points a, b, c are
projectively independent if they are distinct, and neither belongs to the projective line defined
by the other two. Three projectively independent points define a (unique) projective plane.
A closer look at projective subspaces will show some of the advantages of projective
geometry: In considering intersection properties, there are no exceptions due to parallelism,
as in affine spaces.
Let E be a nontrivial vector space. Given any nontrivial subset S of E, the subset
S defines a subset U = p(S − {0}) of the projective space P(E), and if h Si denotes the
subspace of E spanned by S, it is immediately verified that P(h Si ) is the intersection of all
projective subspaces containing U, and this projective subspace is denoted by h Ui . Then
n ≥ 2 point a1, . . . , an ∈ P(E) are projectively independent iff for all i = 1, . . . , n the
point ai does not belong to the projective subspace h a1, . . . , ai−1, ai+1, . . . , ani spanned by
{a1, . . . , ai−1, ai+1, . . . , an}.
Given any subspaces M and N of E, recall from Proposition 24.15 that we have the
Grassmann relation
dim(M) + dim(N) = dim(M + N) + dim (M ∩ N).
Then the following proposition is easily shown.
Proposition 26.1. Given a projective space P(E), for any two projective subspaces U, V of
P(E), we have
dim(U) + dim(V ) = dim(h U ∪ V i ) + dim (U ∩ V ).
Furthermore, if dim(U)+dim(V ) ≥ dim(P(E)), then U∩V is nonempty and if dim(P(E)) =
n, then:
(i) The intersection of any n hyperplanes is nonempty.
(ii) For every hyperplane H and every point a /∈ H, every line D containing a intersects
H in a unique point.
(iii) In a projective plane, every two distinct lines intersect in a unique point.
As a corollary, in 3D projective space (dim(P(E)) = 3), for every plane H, every line not
contained in H intersects H in a unique point.
It is often useful to deal with projective hyperplanes in terms of nonnull linear forms and
equations. Recall that the map
[f]∼ 7→ Ker f
26.3. PROJECTIVE SUBSPACES 867
is a bijection between P(E
∗
) and the set of hyperplanes in E, mapping the equivalence
class [f]∼ = {λf | λ 6 = 0} of a nonnull linear form f ∈ E
∗
to the hyperplane H = Ker f.
Furthermore, if u ∼ v, which means that u = λv for some λ 6 = 0, we have
f(u) = 0 iff f(v) = 0,
since f(v) = λf(u) and λ 6 = 0. Thus, there is a bijection
{λf | λ 6 = 0} 7→ P(Ker f)
mapping points in P(E
∗
) to hyperplanes in P(E). Any nonnull linear form f associated
with some hyperplane P(H) in the above bijection (i.e., H = Ker f) is called an equation of
the projective hyperplane P(H). We also say that f = 0 is the equation of the hyperplane
P(H).
Before ending this section, we give an example of a projective space where lines have a
nontrivial geometric interpretation, namely as “pencils of lines.” If E = R
3
, recall that the
dual space E
∗
is the set of all linear maps f : R
