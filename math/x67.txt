Recall that E
￾ 1,
−→f
 denotes the eigenspace of the linear map −→f associated with the scalar
1, that is, the subspace consisting of all vectors u ∈
−→E such that
−→f (u) = u. Clearly,
Ker ￾
−→f − id = E
￾ 1,
−→f
 . Given some origin Ω ∈ E, since
f(a) = f(Ω + −→Ωa) = f(Ω) + −→f (
−→Ωa),
we have
−−−−−−→
f(Ω)f(a) = −→f (
−→Ωa), and thus
−−−→
Ωf(a) =
−−−−→
Ωf(Ω) + −→f (
−→Ωa).
From the above, we get
−−−→
Ωf(a) −
−→Ωa =
−−−−→
Ωf(Ω) + −→f (
−→Ωa) −
−→Ωa.
Using this, we show the following lemma, which holds for arbitrary affine spaces of finite
dimension and for arbitrary affine maps.
970 CHAPTER 27. THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM ´
Proposition 27.8. Let E be any affine space of finite dimension. For every affine map
f : E → E, let Fix(f) = {a ∈ E | f(a) = a} be the set of fixed points of f. The following
properties hold:
(1) If f has some fixed point a, so that Fix(f) 6 = ∅, then Fix(f) is an affine subspace of E
such that
Fix(f) = a + E
￾ 1,
−→f
 = a + Ker ￾
−→f − id ,
where E
￾ 1,
−→f
 is the eigenspace of the linear map −→f for the eigenvalue 1.
(2) The affine map f has a unique fixed point iff E
￾ 1,
−→f
 = Ker ￾
−→f − id = {0}.
Proof. (1) Since the identity
−−−→
Ωf(b) −
−→Ωb =
−−−−→
Ωf(Ω) + −→f (
−→Ωb) −
−→Ωb
holds for all Ω, b ∈ E, if f(a) = a, then
−−−→
af(a) = 0, and thus, letting Ω = a, for any b ∈ E
we have −−−→
af(b) −
−→ab =
−−−→
af(a) + −→f (
−→ab) −
−→ab =
−→f (
−→ab) −
−→ab,
and so
f(b) = b
iff −−−→
af(b) −
−→ab = 0
iff
−→f (
−→ab) −
−→ab = 0
iff
−→ab ∈ E
￾ 1,
−→f
 = Ker ￾
−→f − id ,
which proves that
Fix(f) = a + E
￾ 1,
−→f
 = a + Ker ￾
−→f − id .
(2) Again, fix some origin Ω. Some a satisfies f(a) = a iff
−−−→
Ωf(a) −
−→Ωa = 0
iff −−−−→
Ωf(Ω) + −→f (
−→Ωa) −
−→Ωa = 0,
which can be rewritten as
￾ −→f − id (
−→Ωa) = −
−−−−→
Ωf(Ω).
We have E
￾ 1,
−→f
 = Ker ￾
−→f − id = {0} iff −→f − id is injective, and since −→E has finite
dimension,
−→f − id is also surjective, and thus, there is indeed some a ∈ E such that
￾
−→f − id (
−→Ωa) = −
−−−−→
Ωf(Ω),
27.4. AFFINE ISOMETRIES AND FIXED POINTS 971
and it is unique, since
−→f − id is injective. Conversely, if f has a unique fixed point, say a,
from
￾ −→f − id (
−→Ωa) = −
−−−−→
Ωf(Ω),
we have ￾
−→f − id (
−→Ωa) = 0 iff f(Ω) = Ω, and since a is the unique fixed point of f, we must
have a = Ω, which shows that −→f − id is injective.
Remark: The fact that E has finite dimension is used only to prove (2), and (1) holds in
general.
If an affine isometry f leaves some point fixed, we can take such a point Ω as the
origin, and then f(Ω) = Ω and we can view f as a rotation or an improper orthogonal
transformation, depending on the nature of −→f . Note that it is quite possible that Fix(f) = ∅.
For example, nontrivial translations have no fixed points. A more interesting example is
provided by the composition of a plane reflection about a line composed with a a nontrivial
translation parallel to this line.
Otherwise, we will see in Theorem 27.10 that every affine isometry is the (commutative)
composition of a translation with an affine isometry that always has a fixed point.
27.4 Affine Isometries and Fixed Points
Let E be an affine space. Given any two affine subspaces F, G, if F and G are orthogonal
complements in E, which means that −→F and −→G are orthogonal subspaces of −→E such that
−→E =
−→F ⊕
−→G, for any point Ω ∈ F, we define q : E →
−→G such that
q(a) = p−→G
(
−→Ωa).
Note that q(a) is independent of the choice of Ω ∈ F, since we have
−→Ωa = p−→F
(
−→Ωa) + p−→G
(
−→Ωa),
and for any Ω1 ∈ F, we have
−−→Ω1a =
−−→Ω1Ω + p−→F
(
−→Ωa) + p−→G
(
−→Ωa),
and since −−→Ω1Ω ∈
−→F , this shows that
p−→G
(
−−→Ω1a) = p−→G
(
−→Ωa).
Then the map g : E → E such that g(a) = a − 2q(a), or equivalently
−−−→
ag(a) = −2q(a) = −2p−→G
(
−→Ωa),
972 CHAPTER 27. THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM ´
does not depend on the choice of Ω ∈ F. If we identify E to
−→E by choosing any origin Ω
in F, we note that g is identified with the symmetry with respect to −→F and parallel to −→G.
Thus, the map g is an affine isometry, and it is called the affine orthogonal symmetry about
F. Since
g(a) = Ω + −→Ωa − 2p−→G
(
−→Ωa)
for all Ω ∈ F and for all a ∈ E, we note that the linear map −→g associated with g is
the (linear) symmetry about the subspace −→F (the direction of F), and parallel to −→G (the
direction of G).
Remark: The map p: E → F such that p(a) = a − q(a), or equivalently
−−→
ap(a) = −q(a) = −p−→G
(
−→Ωa),
is also independent of Ω ∈ F, and it is called the affine orthogonal projection onto F.
The following amusing lemma shows the extra power afforded by affine orthogonal sym￾metries: Translations are subsumed! Given two parallel affine subspaces F1 and F2 in E,
letting −→F be the common direction of F1 and F2 and −→G =
−→F
⊥ be its orthogonal comple￾ment, for any a ∈ F1, the affine subspace a +
−→G intersects F2 in a single point b (see Lemma
24.16). We define the distance between F1 and F2 as k
−→abk . It is easily seen that the distance
between F1 and F2 is independent of the choice of a in F1, and that it is the minimum of
k
−→xyk for all x ∈ F1 and all y ∈ F2.
Proposition 27.9. Given any affine space E, if f : E → E and g : E → E are affine
orthogonal symmetries about parallel affine subspaces F1 and F2, then g ◦ f is a translation
defined by the vector 2
−→ab, where
−→ab is any vector perpendicular to the common direction −→F
of F1 and F2 such that k
−→abk is the distance between F1 and F2, with a ∈ F1 and b ∈ F2.
Conversely, every translation by a vector τ is obtained as the composition of two affine
orthogonal symmetries about parallel affine subspaces F1 and F2 whose common direction is
orthogonal to τ =
−→ab, for some a ∈ F1 and some b ∈ F2 such that the distance between F1
and F2 is k
−→abk /2.
Proof. We observed earlier that the linear maps
−→f and −→g associated with f and g are the
linear reflections about the directions of F1 and F2. However, F1 and F2 have the same
direction, and so
−→f =
−→g . Since −−→
g ◦ f =
−→g ◦
−→f and since
−→f ◦
−→g =
−→f ◦
−→f = id, because
every reflection is an involution, we have −−→
g ◦ f = id, proving that g ◦ f is a translation. If
we pick a ∈ F1, then g ◦ f(a) = g(a), the affine reflection of a ∈ F1 about F2, and it is
easily checked that g ◦ f is the translation by the vector τ =
−−−→
ag(a) whose norm is twice the
distance between F1 and F2. The second part of the lemma is left as an easy exercise.
27.4. AFFINE ISOMETRIES AND FIXED POINTS 973
We conclude our quick study of affine isometries by proving a result that plays a major
role in characterizing the affine isometries. This result may be viewed as a generalization of
Chasles’s theorem about the direct rigid motions in E
3
.
Theorem 27.10. Let E be a Euclidean affine space of finite dimension n. For every affine
isometry f : E → E, there is a unique affine isometry g : E → E and a unique translation
t = tτ , with
−→f (τ ) = τ (i.e., τ ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id ), such that the set Fix(g) = {a ∈ E | g(a) =
a} of fixed points of g is a nonempty affine subspace of E of direction
−→G = Ker ￾
−→f − id = E
￾ 1,
−→f
 ,
and such that
f = t ◦ g and t ◦ g = g ◦ t.
Furthermore, we have the following additional properties:
(a) f = g and τ = 0 iff f has some fixed point, i.e., iff Fix(f) 6 = ∅.
(b) If f has no fixed points, i.e., Fix(f) = ∅, then dim￾ Ker ￾
−→f − id ≥ 1.
Proof. The proof rests on the following two key facts:
(1) If we can find some x ∈ E such that
−−−→
xf(x) = τ belongs to Ker ￾
−→f − id , we get the
existence of g and τ .
(2) −→E = Ker ￾
−→f − id ⊕ Im ￾
−→f − id , and the spaces Ker ￾
−→f − id and
Im ￾
−→f − id are orthogonal. This implies the uniqueness of g and τ .
First, we prove that for every isometry h:
−→E →
−→E , Ker (h − id) and Im (h − id) are orthog￾onal and that
−→E = Ker (h − id) ⊕ Im (h − id).
Recall that
dim￾ −→E
 = dim(Ker ϕ) + dim(Im ϕ),
for any linear map ϕ:
−→E →
−→E ; see Theorem 6.16. To show that we have a direct sum, we
prove orthogonality. Let u ∈ Ker (h − id), so that h(u) = u, let v ∈
−→E , and compute
u · (h(v) − v) = u · h(v) − u · v = h(u) · h(v) − u · v = 0,
since h(u) = u and h is an isometry.
Next, assume that there is some x ∈ E such that
−−−→
xf(x) = τ belongs to the space
Ker ￾
−→f − id . If we define g : E → E such that
g = t(−τ) ◦ f,
974 CHAPTER 27. THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM ´
we have
g(x) = f(x) − τ = x,
since
−−−→
xf(x) = τ is equivalent to x = f(x) − τ . As a composition of affine isometries, g is an
affine isometry, x is a fixed point of g, and since τ ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id , we have
−→f (τ ) = τ,
and since
g(b) = f(b) − τ
for all b ∈ E, we have −→g =
−→f . Since g has some fixed point x, by Lemma 27.8, Fix(g)
is an affine subspace of E with direction Ker ￾ −→g − id = Ker ￾
−→f − id . We also have
f(b) = g(b) + τ for all b ∈ E, and thus
(g ◦ tτ )(b) = g(b + τ ) = g(b) + −→g (τ ) = g(b) + −→f (τ ) = g(b) + τ = f(b),
and
(tτ ◦ g)(b) = g(b) + τ = f(b),
which proves that t ◦ g = g ◦ t.
To prove the existence of x as above, pick any arbitrary point a ∈ E. Since
−→E = Ker ￾
−→f − id ⊕ Im ￾
−→f − id ,
there is a unique vector τ ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id and some v ∈
−→E such that
−−−→
af(a) = τ +
−→f (v) − v.
For any x ∈ E, since we also have
−−−→
xf(x) = −→xa +
−−−→
af(a) + −−−−−→
f(a)f(x) = −→xa +
−−−→
af(a) + −→f (
−→ax),
we get
−−−→
xf(x) = −→xa + τ +
−→f (v) − v +
−→f (
−→ax),
which can be rewritten as
−−−→
xf(x) = τ +
￾
−→f − id (v +
−→ax).
If we let −→ax = −v, that is, x = a − v, we get
−−−→
xf(x) = τ,
with τ ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id .
27.4. AFFINE ISOMETRIES AND FIXED POINTS 975
Finally, we show that τ is unique. Assume two decompositions (g1, τ1) and (g2, τ2). Since
−→f =
−→g1 , we have Ker (−→g1 − id) = Ker ￾ −→f − id . Since g1 has some fixed point b, we get
f(b) = g1(b) + τ1 = b + τ1,
that is,
−−−→
bf(b) = τ1, and
−−−→
bf(b) ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id , since τ1 ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id . Similarly, for some
fixed point c of g2, we get
−−−→
cf(c) = τ2 and
−−−→
cf(c) ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id . Then we have
τ2 − τ1 =
−−−→
cf(c) −
−−−→
bf(b) = −→cb −
−−−−−→
f(c)f(b) = −→cb −
−→f (
−→cb),
which shows that
τ2 − τ1 ∈ Ker ￾
−→f − id ∩ Im ￾
−→f − id ,
and thus that τ2 = τ1, since we have shown that
−→E = Ker ￾
−→f − id ⊕ Im ￾
−→f − id .
The fact that (a) holds is a consequence of the uniqueness of g and τ , since f and 0
clearly satisfy the required conditions. That (b) holds follows from Lemma 27.8 (2), since
the affine map f has a unique fixed point iff E
￾ 1,
−→f
 = Ker ￾
−→f − id = {0}.

(1) Note that Ker ￾
−→f − id = {0} iff Fix(g) consists of a single element, which is the
unique fixed point of f. However, even if f is not a translation, f may not have any
fixed points. For example, this happens when E is the affine Euclidean plane and f
is the composition of a reflection about a line composed with a nontrivial translation
parallel to this line.
(2) The fact that E has finite dimension is used only to prove (b).
(3) It is easily checked that Fix(g) consists of the set of points x such that k
−−−→
xf(x)k is
minimal.
In the affine Euclidean plane it is easy to see that the affine isometries (besides the
identity) are classified as follows. An affine isometry f that has a fixed point is a rotation if
it is a direct isometry; otherwise, it is an affine reflection about a line. If f has no fixed point,
then it is either a nontrivial translation or the composition of an affine reflection about a
line with a nontrivial translation parallel to this line.
In an affine space of dimension 3 it is easy to see that the affine isometries (besides the
identity) are classified as follows. There are three kinds of affine isometries that have a fixed
point. A proper affine isometry with a fixed point is a rotation around a line D (its set of
fixed points), as illustrated in Figure 27.9.

a
f (a)
Figure 27.9: 3D proper affine rigid motion with line D of fixed points (rotation).
An improper affine isometry with a fixed point is either an affine reflection about a plane
H (the set of fixed points) or the composition of a rotation followed by an affine reflection
about a plane H orthogonal to the axis of rotation D, as illustrated in Figures 27.10 and
27.11. In the second case, there is a single fixed point O = D ∩ H.
There are three types of affine isometries with no fixed point. The first kind is a non￾trivial translation. The second kind is the composition of a rotation followed by a nontrivial
translation parallel to the axis of rotation D. Such an affine rigid motion is proper, and is
called a screw motion. A screw motion is illustrated in Figure 27.12.

The third kind is the composition of an affine reflection about a plane followed by a

illustrated in Figure 27.13.
This last transformation is an improper affine isometry.
27.5 The Cartan–Dieudonn´e Theorem for Affine
Isometries
The Cartan–Dieudonn´e theorem also holds for affine isometries, with a small twist due to
translations. The reader is referred to Berger [11], Snapper and Troyer [162], or Tisseron
[175] for a detailed treatment of the Cartan–Dieudonn´e theorem and its variants.
Theorem 27.11. Let E be an affine Euclidean space of dimension n ≥ 1. Every affine
isometry f ∈ Is(E) that has a fixed point and is not the identity is the composition of at
most n affine reflections. Every affine isometry f ∈ Is(E) that has no fixed point is the

27.5. THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM FOR AFFINE ISOMETRIES ´ 979
composition of at most n + 2 affine reflections. When n ≥ 2, the identity is the composition
of any reflection with itself.
Proof. First, we use Theorem 27.10. If f has a fixed point Ω, we choose Ω as an origin
and work in the vector space EΩ. Since f behaves as a linear isometry, the result follows
from Theorem 27.1. More specifically, we can write −→f =
−→sk ◦ · · · ◦ −→s1 for k ≤ n hyperplane
reflections −→si
. We define the affine reflections si such that
si(a) = Ω + −→si(
−→Ωa)
for all a ∈ E, and we note that f = sk ◦ · · · ◦ s1, since
f(a) = Ω + −→sk ◦ · · · ◦ −→s1 (
−→Ωa)
for all a ∈ E. If f has no fixed point, then f = t ◦ g for some affine isometry g that has a
fixed point Ω and some translation t = tτ , with
−→f (τ ) = τ . By the argument just given, we
can write g = sk ◦ · · · ◦ s1 for some affine reflections (at most n). However, by Lemma 27.9,
the translation t = tτ can be achieved by two affine reflections about parallel hyperplanes,
and thus f = sk+2 ◦ · · · ◦ s1, for some affine reflections (at most n + 2).
When n ≥ 3, we can also characterize the affine isometries in SE(n) in terms of affine
flips. Remarkably, not only we can do without translations, but we can even bound the
number of affine flips by n.
Theorem 27.12. Let E be a Euclidean affine space of dimension n ≥ 3. Every affine rigid
motion f ∈ SE(E) is the composition of an even number of affine flips f = f2k ◦ · · · ◦ f1,
where 2k ≤ n.
Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 27.11, we distinguish between the two cases where f has
some fixed point or not. If f has a fixed point Ω, we apply Theorem 27.5. More specifically,
we can write
−→f =
−→f2k ◦ · · · ◦
−→f1 for some flips −→fi
. We define the affine flips fi such that
fi(a) = Ω + −→fi(
−→Ωa)
for all a ∈ E, and we note that f = f2k ◦ · · · ◦ f1, since
f(a) = Ω + −→f2k ◦ · · · ◦
−→f1 (
−→Ωa)
for all a ∈ E.
If f does not have a fixed point, as in the proof of Theorem 27.11, we get
f = tτ ◦ f2k ◦ · · · ◦ f1,
for some affine flips fi
. We need to get rid of the translation. However, −→f (τ ) = τ , and by
the second part of Theorem 27.5, we can assume that τ ∈
−→F2k
⊥, where −→F2k is the direction
980 CHAPTER 27. THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM ´
of the affine subspace defining the affine flip f2k. Finally, appealing to Lemma 27.9, since
τ ∈
−→F2k
⊥, the translation tτ can be expressed as the composition f2
0k
◦f2
0k−1
of two affine flips
f2
0k−1
and f2
0k
about the two parallel subspaces Ω + −→F2k and Ω + τ/2 +
−→F2k, whose distance
is k τk /2. However, since f2
0k−1
and f2k are both the identity on Ω + −→F2k, we must have
f2
0k−1 = f2k, and thus
f = tτ ◦ f2k ◦ f2k−1 ◦ · · · ◦ f1
= f2
0k ◦ f2
0k−1 ◦ f2k ◦ f2k−1 ◦ · · · ◦ f1
= f2
0k ◦ f2k−1 ◦ · · · ◦ f1,
since f2
0k−1 = f2k and f2
0k−1
◦ f2k = f2k ◦ f2k = id, since f2k is an affine symmetry.
Remark: It is easy to prove that if f is a screw motion in SE(3), D its axis, θ is its angle
of rotation, and τ the translation along the direction of D, then f is the composition of two
affine flips about lines D1 and D2 orthogonal to D, at a distance k τk /2 and making an angle
θ/2.
Chapter 28
Isometries of Hermitian Spaces
28.1 The Cartan–Dieudonn´e Theorem,
Hermitian Case
The Cartan-Dieudonn´e theorem can be generalized (Theorem 28.2), but this requires al￾lowing new types of hyperplane reflections that we call Hermitian reflections. After doing
so, every isometry in U(n) can always be written as a composition of at most n Hermi￾tian reflections (for n ≥ 2). Better yet, every rotation in SU(n) can be expressed as the
composition of at most 2n − 2 (standard) hyperplane reflections! This implies that every
unitary transformation in U(n) is the composition of at most 2n−1 isometries, with at most
one Hermitian reflection, the other isometries being (standard) hyperplane reflections. The
crucial Proposition 13.2 is false as is, and needs to be amended. The QR-decomposition of
arbitrary complex matrices in terms of Householder matrices can also be generalized, using
a trick.
In order to generalize the Cartan–Dieudonn´e theorem and the QR-decomposition in terms
of Householder transformations, we need to introduce new kinds of hyperplane reflections.
This is not really surprising, since in the Hermitian case, there are improper isometries
whose determinant can be any unit complex number. Hyperplane reflections are generalized
as follows.
Definition 28.1. Let E be a Hermitian space of finite dimension. For any hyperplane H,
for any nonnull vector w orthogonal to H, so that E = H ⊕ G, where G = Cw, a Hermitian
reflection about H of angle θ is a linear map of the form ρH, θ : E → E, defined such that
ρH, θ(u) = pH(u) + e
iθpG(u),
for any unit complex number e
iθ 6 = 1 (i.e. θ 6 = k2π). For any nonzero vector w ∈ E, we
denote by ρw,θ the Hermitian reflection given by ρH,θ, where H is the hyperplane orthogonal

Since u = pH(u) + pG(u), the Hermitian reflection ρw, θ is also expressed as
ρw, θ(u) = u + (e
iθ − 1)pG(u),
or as
ρw, θ(u) = u + (e

Note that the case of a standard hyperplane reflection is obtained when e
iθ = −1, i.e., θ = π.
We leave as an easy exercise to check that ρw, θ is indeed an isometry, and that the inverse
of ρw, θ is ρw, −θ. If we pick an orthonormal basis (e1, . . . , en) such that (e1, . . . , en−1) is an
orthonormal basis of H, the matrix of ρw, θ is

We now come to the main surprise. Given any two distinct vectors u and v such that
k
using two Hermitian reflections!
uk = k vk , there isn’t always a hyperplane reflection mapping u to v, but this can be done
Proposition 28.1. Let E be any nontrivial Hermitian space.
(1) For any two vectors u, v ∈ E such that u 6 = v and k uk = k vk , if u · v = e
iθ|u · v|, then
the (usual) reflection s about the hyperplane orthogonal to the vector v − e
−iθu is such
that s(u) = e
iθv.
(2) For any nonnull vector v ∈ E, for any unit complex number e
iθ 6 = 1, there is a Hermi￾tian reflection ρv,θ such that
ρv,θ(v) = e
iθv.
As a consequence, for u and v as in (1), we have ρv,−θ ◦ s(u) = v.
Proof. (1) Consider the (usual) reflection about the hyperplane orthogonal to w = v −e
−iθu.
We have
s(u) = u − 2
(u · (v − e
−iθu))
k
v − e
−iθuk

(v − e
−iθu).
We need to compute
−2u · (v − e
−iθu) and (v − e
−iθu) · (v − e
−iθu).
Since u · v = e
iθ|u · v|, we have
e
−iθu · v = |u · v| and e
iθv · u = |u · v|.
Using the above and the fact that k uk = k vk , we get
−2u · (v − e
−iθu) = 2e
iθ k uk
2 − 2u · v,
= 2e
iθ(k uk
2 − |u · v|),

and
(v − e
−iθu) · (v − e
−iθu) = k vk
2 + k uk
2 − e
−iθu · v − e
iθv · u,
= 2(k uk
2 − |u · v|),
and thus,
−2
(u · (v − e
−iθu))
k
(v − e
−iθu)k
2
(v − e
−iθu) = e
iθ(v − e
−iθu).
But then,
s(u) = u + e
iθ(v − e
−iθu) = u + e
iθv − u = e
iθv,
and s(u) = e
iθv, as claimed.
(2) This part is easier. Consider the Hermitian reflection
ρv,θ(u) = u + (e
iθ − 1) (u · v)
k
vk
2
v.
We have
ρv,θ(v) = v + (e
iθ − 1) (v · v)
k
vk
2
v,
= v + (e
iθ − 1)v,
= e
iθv.
Thus, ρv,θ(v) = e
iθv. Since ρv,θ is linear, changing the argument v to e
iθv, we get
ρv,−θ(e
iθv) = v,
and thus, ρv,−θ ◦ s(u) = v.
Remarks:
(1) If we use the vector v + e
−iθu instead of v − e
−iθu, we get s(u) = −e
iθv.
(2) Certain authors, such as Kincaid and Cheney [102] and Ciarlet [41], use the vector
u + e
iθv instead of our vector v + e
−iθu. The effect of this choice is that they also get
s(u) = −e
iθv.
(3) If v = k uk e1, where e1 is a basis vector, u · e1 = a1, where a1 is just the coefficient
of u over the basis vector e1. Then, since u · e1 = e
iθ|a1|, the choice of the plus sign
in the vector k uk e1 + e
−iθu has the effect that the coefficient of this vector over e1 is
k
(we need to divide by the square norm of this vector).
uk + |a1|, and no cancellations takes place, which is preferable for numerical stability
984 CHAPTER 28. ISOMETRIES OF HERMITIAN SPACES
The last part of Proposition 28.1 shows that the Cartan–Dieudonn´e is salvaged, since we
can send u to v by a sequence of two Hermitian reflections when u 6 = v and k uk = k vk , and
since the inverse of a Hermitian reflection is a Hermitian reflection. Actually, because we
are over the complex field, a linear map always have (complex) eigenvalues, and we can get
a slightly improved result.
Theorem 28.2. Let E be a Hermitian space of dimension n ≥ 1. Every isometry f ∈ U(E)
is the composition f = ρn ◦ ρn−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ρ1 of n isometries ρj
, where each ρj
is either the
identity or a Hermitian reflection (possibly a standard hyperplane reflection). When n ≥ 2,
the identity is the composition of any hyperplane reflection with itself.
Proof. We prove by induction on n that there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors
(u1, . . . , un) of f such that
f(uj ) = e
iθjuj
,
where e
iθj
is an eigenvalue associated with uj
, for all j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
When n = 1, every isometry f ∈ U(E) is either the identity or a Hermitian reflection ρθ,
since for any nonnull vector u, we have f(u) = e
iθu for some θ. We let u1 be any nonnull
unit vector.
Let us now consider the case where n ≥ 2. Since C is algebraically closed, the charac￾teristic polynomial det(f − λid) of f has n complex roots which must be the form e
iθ, since
they have absolute value 1. Pick any such eigenvalue e
iθ1
, and pick any eigenvector u1 6 = 0 of
f for e
iθ1 of unit length. If F = Cu1 is the subspace spanned by u1, we have f(F) = F, since
f(u1) = e
iθ1 u1. Since f(F) = F and f is an isometry, it is easy to see that f(F
⊥) ⊆ F
⊥, and
by Proposition 14.13, we have E = F ⊕ F
⊥. Furthermore, it is obvious that the restriction
of f to F
⊥ is unitary. Since dim (F
⊥) = n − 1, we can apply the induction hypothesis to
F
⊥, and we get an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors (u2, . . . , un) for F
⊥ such that
f(uj ) = e
iθjuj
,
where e
iθj
is an eigenvalue associated with uj
, for all j, 2 ≤ j ≤ n Since E = F ⊕ F
⊥
and F = Cu1, the claim is proved. But then, if ρj
is the Hermitian reflection about the
hyperplane Hj orthogonal to uj and of angle θj
, it is obvious that
f = ρθn ◦ · · · ◦ ρθ1
.
When n ≥ 2, we have id = s ◦ s for every reflection s.
Remarks:
(1) Any isometry f ∈ U(n) can be express as f = ρθ◦g, where g ∈ SU(n) is a rotation, and
ρθ is a Hermitian reflection. Indeed, by the above theorem, with respect to the basis
(u1, . . . , un), det(f) = e
i(θ1+···+θn)
, and letting θ = θ1 +· · ·+θn and ρθ be the Hermitian
28.1. THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM, HERMITIAN CASE ´ 985
reflection about the hyperplane orthogonal to u1 and of angle θ, since ρθ ◦ ρ−θ = id,
we have
f = (ρθ ◦ ρ−θ) ◦ f = ρθ ◦ (ρ−θ ◦ f).
Letting g = ρ−θ ◦f, it is obvious that det(g) = 1. As a consequence, there is a bijection
between S
1 × SU(n) and U(n), where S
1
is the unit circle (which corresponds to the
group of complex numbers e
iθ of unit length). In fact, it is a homeomorphism.
(2) We abandoned the style of proof used in theorem 27.1, because in the Hermitian case,
eigenvalues and eigenvectors always exist, and the proof is simpler that way (in the
real case, an isometry may not have any real eigenvalues!). The sacrifice is that the
theorem yields no information on the number of (standard) hyperplane reflections. We
shall rectify this situation shortly.
We will now reveal the beautiful trick (found in Mneimn´e and Testard [127]) that allows
us to prove that every rotation in SU(n) is the composition of at most 2n − 2 (standard)
hyperplane reflections. For what follows, it is more convenient to denote a standard reflection
about the hyperplane H as hu (it is trivial that these do not depend on the choice of u in
H⊥). Then, given any two distinct orthogonal vectors u, v such that k uk = k vk , consider the
composition ρv, −θ ◦ρu, θ. The trick is that this composition can be expressed as two standard
hyperplane reflections! This wonderful fact is proved in the next Proposition.
Proposition 28.3. Let E be a nontrivial Hermitian space. For any two distinct orthogonal
vectors u, v such that k uk = k vk , we have
ρv, −θ ◦ ρu, θ = hv− u ◦ hv− e−iθu = hu+ v ◦ hu+ e
iθv
.
Proof. Since u and v are orthogonal, each one is in the hyperplane orthogonal to the other,
and thus,
ρu, θ(u) = e
iθu,
ρu, θ(v) = v,
ρv, −θ(u) = u,
ρv, −θ(v) = e
−iθv,
hv− u(u) = v,
hv− u(v) = u,
hv− e−iθu(u) = e
iθv,
hv− e−iθu(v) = e
−iθu.
Consequently, using linearity,
ρv, −θ ◦ ρu, θ(u) = e
iθu,
ρv, −θ ◦ ρu, θ(v) = e
−iθv,
hv− u ◦ hv− e−iθu(u) = e
iθu,
hv− u ◦ hv− e−iθu(v) = e
−iθv,
986 CHAPTER 28. ISOMETRIES OF HERMITIAN SPACES
and since both ρv, −θ ◦ρu, θ and hv− u ◦hv− e−iθu are the identity on the orthogonal complement
of {u, v}, they are equal. Since we also have
hu+ v(u) = −v,
hu+ v(v) = −u,
hu+ e
iθv
(u) = −e
iθv,
hu+ e
iθv
(v) = −e
−iθu,
it is immediately verified that
hv− u ◦ hv− e−iθu = hu+ v ◦ hu+ e
iθv
.
We will use Proposition 28.3 as follows.
Proposition 28.4. Let E be a nontrivial Hermitian space, and let (u1, . . . , un) be some
orthonormal basis for E. For any θ1, . . . , θn such that θ1 + · · · + θn = 0, if f ∈ U(n) is the
isometry defined such that
f(uj ) = e
iθjuj
,
for all j, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, then f is a rotation (f ∈ SU(n)), and
f = ρun, θn ◦ · · · ◦ ρu1, θ1
= ρun, −(θ1+···+θn−1) ◦ ρun−1, θ1+···+θn−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ρu2, −θ1 ◦ ρu1, θ1
= hun− un−1 ◦ hun− e

= hun−1+un ◦ hun−1+ e
i(θ1+···+θn−1)un
◦ · · · ◦ hu1+u2 ◦ hu1+ e
iθ1u2
.
Proof. It is obvious from the definitions that
f = ρun, θn ◦ · · · ◦ ρu1, θ1
,
and since the determinant of f is
D(f) = e
iθ1
· · · e
iθn = e
i(θ1+···+θn)
and θ1 + · · · + θn = 0, we have D(f) = e
0 = 1, and f is a rotation. Letting
fk = ρuk, −(θ1+···+θk−1) ◦ ρuk−1, θ1+···+θk−1
◦ · · · ◦ ρu3, −(θ1+θ2) ◦ ρu2, θ1+θ2 ◦ ρu2, −θ1 ◦ ρu1, θ1

we prove by induction on k, 2 ≤ k ≤ n, that
fk(uj ) =

if k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n.
28.1. THE CARTAN–DIEUDONNE THEOREM, HERMITIAN CASE ´ 987
The base case was treated in Proposition 28.3. Now, the proof of Proposition 28.3 also
showed that
ρuk+1, −(θ1+···+θk) ◦ ρuk, θ1+···+θk
(uk) = e
i(θ1+···+θk)uk,
ρuk+1, −(θ1+···+θk) ◦ ρuk, θ1+···+θk
(uk+1) = e
−i(θ1+···+θk)uk+1,
and thus, using the induction hypothesis for k (2 ≤ k ≤ n − 1), we have
fk+1(uj ) = ρuk+1, −(θ1+···+θk) ◦ ρuk, θ1+···+θk
◦ fk(uj ) = e
iθjuj
, 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1,
fk+1(uk) = ρuk+1, −(θ1+···+θk) ◦ ρuk, θ1+···+θk
◦ fk(uk) = e
i(θ1+···+θk)
e
−i(θ1+···+θk−1)uk = e
iθk uk,
fk+1(uk+1) = ρuk+1, −(θ1+···+θk) ◦ ρuk, θ1+···+θk
◦ fk(uk+1) = e
−i(θ1+···+θk)uk+1,
fk+1(uj ) = ρuk+1, −(θ1+···+θk) ◦ ρuk, θ1+···+θk
◦ fk(uj ) = uj
, k + 1 ≤ j ≤ n,
which proves the induction step.
As a summary, we proved that
fn(uj ) = ( e
iθjuj
if 1 ≤ j ≤ n − 1,
e
−i(θ1+···+θn−1)un when j = n,
but since θ1 +· · ·+θn = 0, we have θn = −(θ1 +· · ·+θn−1), and the last expression is in fact
fn(un) = e
iθn un.
Therefore, we proved that
f = ρun, θn ◦ · · · ◦ ρu1, θ1 = ρun, −(θ1+···+θn−1) ◦ ρun−1, θ1+···+θn−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ρu2, −θ1 ◦ ρu1, θ1
,
and using Proposition 28.3, we also have
f = ρun, −(θ1+···+θn−1) ◦ ρun−1, θ1+···+θn−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ρu2, −θ1 ◦ ρu1, θ1
= hun− un−1 ◦ hun− e
−i(θ1+···+θn−1)un−1
◦ · · · ◦ hu2− u1 ◦ hu2− e−iθ1u1
= hun−1+un ◦ hun−1+ e
i(θ1+···+θn−1)un
◦ · · · ◦ hu1+u2 ◦ hu1+ e
iθ1u2
,
which completes the proof.
We finally get our improved version of the Cartan–Dieudonn´e theorem.
Theorem 28.5. Let E be a Hermitian space of dimension n ≥ 1. Every rotation f ∈ SU(E)
different from the identity is the composition of at most 2n−2 standard hyperplane reflections.
Every isometry f ∈ U(E) different from the identity is the composition of at most 2n − 1
isometries, all standard hyperplane reflections, except for possibly one Hermitian reflection.
When n ≥ 2, the identity is the composition of any reflection with itself.
988 CHAPTER 28. ISOMETRIES OF HERMITIAN SPACES
Proof. By Theorem 28.2, f ∈ SU(n) can be written as a composition
ρun, θn ◦ · · · ◦ ρu1, θ1
,
where (u1, . . . , un) is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Since f is a rotation, det(f) = 1,
and this implies that θ1 + · · · + θn = 0. By Proposition 28.4,
f = hun− un−1 ◦ hun− e
−i(θ1+···+θn−1)un−1
◦ · · · ◦ hu2− u1 ◦ hu2− e−iθ1u1
,
a composition of 2n − 2 hyperplane reflections. In general, if f ∈ U(n), by the remark after
Theorem 28.2, f can be written as f = ρθ ◦ g, where g ∈ SU(n) is a rotation, and ρθ is a
Hermitian reflection. We conclude by applying what we just proved to g.
As a corollary of Theorem 28.5, the following interesting result can be shown (this is not
hard, do it!). First, recall that a linear map f : E → E is self-adjoint (or Hermitian) iff
f = f
∗
. Then, the subgroup of U(n) generated by the Hermitian isometries is equal to the
group
SU(n)
± = {f ∈ U(n) | det(f) = ±1}.
Equivalently, SU(n)
± is equal to the subgroup of U(n) generated by the hyperplane reflec￾tions.
This problem had been left open by Dieudonn´e in [49]. Evidently, it was settled since
the publication of the third edition of the book [49].
Inspection of the proof of Proposition 27.4 reveals that this Proposition also holds for
Hermitian spaces. Thus, when n ≥ 3, the composition of any two hyperplane reflections is
equal to the composition of two flips. As a consequence, a version of Theorem 27.5 holds for
rotations in a Hermitian space of dimension at least 3.
Theorem 28.6. Let E be a Hermitan space of dimension n ≥ 3. Every rotation f ∈ SU(E)
is the composition of an even number of flips f = f2k ◦· · ·◦f1, where k ≤ n−1. Furthermore,
if u 6 = 0 is invariant under f (i.e. u ∈ Ker (f − id)), we can pick the last flip f2k such that
u ∈ F2
⊥
k
, where F2k is the subspace of dimension n − 2 determining f2k.
Proof. It is identical to that of Theorem 27.5, except that it uses Theorem 28.5 instead
of Theorem 27.1. The second part of the Proposition also holds, because if u 6 = 0 is an
eigenvector of f for 1, then u is one of the vectors in the orthonormal basis of eigenvectors
used in 28.2. The details are left as an exercise.
We now show that the QR-decomposition in terms of (complex) Householder matrices
holds for complex matrices. We need the version of Proposition 28.1 and a trick at the end
