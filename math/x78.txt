Therefore, α = 0,
Conversely, given any β ∈ E1⊗· · ·⊗En, assume that h α, βi = 0, for all α ∈ E1

The vector β is a finite linear combination β =

Therefore, β = 0.
By Proposition 33.1,1 we have a canonical isomorphism
(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En)
∗ ∼= E1
∗ ⊗ · · · ⊗ En

.
Here is our main proposition about duality of tensor products.
Proposition 33.16. We have canonical isomorphisms
(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En)
∗ ∼= E1

and
µ: E1
∗ ⊗ · · · ⊗ En

Proof. The second isomorphism follows from the isomorphism (E1⊗· · ·⊗En)
∗ ∼= E1

together with the isomorphism Hom(E1, . . . , En; K) ∼= (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗En)

Remarks:
1. The isomorphism µ: E1

as the linear extension to E1

1This is where the assumption that our spaces are finite-dimensional is used.
1170 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
2. The canonical isomorphism of Proposition 33.16 holds under more general conditions.
Namely, that K is a commutative ring with identity and that the Ei are finitely￾generated projective K-modules (see Definition 35.7). See Bourbaki, [25] (Chapter III,
§11, Section 5, Proposition 7).
We prove another useful canonical isomorphism that allows us to treat linear maps as
tensors.
Let E and F be two vector spaces and let α: E
∗ × F → Hom(E, F) be the map defined
such that
α(u
∗
, f)(x) = u
∗
(x)f,
for all u
∗ ∈ E
∗
, f ∈ F, and x ∈ E. This map is clearly bilinear, and thus it induces a linear
map α⊗ : E
∗ ⊗ F → Hom(E, F) making the following diagram commute

such that
α⊗(u
∗ ⊗ f)(x) = u
∗
(x)f.
Proposition 33.17. If E and F are vector spaces (not necessarily finite dimensional), then
the following properties hold:
(1) The linear map α⊗ : E
∗ ⊗ F → Hom(E, F) is injective.
(2) If E is finite-dimensional, then α⊗ : E
∗⊗F → Hom(E, F) is a canonical isomorphism.
(3) If F is finite-dimensional, then α⊗ : E
∗⊗F → Hom(E, F) is a canonical isomorphism.
Proof. (1) Let (e
∗
i
)i∈I be a basis of E
∗ and let (fj )j∈J be a basis of F. Then we know that
(e
∗
i ⊗ fj )i∈I,j∈J is a basis of E
∗ ⊗ F. To prove that α⊗ is injective, let us show that its kernel
is reduced to (0). For any vector
ω =
X
i∈I
0 ,j∈J0
λij e
∗
i ⊗ fj
in E
∗ ⊗ F, with I
0 and J
0 some finite sets, assume that α⊗(ω) = 0. This means that for
every x ∈ E, we have α⊗(ω)(x) = 0; that is,
i∈I
X
0 ,j∈J0
α⊗(λij e
∗
i ⊗ fj )(x) = X
j∈J0

X i∈I
0
λije
∗
i
(x)
 fj = 0.
33.5. DUALITY FOR TENSOR PRODUCTS 1171
Since (fj )j∈J is a basis of F, for every j ∈ J
0 , we must have
X
i∈I
0
λije
∗
i
(x) = 0, for all x ∈ E.
But then (e
∗
i
)i∈I
0 would be linearly dependent, contradicting the fact that (e
∗
i
)i∈I is a basis
of E
∗
, so we must have
λij = 0, for all i ∈ I
0 and all j ∈ J
0 ,
which shows that ω = 0. Therefore, α⊗ is injective.
(2) Let (ej )1≤j≤n be a finite basis of E, and as usual, let e
∗
j ∈ E
∗ be the linear form
defined by
e
∗
j
(ek) = δj,k,
where δj,k = 1 iff j = k and 0 otherwise. We know that (e
∗
j
)1≤j≤n is a basis of E
∗
(this
is where we use the finite dimension of E). For any linear map f ∈ Hom(E, F), for every
x = x1e1 + · · · + xnen ∈ E, we have
f(x) = f(x1e1 + · · · + xnen) = x1f(e1) + · · · + xnf(en) = e
∗
1
(x)f(e1) + · · · + e
∗
n
(x)f(en).
Consequently, every linear map f ∈ Hom(E, F) can be expressed as
f(x) = e
∗
1
(x)f1 + · · · + e
∗
n
(x)fn,
for some fi ∈ F. Furthermore, if we apply f to ei
, we get f(ei) = fi
, so the fi are unique.
Observe that
(α⊗(e
∗
1 ⊗ f1 + · · · + e
∗
n ⊗ fn))(x) =
nX
i=1
(α⊗(e
∗
i ⊗ fi))(x) =
nX
i=1
e
∗
i
(x)fi
.
Thus, α⊗ is surjective, so α⊗ is a bijection.
(3) Let (f1, . . . , fm) be a finite basis of F, and let (f1
∗
, . . . , fm
∗
) be its dual basis. Given
any linear map h: E → F, for all u ∈ E, since fi
∗
(fj ) = δij , we have
h(u) =
mX
i=1
fi
∗
(h(u))fi
.
If
h(u) =
mX
j=1
vj
∗
(u)fj
for all u ∈ E (∗)
for some linear forms (v1
∗
, . . . , vm
∗
) ∈ (E
∗
)
m, then
fi
∗
(h(u)) =
mX
j=1
vj
∗
(u)fi
∗
(fj ) = vi
∗
(u) for all u ∈ E,
1172 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
which shows that vi
∗ = fi
∗ ◦ h for i = 1, . . . , m. This means that h has a unique expression
in terms of linear forms as in (∗). Define the map α from (E
∗
)
m to Hom(E, F) by
α(v1
∗
, . . . , vm
∗
)(u) =
mX
j=1
vj
∗
(u)fj
for all u ∈ E.
This map is linear. For any h ∈ Hom(E, F), we showed earlier that the expression of h in
(∗) is unique, thus α is an isomorphism. Similarly, E
∗ ⊗ F is isomorphic to (E
∗
)
m. Any
tensor ω ∈ E
∗ ⊗ F can be written as a linear combination
p
X
k=1
u
∗
k ⊗ yk
for some u
∗
k ∈ E
∗ and some yk ∈ F, and since (f1, . . . , fm) is a basis of F, each yk can be
written as a linear combination of (f1, . . . , fm), so ω can be expressed as
ω =
mX
i=1
vi
∗ ⊗ fi
, (†)
for some linear forms vi
∗ ∈ E
∗ which are linear combinations of the u
∗
k
. If we pick a basis
(wi
∗
)i∈I for E
∗
, then we know that the family (wi
∗ ⊗ fj )i∈I,1≤j≤m is a basis of E
∗ ⊗ F, and
this implies that the vi
∗
in (†) are unique. Define the linear map β from (E
∗
)
m to E
∗ ⊗ F by
β(v1
∗
, . . . , vm
∗
) =
mX
i=1
vi
∗ ⊗ fi
.
Since every tensor ω ∈ E
∗ ⊗ F can be written in a unique way as in (†), this map is an
isomorphism.
Note that in Proposition 33.17, we have an isomorphism if either E or F has finite
dimension. The following proposition allows us to view a multilinear as a tensor product.
Proposition 33.18. If the E1, . . . En are finite-dimensional vector spaces and F is any
vector space, then we have the canonical isomorphism
Hom(E1, . . . , En; F) ∼= E1
∗ ⊗ · · · ⊗ En
∗ ⊗ F.
Proof. In view of the canonical isomorphism
Hom(E1, . . . , En; F) ∼= Hom(E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En, F)
given by Proposition 33.7 and the canonical isomorphism (E1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ En)
∗ ∼= E1
∗ ⊗ · · · ⊗ En
∗
given by Proposition 33.16, if the Ei
’s are finite-dimensional, then Proposition 33.17 yields
the canonical isomorphism
Hom(E1, . . . , En; F) ∼= E1
∗ ⊗ · · · ⊗ En
∗ ⊗ F,
as claimed.

33.6 Tensor Algebras
Our goal is to define a vector space T(V ) obtained by taking the direct sum of the tensor
products
V ⊗ · · · ⊗ V
|
{z
}
m
,
and to define a multiplication operation on T(V ) which makes T(V ) into an algebraic struc￾ture called an algebra. The algebra T(V ) satisfies a universal property stated in Proposition
33.19, which makes it the “free algebra” generated by the vector space V .
Definition 33.8. The tensor product
V ⊗ · · · ⊗ V
|
{z
}
m
is also denoted as
m
and is called the m-th tensor power of
O V
V
(with
or
V
⊗
V
1
⊗
=
m
V , and V
⊗0 = K).
We can pack all the tensor powers of V into the “big” vector space
T(V ) = M
m≥0
V
⊗m,
denoted T
•
(V ) or N V to avoid confusion with the tangent bundle.
This is an interesting object because we can define a multiplication operation on it which
makes it into an algebra.
When V is of finite dimension n, we can pick some basis (e1 . . . , en) of V , and then every
tensor ω ∈ T(V ) can be expressed as a linear combination of terms of the form ei1 ⊗· · ·⊗eik
,
where (i1, . . . , ik) is any sequence of elements from the set {1, . . . , n}. We can think of the
tensors ei1 ⊗· · ·⊗eik
as monomials in the noncommuting variables e1, . . . , en. Thus the space
T(V ) corresponds to the algebra of polynomials with coefficients in K in n noncommuting
variables.
Let us review the definition of an algebra over a field. Let K denote any (commutative)
field, although for our purposes, we may assume that K = R (and occasionally, K = C).
Since we will only be dealing with associative algebras with a multiplicative unit, we only
define algebras of this kind.
Definition 33.9. Given a field K, a K-algebra is a K-vector space A together with a bilinear
operation ·: A × A → A, called multiplication, which makes A into a ring with unity 1 (or
1A, when we want to be very precise). This means that · is associative and that there is
a multiplicative identity element 1 so that 1 · a = a · 1 = a, for all a ∈ A. Given two
1174 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
K-algebras A and B, a K-algebra homomorphism h: A → B is a linear map that is also a
ring homomorphism, with h(1A) = 1B; that is,
h(a1 · a2) = h(a1) · h(a2) for all a1, a2 ∈ A
h(1A) = 1B.
The set of K-algebra homomorphisms between A and B is denoted Homalg(A, B).
For example, the ring Mn(K) of all n × n matrices over a field K is a K-algebra.
There is an obvious notion of ideal of a K-algebra.
Definition 33.10. Let A be a K-algebra. An ideal A ⊆ A is a linear subspace of A that is
also a two-sided ideal with respect to multiplication in A; this means that for all a ∈ A and
all α, β ∈ A, we have αaβ ∈ A.
If the field K is understood, we usually simply say an algebra instead of a K-algebra.
We would like to define a multiplication operation on T(V ) which makes it into a K￾algebra. As
T(V ) = M
i≥0
V
⊗i
,
for every i ≥ 0, there is a natural injection ιn : V
⊗n → T(V ), and in particular, an injection
ι0 : K → T(V ). The multiplicative unit 1 of T(V ) is the image ι0(1) in T(V ) of the unit 1
of the field K. Since every v ∈ T(V ) can be expressed as a finite sum
v = ιn1
(v1) + · · · + ιnk
(vk),
where vi ∈ V
⊗ni and the ni are natural numbers with ni 6 = nj
if i 6 = j, to define multiplica￾tion in T(V ), using bilinearity, it is enough to define multiplication operations
·: V
⊗m × V
⊗n −→ V
⊗(m+n)
, which, using the isomorphisms V
⊗n ∼= ιn(V
⊗n
), yield multi￾plication operations ·: ιm(V
⊗m) × ιn(V
⊗n
) −→ ιm+n(V
⊗(m+n)
). First, for ω1 ∈ V
⊗m and
ω2 ∈ V
⊗n
, we let
ω1 · ω2 = ω1 ⊗ ω2.
This defines a bilinear map so it defines a multiplication V
⊗m × V
⊗n −→ V
⊗m ⊗ V
⊗n
. This
is not quite what we want, but there is a canonical isomorphism
V
⊗m ⊗ V
⊗n ∼= V
⊗(m+n)
which yields the desired multiplication ·: V
⊗m × V
⊗n −→ V
⊗(m+n)
.
The isomorphism V
⊗m ⊗ V
⊗n ∼= V
⊗(m+n)
can be established by induction using the
isomorphism (E ⊗ F) ⊗ G ∼= E ⊗ F ⊗ G. First we prove by induction on m ≥ 2 that
V
⊗(m−1) ⊗ V ∼= V
⊗m,
33.6. TENSOR ALGEBRAS 1175
and then by induction on n ≥ 1 than
V
⊗m ⊗ V
⊗n ∼= V
⊗(m+n)
.
In summary the multiplication V
⊗m × V
⊗n −→ V
⊗(m+n)
is defined so that
(v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vm) · (w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wn) = v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vm ⊗ w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wn.
(This has to be made rigorous by using isomorphisms involving the associativity of tensor
products, for details, see Jacobson [99], Section 3.9, or Bertin [15], Chapter 4, Section 2.)
Definition 33.11. Given a K-vector space V (not necessarily finite dimensional), the vector
space
T(V ) = M
m≥0
V
⊗m
denoted T
•
(V ) or N V equipped with the multiplication operations V
⊗m ×V
⊗n −→ V
⊗(m+n)
defined above is called the tensor algebra of V .
Remark: It is important to note that multiplication in T(V ) is not commutative. Also, in
all rigor, the unit 1 of T(V ) is not equal to 1, the unit of the field K. However, in view
of the injection ι0 : K → T(V ), for the sake of notational simplicity, we will denote 1 by 1.
More generally, in view of the injections ιn : V
⊗n → T(V ), we identify elements of V
⊗n with
their images in T(V ).
The algebra T(V ) satisfies a universal mapping property which shows that it is unique
up to isomorphism. For simplicity of notation, let i: V → T(V ) be the natural injection of
V into T(V ).
Proposition 33.19. Given any K-algebra A, for any linear map f : V → A, there is a
unique K-algebra homomorphism f : T(V ) → A so that
f = f ◦ i,
as in the diagram below.

Proof. Left an an exercise (use Theorem 33.6). A proof can be found in Knapp [104] (Ap￾pendix A, Proposition A.14) or Bertin [15] (Chapter 4, Theorem 2.4).
Proposition 33.19 implies that there is a natural isomorphism
Homalg(T(V ), A) ∼= Hom(V, A),
where the algebra A on the right-hand side is viewed as a vector space. Proposition 33.19
also has the following corollary.
1176 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
Proposition 33.20. Given a linear map h: V1 → V2 between two vectors spaces V1, V2

Most algebras of interest arise as well-chosen quotients of the tensor algebra T(V ). This
is true for the exterior algebra V (V ) (also called Grassmann algebra), where we take the
quotient of T(V ) modulo the ideal generated by all elements of the form v ⊗ v, where
v ∈ V ,and for the symmetric algebra Sym(V ), where we take the quotient of T(V ) modulo
the ideal generated by all elements of the form v ⊗ w − w ⊗ v, where v, w ∈ V .
Algebras such as T(V ) are graded in the sense that there is a sequence of subspaces
V
⊗n ⊆ T(V ) such that
T(V ) = M
k≥0
V
⊗n
,
and the multiplication ⊗ behaves well w.r.t. the grading, i.e., ⊗: V
⊗m × V
⊗n → V
⊗(m+n)
.
Definition 33.12. A K-algebra E is said to be a graded algebra iff there is a sequence of
subspaces E
n ⊆ E such that
E =

k≥0

(with E
0 = K) and the multiplication · respects the grading; that is, ·: E

Elements in E
n are called homogeneous elements of rank (or degree) n.
In differential geometry and in physics it is necessary to consider slightly more general
tensors.
Definition 33.13. Given a vector space V , for any pair of nonnegative integers (r, s), the
tensor space T
r,s(V ) of type (r, s) is the tensor product

Denote by Hom(V
r
,(V

)
s
; W) the vector space of all multilinear maps from V
r × (V

to W. Then we have the universal mapping property which asserts that there is a canonical
isomorphism
Hom(T
r,s(V ), W) ∼= Hom(V
r
,(V

)
s
; W).
In particular,
(T
r,s(V ))∗ ∼= Hom(V

For finite dimensional vector spaces, the duality of Section 33.5 is also easily extended to the
tensor spaces T
r,s(V ). We define the pairing
T
r,s(V
∗
) × T
r,s(V ) −→ K
as follows: if
v
∗ = v
∗
1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr
∗ ⊗ ur+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ur+s ∈ T
r,s(V
∗
)
and
u = u1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ur ⊗ vr
∗
+1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr
∗
+s ∈ T
r,s(V ),
then
(v
∗
, u) = v1
∗
(u1)· · · vr
∗
+s
(ur+s).
This is a nondegenerate pairing, and thus we get a canonical isomorphism
(T
r,s(V ))∗ ∼= T
r,s(V
∗
).
Consequently, we get a canonical isomorphism
T
r,s(V
∗
) ∼= Hom(V
r
,(V
∗
)
s
; K).
We summarize these results in the following proposition.
Proposition 33.21. Let V be a vector space and let
T
r,s(V ) = V
⊗r ⊗ (V
∗
)
⊗s = V
| ⊗ · · · ⊗ {z V
}
r

.
We have the canonical isomorphisms
(T
r,s(V ))∗ ∼= T
r,s(V
∗
),
and
T
r,s(V
∗
) ∼= Hom(V
r
,(V

1178 CHAPTER 33. TENSOR ALGEBRAS
Remark: The tensor spaces, T
r,s(V ) are also denoted Ts
r
(V ). A tensor α ∈ T
r,s(V ) is
said to be contravariant in the first r arguments and covariant in the last s arguments.
This terminology refers to the way tensors behave under coordinate changes. Given a basis
(e1, . . . , en) of V , if (e
∗
1
, . . . , e∗
n
) denotes the dual basis, then every tensor α ∈ T
r,s(V ) is given
by an expression of the form

The tradition in classical tensor notation is to use lower indices on vectors and upper
indices on linear forms and in accordance to Einstein summation convention (or Einstein
notation) the position of the indices on the coefficients is reversed. Einstein summation
