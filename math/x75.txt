32.1 Unique Factorization Domains (Factorial Rings)
We saw in Section 30.5 that if K is a field, then every nonnull polynomial in K[X] can
be factored as a product of irreducible factors, and that such a factorization is essentially
unique. The same property holds for the ring K[X1, . . . , Xn] where n ≥ 2, but a different
proof is needed.
The reason why unique factorization holds for K[X1, . . . , Xn] is that if A is an integral
domain for which unique factorization holds in some suitable sense, then the property of
unique factorization lifts to the polynomial ring A[X]. Such rings are called factorial rings,
or unique factorization domains. The first step if to define the notion of irreducible element
in an integral domain, and then to define a factorial ring. If will turn out that in a factorial
ring, any nonnull element a is irreducible (or prime) iff the principal ideal (a) is a prime
ideal.
Recall that given a ring A, a unit is any invertible element (w.r.t. multiplication). The
set of units of A is denoted by A∗
. It is a multiplicative subgroup of A, with identity 1. Also,
given a, b ∈ A, recall that a divides b if b = ac for some c ∈ A; equivalently, a divides b iff
(b) ⊆ (a). Any nonzero a ∈ A is divisible by any unit u, since a = u(u
−1a). The relation “a
divides b,” often denoted by a | b, is reflexive and transitive, and thus, a preorder on A− {0}.
Definition 32.1. Let A be an integral domain. Some element a ∈ A is irreducible if a 6 = 0,
a /∈ A∗
(a is not a unit), and whenever a = bc, then either b or c is a unit (where b, c ∈ A).
Equivalently, a ∈ A is reducible if a = 0, or a ∈ A∗
(a is a unit), or a = bc where b, c /∈ A∗
(a, b are both noninvertible) and b, c 6 = 0.
Observe that if a ∈ A is irreducible and u ∈ A is a unit, then ua is also irreducible.
Generally, if a ∈ A, a 6 = 0, and u is a unit, then a and ua are said to be associated. This
is the equivalence relation on nonnull elements of A induced by the divisibility preorder.
1117
1118 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
The following simple proposition gives a sufficient condition for an element a ∈ A to be
irreducible.
Proposition 32.1. Let A be an integral domain. For any a ∈ A with a 6 = 0, if the principal
ideal (a) is a prime ideal, then a is irreducible.
Proof. If (a) is prime, then (a) 6 = A and a is not a unit. Assume that a = bc. Then, bc ∈ (a),
and since (a) is prime, either b ∈ (a) or c ∈ (a). Consider the case where b ∈ (a), the other
case being similar. Then, b = ax for some x ∈ A. As a consequence,
a = bc = axc,
and since A is an integral domain and a 6 = 0, we get
1 = xc,
which proves that c = x
−1
is a unit.
It should be noted that the converse of Proposition 32.1 is generally false. However, it
holds for factorial rings, defined next.
Definition 32.2. A factorial ring or unique factorization domain (UFD) (or unique factor￾ization ring) is an integral domain A such that the following two properties hold:
(1) For every nonnull a ∈ A, if a /∈ A∗
(a is not a unit), then a can be factored as a product
a = a1 · · · am
where each ai ∈ A is irreducible (m ≥ 1).
(2) For every nonnull a ∈ A, if a /∈ A∗
(a is not a unit) and if
a = a1 · · · am = b1 · · · bn
where ai ∈ A and bj ∈ A are irreducible, then m = n and there is a permutation σ of
{1, . . . , m} and some units u1, . . . , um ∈ A∗
such that ai = uibσ(i)
for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
Example 32.1. The ring Z of integers if a typical example of a UFD. Given a field K, the
polynomial ring K[X] is a UFD. More generally, we will show later that every PID is a UFD
(see Theorem 32.12). Thus, in particular, Z[X] is a UFD. However, we leave as an exercise
to prove that the ideal (2X, X2
) generated by 2X and X2
is not principal, and thus, Z[X]
is not a PID.
First, we prove that condition (2) in Definition 32.2 is equivalent to the usual “Euclidean”
condition.
32.1. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION DOMAINS (FACTORIAL RINGS) 1119

There are integral domains that are not UFD’s. For example, the subring Z[
√
−5] of C
consisting of the complex numbers of the form a + bi√
5 where a, b ∈ Z is not a UFD.
Indeed, we have
9 = 3 · 3 = (2 + i
√
5)(2 − i
√
5),
and it can be shown that 3, 2 + i
√
5, and 2 − i
√
5 are irreducible, and that the units are ±1.
The uniqueness condition (2) fails and Z[
√
−5] is not a UFD.
Remark: For d ∈ Z with d < 0, it is known that the ring of integers of Q(
√
d) is a UFD iff d
is one of the nine primes, d = −1, −2, −3, −7, −11, −19, −43, −67 and −163. This is a hard
theorem that was conjectured by Gauss but not proved until 1966, independently by Stark
and Baker. Heegner had published a proof of this result in 1952 but there was some doubt
about its validity. After finding his proof, Stark reexamined Heegner’s proof and concluded
that it was essentially correct after all. In sharp contrast, when d is a positive integer, the
problem of determining which of the rings of integers of Q(
√
d) are UFD’s, is still open. It
can also be shown that if d < 0, then the ring Z[
√
d] is a UFD iff d = −1 or d = −2. If
d ≡ 1 (mod 4), then Z[
√
d] is never a UFD. For more details about these remarkable results,
see Stark [164] (Chapter 8).
Proposition 32.2. Let A be an integral domain satisfying condition (1) in Definition 32.2.
Then, condition (2) in Definition 32.2 is equivalent to the following condition:
(2
0 ) If a ∈ A is irreducible and a divides the product bc, where b, c ∈ A and b, c 6 = 0, then
either a divides b or a divides c.
Proof. First, assume that (2) holds. Let bc = ad, where d ∈ A, d 6 = 0. If b is a unit, then
c = adb−1
,
and c is divisible by a. A similar argument applies to c. Thus, we may assume that b and c
are not units. In view of (1), we can write
b = p1 · · · pm and c = pm+1 · · · qm+n,
where pi ∈ A is irreducible. Since bc = ad, a is irreducible, and b, c are not units, d cannot
be a unit. In view of (1), we can write
d = q1 · · · qr,
where qi ∈ A is irreducible. Thus,
p1 · · · pmpm+1 · · · pm+n = aq1 · · · qr,
where all the factors involved are irreducible. By (2), we must have
a = ui0 pi0
1120 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
for some unit ui0 ∈ A and some index i0, 1 ≤ i0 ≤ m + n. As a consequence, if 1 ≤ i0 ≤ m,
then a divides b, and if m + 1 ≤ i0 ≤ m + n, then a divides c. This proves that (20 ) holds.
Let us now assume that (20 ) holds. Assume that
a = a1 · · · am = b1 · · · bn,
where ai ∈ A and bj ∈ A are irreducible. Without loss of generality, we may assume that
m ≤ n. We proceed by induction on m. If m = 1,
a1 = b1 · · · bn,
and since a1 is irreducible, u = b1 · · · bi−1bi+1bn must be a unit for some i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Thus,
(2) holds with n = 1 and a1 = biu. Assume that m > 1 and that the induction hypothesis
holds for m − 1. Since
a1a2 · · · am = b1 · · · bn,
a1 divides b1 · · · bn, and in view of (20 ), a1 divides some bj
. Since a1 and bj are irreducible,
we must have bj = uja1, where uj ∈ A is a unit. Since A is an integral domain,
a1a2 · · · am = b1 · · · bj−1uja1bj+1 · · · bn
implies that
a2 · · · am = (uj b1)· · · bj−1bj+1 · · · bn,
and by the induction hypothesis, m − 1 = n − 1 and ai = vibτ(i)
for some units vi ∈ A and
some bijection τ between {2, . . . , m} and {1, . . . , j − 1, j + 1, . . . , m}. However, the bijection
τ extends to a permutation σ of {1, . . . , m} by letting σ(1) = j, and the result holds by
letting v1 = u
−
j
1
.
As a corollary of Proposition 32.2. we get the converse of Proposition 32.1.
Proposition 32.3. Let A be a factorial ring. For any a ∈ A with a 6 = 0, the principal ideal
(a) is a prime ideal iff a is irreducible.
Proof. In view of Proposition 32.1, we just have to prove that if a ∈ A is irreducible, then the
principal ideal (a) is a prime ideal. Indeed, if bc ∈ (a), then a divides bc, and by Proposition
32.2, property (20 ) implies that either a divides b or a divides c, that is, either b ∈ (a) or
c ∈ (a), which means that (a) is prime.
Because Proposition 32.3 holds, in a UFD, an irreducible element is often called a prime.
In a UFD A, every nonzero element a ∈ A that is not a unit can be expressed as a
product a = a1 · · · an of irreducible elements ai
, and by property (2), the number n of factors
only depends on a, that is, it is the same for all factorizations into irreducible factors. We
agree that this number is 0 for a unit.
Remark: If A is a UFD, we can state the factorization properties so that they also applies
to units:
32.1. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION DOMAINS (FACTORIAL RINGS) 1121
(1) For every nonnull a ∈ A, a can be factored as a product
a = ua1 · · · am
where u ∈ A∗
(u is a unit) and each ai ∈ A is irreducible (m ≥ 0).
(2) For every nonnull a ∈ A, if
a = ua1 · · · am = vb1 · · · bn
where u, v ∈ A∗
(u, v are units) and ai ∈ A and bj ∈ A are irreducible, then m = n,
and if m = n = 0 then u = v, else if m ≥ 1, then there is a permutation σ of {1, . . . , m}
and some units u1, . . . , um ∈ A∗
such that ai = uibσ(i)
for all i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
We are now ready to prove that if A is a UFD, then the polynomial ring A[X] is also a
UFD.
First, observe that the units of A[X] are just the units of A. The fact that nonnull
and nonunit polynomials in A[X] factor as products of irreducible polynomials is easier to
prove than uniqueness. We will show in the proof of Theorem 32.10 that we can proceed by
induction on the pairs (m, n) where m is the degree of f(X) and n is either 0 if the coefficient
fm of Xm in f(X) is a unit of n is fm is the product of n irreducible elements.
For the uniqueness of the factorization, by Proposition 32.2, it is enough to prove that
condition (20 ) holds. This is a little more tricky. There are several proofs, but they all involve
a pretty Lemma due to Gauss.
First, note the following trivial fact. Given a ring A, for any a ∈ A, a 6 = 0, if a divides
every coefficient of some nonnull polynomial f(X) ∈ A[X], then a divides f(X). If A is an
integral domain, we get the following converse.
Proposition 32.4. Let A be an integral domain. For any a ∈ A, a 6 = 0, if a divides a
nonnull polynomial f(X) ∈ A[X], then a divides every coefficient of f(X).
Proof. Assume that f(X) = ag(X), for some g(X) ∈ A[X]. Since a 6 = 0 and A is an
integral ring, f(X) and g(X) have the same degree m, and since for every i (0 ≤ i ≤ m)
the coefficient of Xi
in f(X) is equal to the coefficient of Xi
in ag(x), we have fi = agi
, and
whenever fi 6 = 0, we see that a divides fi
.
Lemma 32.5. (Gauss’s lemma) Let A be a UFD. For any a ∈ A, if a is irreducible and a
divides the product f(X)g(X) of two polynomials f(X), g(X) ∈ A[X], then either a divides
f(X) or a divides g(X).
Proof. Let f(X) = fmXm + · · · + fiXi + · · · + f0 and g(X) = gnXn + · · · + gjXj + · · · + g0.
Assume that a divides neither f(X) nor g(X). By the (easy) converse of Proposition 32.4,
there is some i (0 ≤ i ≤ m) such that a does not divide fi
, and there is some j (0 ≤ j ≤ n)
1122 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
such that a does not divide gj
. Pick i and j minimal such that a does not divide fi and a
does not divide gj
. The coefficient ci+j of Xi+j
in f(X)g(X) is
ci+j = f0gi+j + f1gi+j−1 + · · · + figj + · · · + fi+jg0
(letting fh = 0 if h > m and gk = 0 if k > n). From the choice of i and j, a cannot divide
figj
, since a being irreducible, by (20 ) of Proposition 32.2, a would divide fi or gj
. However,
by the choice of i and j, a divides every other nonnull term in the sum for ci+j
, and since a
is irreducible and divides f(X)g(X), by Proposition 32.4, a divides ci+j
, which implies that
a divides figj
, a contradiction. Thus, either a divides f(X) or a divides g(X).
As a corollary, we get the following proposition.
Proposition 32.6. Let A be a UFD. For any a ∈ A, a 6 = 0, if a divides the product
f(X)g(X) of two polynomials f(X), g(X) ∈ A[X] and f(X) is irreducible and of degree at
least 1, then a divides g(X).
Proof. The Proposition is trivial is a is a unit. Otherwise, a = a1 · · · am where ai ∈ A is
irreducible. Using induction and applying Lemma 32.5, we conclude that a divides g(X).
We now show that Lemma 32.5 also applies to the case where a is an irreducible polyno￾mial. This requires a little excursion involving the fraction field F of A.
Remark: If A is a UFD, it is possible to prove the uniqueness condition (2) for A[X] directly
without using the fraction field of A, see Malliavin [119], Chapter 3.
Given an integral domain A, we can construct a field F such that every element of F
is of the form a/b, where a, b ∈ A, b 6 = 0, using essentially the method for constructing the
field Q of rational numbers from the ring Z of integers.
Proposition 32.7. Let A be an integral domain.
(1) There is a field F and an injective ring homomorphism i: A → F such that every
element of F is of the form i(a)i(b)
−1
, where a, b ∈ A, b 6 = 0.
(2) For every field K and every injective ring homomorphism h: A → K, there is a
(unique) field homomorphism b h: F → K such that
b
h(i(a)i(b)
−1
) = h(a)h(b)
−1
for all a, b ∈ A, b 6 = 0.
(3) The field F in (1) is unique up to isomorphism.
32.1. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION DOMAINS (FACTORIAL RINGS) 1123
Proof. (1) Consider the binary relation ' on A × (A − {0}) defined as follows:
(a, b) ' (a
0 , b0 ) iff ab0 = a
0 b.
It is easily seen that ' is an equivalence relation. Note that the fact that A is an integral
domain is used to prove transitivity. The equivalence class of (a, b) is denoted by a/b. Clearly,
(0, b) ' (0, 1) for all b ∈ A, and we denote the class of (0, 1) also by 0. The equivalence class
a/1 of (a, 1) is also denoted by a. We define addition and multiplication on A × (A − {0})
as follows:
(a, b) + (a
0 , b0 ) = (ab0 + a
0 b, bb0 ),
(a, b) · (a
0 , b0 ) = (aa0 , bb0 ).
It is easily verified that ' is congruential w.r.t. + and ·, which means that + and · are
well-defined on equivalence classes modulo ' . When a, b 6 = 0, the inverse of a/b is b/a, and
it is easily verified that F is a field. The map i: A → F defined such that i(a) = a/1 is an
injection of A into F and clearly
a
b
= i(a)i(b)
−1
.
(2) Given an injective ring homomorphism h: A → K into a field K,
a
b
=
a
0
b
0
iff ab0 = a
0 b,
which implies that
h(a)h(b
0 ) = h(a
0 )h(b),
and since h is injective and b, b0 6 = 0, we get
h(a)h(b)
−1 = h(a
0 )h(b
0 )
−1
.
Thus, there is a map b h: F → K such that
b
h(a/b) = b h(i(a)i(b)
−1
) = h(a)h(b)
−1
for all a, b ∈ A, b 6 = 0, and it is easily checked that b h is a field homomorphism. The map b h
is clearly unique.
(3) The uniqueness of F up to isomorphism follows from (2), and is left as an exercise.
The field F given by Proposition 32.7 is called the fraction field of A, and it is denoted
by Frac(A).
In particular, given an integral domain A, since A[X1, . . . , Xn] is also an integral do￾main, we can form the fraction field of the polynomial ring A[X1, . . . , Xn], denoted by
F(X1, . . . , Xn), where F = Frac(A) is the fraction field of A. It is also called the field
1124 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
of rational functions over F, although the terminology is a bit misleading, since elements of
F(X1, . . . , Xn) only define functions when the dominator is nonnull.
We now have the following crucial lemma which shows that if a polynomial f(X) is
reducible over F[X] where F is the fraction field of A, then f(X) is already reducible over
A[X].
Lemma 32.8. Let A be a UFD and let F be the fraction field of A. For any nonnull
polynomial f(X) ∈ A[X] of degree m, if f(X) is not the product of two polynomials of
degree strictly smaller than m, then f(X) is irreducible in F[X].
Proof. Assume that f(X) is reducible in F[X] and that f(X) is neither null nor a unit.
Then,
f(X) = G(X)H(X),
where G(X), H(X) ∈ F[X] are polynomials of degree p, q ≥ 1. Let a be the product of
the denominators of the coefficients of G(X), and b the product of the denominators of
the coefficients of H(X). Then, a, b 6 = 0, g1(X) = aG(X) ∈ A[X] has degree p ≥ 1,
h1(X) = bH(X) ∈ A[X] has degree q ≥ 1, and
abf(X) = g1(X)h1(X).
Let c = ab. If c is a unit, then f(X) is also reducible in A[X]. Otherwise, c = c1 · · · cn,
where ci ∈ A is irreducible. We now use induction on n to prove that
f(X) = g(X)h(X),
for some polynomials g(X) ∈ A[X] of degree p ≥ 1 and h(X) ∈ A[X] of degree q ≥ 1.
If n = 1, since c = c1 is irreducible, by Lemma 32.5, either c divides g1(X) or c divides
h1(X). Say that c divides g1(X), the other case being similar. Then, g1(X) = cg(X) for
some g(X) ∈ A[X] of degree p ≥ 1, and since A[X] is an integral ring, we get
f(X) = g(X)h1(X),
showing that f(X) is reducible in A[X]. If n > 1, since
c1 · · · cnf(X) = g1(X)h1(X),
c1 divides g1(X)h1(X), and as above, either c1 divides g1(X) or c divides h1(X). In either
case, we get
c2 · · · cnf(X) = g2(X)h2(X)
for some polynomials g2(X) ∈ A[X] of degree p ≥ 1 and h2(X) ∈ A[X] of degree q ≥ 1. By
the induction hypothesis, we get
f(X) = g(X)h(X),
for some polynomials g(X) ∈ A[X] of degree p ≥ 1 and h(X) ∈ A[X] of degree q ≥ 1,
showing that f(X) is reducible in A[X].
32.1. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION DOMAINS (FACTORIAL RINGS) 1125
Finally, we can prove that (20 ) holds.
Lemma 32.9. Let A be a UFD. Given any three nonnull polynomials f(X), g(X), h(X) ∈
A[X], if f(X) is irreducible and f(X) divides the product g(X)h(X), then either f(X)
divides g(X) or f(X) divides h(X).
Proof. If f(X) has degree 0, then the result follows from Lemma 32.5. Thus, we may assume
that the degree of f(X) is m ≥ 1. Let F be the fraction field of A. By Lemma 32.8, f(X)
is also irreducible in F[X]. Since F[X] is a UFD (by Theorem 30.17), either f(X) divides
g(X) or f(X) divides h(X), in F[X]. Assume that f(X) divides g(X), the other case being
similar. Then,
g(X) = f(X)G(X),
for some G(X) ∈ F[X]. If a is the product the denominators of the coefficients of G, we
have
ag(X) = q1(X)f(X),
where q1(X) = aG(X) ∈ A[X]. If a is a unit, we see that f(X) divides g(X). Otherwise,
a = a1 · · · an, where ai ∈ A is irreducible. We prove by induction on n that
g(X) = q(X)f(X)
for some q(X) ∈ A[X].
If n = 1, since f(X) is irreducible and of degree m ≥ 1 and
a1g(X) = q1(X)f(X),
by Lemma 32.5, a1 divides q1(X). Thus, q1(X) = a1q(X) where q(X) ∈ A[X]. Since A[X]
is an integral domain, we get
g(X) = q(X)f(X),
and f(X) divides g(X). If n > 1, from
a1 · · · ang(X) = q1(X)f(X),
we note that a1 divides q1(X)f(X), and as in the previous case, a1 divides q1(X). Thus,
q1(X) = a1q2(X) where q2(X) ∈ A[X], and we get
a2 · · · ang(X) = q2(X)f(X).
By the induction hypothesis, we get
g(X) = q(X)f(X)
for some q(X) ∈ A[X], and f(X) divides g(X).
We finally obtain the fact that A[X] is a UFD when A is.
1126 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
Theorem 32.10. If A is a UFD then the polynomial ring A[X] is also a UFD.
Proof. As we said earlier, the factorization property (1) is easier to prove than uniqueness.
Assume that f(X) has degree m and let fm be the coefficient of Xm in f(X). Either fm is
a unit or it is the product of n ≥ 1 irreducible elements. If fm is a unit we set n = 0. We
proceed by induction on the pair (m, n), using the well-founded ordering on pairs, i.e.,
(m, n) ≤ (m0 , n0 )
iff either m < m0 , or m = m0 and n < n0 . If f(X) is a nonnull polynomial of degree 0 which
is not a unit, then f(X) ∈ A, and f(X) = fm = a1 · · · an for some irreducible ai ∈ A, since
A is a UFD. This proves the base case.
If f(X) has degree m > 0 and f(X) is reducible, then
f(X) = g(X)h(X),
where g(X) and h(X) have degree p, q ≤ m and are not units. There are two cases.
(1) fm is a unit (so n = 0).
If so, since fm = gphq (where gp is the coefficient of Xp
in g(X) and hq is the coefficient
of Xq
in h(X)), then gp and hq are both units. We claim that p, q ≥ 1. Otherwise, p = 0
or q = 0, but then either g(X) = g0 is a unit or h(X) = h0 is a unit, a contradiction.
Now, since m = p + q and p, q ≥ 1, we have p, q < m so (p, 0) < (m, 0) and
(q, 0) < (m, 0), and by the induction hypothesis, both g(X) and h(X) can be written
as products of irreducible factors, thus so can f(X).
(2) fm is not a unit, say fm = a1 · · · an where a1, . . . , an are irreducible and n ≥ 1.
(a) If p, q < m, then (p, n1) < (m, n) and (q, n2) < (m, n) where n1 is the number of
irreducible factors of gp or n1 = 0 if gp is irreducible, and similarly n2 is the number
of irreducible factors of hp or n2 = 0 if hp is irreducible (note that n1, n2 ≤ n and
it is possible that n1 = n if hq is irreducible or n2 = n if gp is irreducible). By the
induction hypothesis, g(X) and h(X) can be written as products of irreducible
polynomials, thus so can f(X).
(b) If p = 0 and q = m, then g(X) = gp and by hypothesis gp is not a unit. Since
fm = a1 · · · an = gphq and gp is not a unit, either hq is not a unit in which case, by
the uniqueness of the number of irreducible elements in the decomposition of fm
(since A is a UFD), hq is the product of n2 < n irreducible elements, or n2 = 0
if hq is irreducible. Since n ≥ 1, this implies that (m, n2) < (m, n), and by the
induction hypothesis h(X) can be written as products of irreducible polynomials.
Since gp ∈ A is not a unit, it can also be written as a product of irreducible
elements, thus so can f(X).
The case where p = m and q = 0 is similar to the previous case.
32.1. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION DOMAINS (FACTORIAL RINGS) 1127
Property (20 ) follows by Lemma 32.9. By Proposition 32.2, A[X] is a UFD.
As a corollary of Theorem 32.10 and using induction, we note that for any field K, the
polynomial ring K[X1, . . . , Xn] is a UFD.
For the sake of completeness, we shall prove that every PID is a UFD. First, we review
the notion of gcd and the characterization of gcd’s in a PID.
Given an integral domain A, for any two elements a, b ∈ A, a, b 6 = 0, we say that d ∈ A
(d 6 = 0) is a greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b if
(1) d divides both a and b.
(2) For any h ∈ A (h 6 = 0), if h divides both a and b, then h divides d.
We also say that a and b are relatively prime if 1 is a gcd of a and b.
Note that a and b are relatively prime iff every gcd of a and b is a unit. If A is a PID,
then gcd’s are characterized as follows.
Proposition 32.11. Let A be a PID.
(1) For any a, b, d ∈ A (a, b, d 6 = 0), d is a gcd of a and b iff
(d) = (a, b) = (a) + (b),
i.e., d generates the principal ideal generated by a and b.
(2) (Bezout identity) Two nonnull elements a, b ∈ A are relatively prime iff there are some
x, y ∈ A such that
ax + by = 1.
Proof. (1) Recall that the ideal generated by a and b is the set
(a) + (b) = aA + bA = {ax + by | x, y ∈ A}.
First, assume that d is a gcd of a and b. If so, a ∈ Ad, b ∈ Ad, and thus, (a) ⊆ (d) and
(b) ⊆ (d), so that
(a) + (b) ⊆ (d).
Since A is a PID, there is some t ∈ A, t 6 = 0, such that
(a) + (b) = (t),
and thus, (a) ⊆ (t) and (b) ⊆ (t), which means that t divides both a and b. Since d is a gcd
of a and b, t must divide d. But then,
(d) ⊆ (t) = (a) + (b),
1128 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
and thus, (d) = (a) + (b).
Assume now that
(d) = (a) + (b) = (a, b).
Since (a) ⊆ (d) and (b) ⊆ (d), d divides both a and b. Assume that t divides both a and b,
so that (a) ⊆ (t) and (b) ⊆ (t). Then,
(d) = (a) + (b) ⊆ (t),
which means that t divides d, and d is indeed a gcd of a and b.
(2) By (1), if a and b are relatively prime, then
(1) = (a) + (b),
which yields the result. Conversely, if
ax + by = 1,
then
(1) = (a) + (b),
and 1 is a gcd of a and b.
Given two nonnull elements a, b ∈ A, if a is an irreducible element and a does not divide
b, then a and b are relatively prime. Indeed, if d is not a unit and d divides both a and b,
then a = dp and b = dq where p must be a unit, so that
b = ap−1
q,
and a divides b, a contradiction.
Theorem 32.12. Let A be ring. If A is a PID, then A is a UFD.
Proof. First, we prove that every nonnull element that is a not a unit can be factored as a
product of irreducible elements. Let S be the set of nontrivial principal ideals (a) such that
a 6 = 0 is not a unit and cannot be factored as a product of irreducible elements (in particular,
a is not irreducible). Assume that S is nonempty. We claim that every ascending chain in
S is finite. Otherwise, consider an infinite ascending chain
(a1) ⊂ (a2) ⊂ · · · ⊂ (an) ⊂ · · · .
It is immediately verified that
[
n≥1
(an)
is an ideal in A. Since A is a PID,
[
n≥1
(an) = (a)
32.1. UNIQUE FACTORIZATION DOMAINS (FACTORIAL RINGS) 1129
for some a ∈ A. However, there must be some n such that a ∈ (an), and thus,
(an) ⊆ (a) ⊆ (an),
and the chain stabilizes at (an).
As a consequence, there are maximal ideals in S. Let (a) be a maximal ideal in S. Then,
for any ideal (d) such that
(a) ⊂ (d) and (a) 6 = (d),
we must have d /∈ S, since otherwise (a) would not be a maximal ideal in S. Observe that
a is not irreducible, since (a) ∈ S, and thus,
a = bc
for some b, c ∈ A, where neither b nor c is a unit. Then,
(a) ⊆ (b) and (a) ⊆ (c).
If (a) = (b), then b = au for some u ∈ A, and then
a = auc,
so that
1 = uc,
since A is an integral domain, and thus, c is a unit, a contradiction. Thus, (a) 6 = (b), and
similarly, (a) 6 = (c). But then, by a previous observation b /∈ S and c /∈ S, and since a and b
are not units, both b and c factor as products of irreducible elements and so does a = bc, a
contradiction. This implies that S = ∅, so every nonnull element that is a not a unit can be
factored as a product of irreducible elements
To prove the uniqueness of factorizations, we use Proposition 32.2. Assume that a is
irreducible and that a divides bc. If a does not divide b, by a previous remark, a and b are
relatively prime, and by Proposition 32.11, there are some x, y ∈ A such that
ax + by = 1.
Thus,
acx + bcy = c,
and since a divides bc, we see that a must divide c, as desired.
Thus, we get another justification of the fact that Z is a UFD and that if K is a field,
then K[X] is a UFD.
It should also be noted that in a UFD, gcd’s of nonnull elements always exist. Indeed,
this is trivial if a or b is a unit, and otherwise, we can write
a = p1 · · · pm and b = q1 · · · qn
1130 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
where pi
, qj ∈ A are irreducible, and the product of the common factors of a and b is a gcd
of a and b (it is 1 is there are no common factors).
We conclude this section on UFD’s by proving a proposition characterizing when a UFD
is a PID. The proof is nontrivial and makes use of Zorn’s lemma (several times).
Proposition 32.13. Let A be a ring that is a UFD, and not a field. Then, A is a PID iff
every nonzero prime ideal is maximal.
Proof. Assume that A is a PID that is not a field. Consider any nonzero prime ideal, (p),
and pick any proper ideal A in A such that
(p) ⊆ A.
Since A is a PID, the ideal A is a principal ideal, so A = (q), and since A is a proper nonzero
ideal, q 6 = 0 and q is not a unit. Since
(p) ⊆ (q),
q divides p, and we have p = qp1 for some p1 ∈ A. Now, by Proposition 32.1, since p 6 = 0
and (p) is a prime ideal, p is irreducible. But then, since p = qp1 and p is irreducible, p1
must be a unit (since q is not a unit), which implies that
(p) = (q);
that is, (p) is a maximal ideal.
Conversely, let us assume that every nonzero prime ideal is maximal. First, we prove that
every prime ideal is principal. This is obvious for (0). If A is a nonzero prime ideal, then,
by hypothesis, it is maximal. Since A 6 = (0), there is some nonzero element a ∈ A. Since A
is maximal, a is not a unit, and since A is a UFD, there is a factorization a = a1 · · · an of a
into irreducible elements. Since A is prime, we have ai ∈ A for some i. Now, by Proposition
32.3, since ai
is irreducible, the ideal (ai) is prime, and so, by hypothesis, (ai) is maximal.
Since (ai) ⊆ A and (ai) is maximal, we get A = (ai).
Next, assume that A is not a PID. Define the set, F, by
F = {A | A ⊆ A, A is not a principal ideal}.
Since A is not a PID, the set F is nonempty. Also, the reader will easily check that every
chain in F is bounded in F. Indeed, for any chain (Ai)i∈I of ideals in F it is not hard to
verify that S i∈I Ai
is an ideal which is not principal, so S i∈I Ai ∈ F. Then, by Zorn’s lemma
(Lemma C.1), the set F has some maximal element, A. Clearly, A 6 = (0) is a proper ideal
(since A = (1)), and A is not prime, since we just showed that prime ideals are principal.
Then, by Theorem C.3, there is some maximal ideal, M, so that A ⊂ M. However, a
maximal ideal is prime, and we have shown that a prime ideal is principal. Thus,
A ⊆ (p),
32.2. THE CHINESE REMAINDER THEOREM 1131
for some p ∈ A that is not a unit. Moreover, by Proposition 32.1, the element p is irreducible.
Define
B = {a ∈ A | pa ∈ A}.
Clearly, A = pB, B 6 = (0), A ⊆ B, and B is a proper ideal. We claim that A 6 = B. Indeed,
if A = B were true, then we would have A = pB = B, but this is impossible since p is
irreducible, A is a UFD, and B 6 = (0) (we get B = p
mB for all m, and every element of B
would be a multiple of p
m for arbitrarily large m, contradicting the fact that A is a UFD).
Thus, we have A ⊂ B, and since A is a maximal element of F, we must have B ∈ F / .
However, B ∈ F / means that B is a principal ideal, and thus, A = pB is also a principal
ideal, a contradiction.
Observe that the above proof shows that Proposition 32.13 also holds under the assump￾tion that every prime ideal is principal.
32.2 The Chinese Remainder Theorem
In this section, which is a bit of an interlude, we prove a basic result about quotients of
commutative rings by products of ideals that are pairwise relatively prime. This result has
applications in number theory and in the structure theorem for finitely generated modules
over a PID, which will be presented later.
Given two ideals a and b of a ring A, we define the ideal ab as the set of all finite sums
of the form
a1b1 + · · · + akbk, ai ∈ a, bi ∈ b.
The reader should check that ab is indeed an ideal. Observe that ab ⊆ a and ab ⊆ b, so that
ab ⊆ a ∩ b.
In general equality does not hold. However if
a + b = A,
then we have
ab = a ∩ b.
This is because there is some a ∈ a and some b ∈ b such that
a + b = 1,
so for every x ∈ a ∩ b, we have
x = xa + xb,
which shows that x ∈ ab. Ideals a and b of A that satisfy the condition a + b = A are
sometimes said to be comaximal.
1132 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
We define the homomorphism ϕ: A → A/a × A/b by
ϕ(x) = (xa, xb),
where xa is the equivalence class of x modulo a (resp. xb is the equivalence class of x modulo
b). Recall that the ideal a defines the equivalence relation ≡a on A given by
x ≡a y iff x − y ∈ a,
and that A/a is the quotient ring of equivalence classes xa, where x ∈ A, and similarly for
A/b. Sometimes, we also write x ≡ y (mod a) for x ≡a y.
Clearly, the kernel of the homomorphism ϕ is a ∩ b. If we assume that a + b = A, then
Ker (ϕ) = a ∩ b = ab, and because ϕ has a constant value on the equivalence classes modulo
ab, the map ϕ induces a quotient homomorphism
θ : A/ab → A/a × A/b.
Because Ker (ϕ) = ab, the homomorphism θ is injective. The Chinese Remainder Theorem
says that θ is an isomorphism.
Theorem 32.14. Given a commutative ring A, let a and b be any two ideals of A such that
a + b = A. Then, the homomorphism θ : A/ab → A/a × A/b is an isomorphism.
Proof. We already showed that θ is injective, so we need to prove that θ is surjective. We
need to prove that for any y, z ∈ A, there is some x ∈ A such that
x ≡ y (mod a)
x ≡ z (mod b).
Since a + b = A, there exist some a ∈ a and some b ∈ b such that
a + b = 1.
If we let
x = az + by,
then we have
x ≡a by ≡a (1 − a)y ≡a y − ay ≡a y,
and similarly
x ≡b az ≡b (1 − b)z ≡b z − bz ≡b z,
which shows that x = az + by works.
Theorem 32.14 can be generalized to any (finite) number of ideals.
32.2. THE CHINESE REMAINDER THEOREM 1133
Theorem 32.15. (Chinese Remainder Theorem) Given a commutative ring A, let a1, . . . , an
be any n ≥ 2 ideals of A such that ai + aj = A for all i 6 = j. Then, the homomorphism
θ : A/a1 · · · an → A/a1 × · · · × A/an is an isomorphism.
Proof. The map θ : A/a1 ∩ · · · ∩ an → A/a1 × · · · × A/an is induced by the homomorphism
ϕ: A → A/a1 × · · · × A/an given by
ϕ(x) = (xa1
, . . . , xan
).
Clearly, Ker (ϕ) = a1 ∩ · · · ∩ an, so θ is well-defined and injective. We need to prove that
a1 ∩ · · · ∩ an = a1 · · · an
and that θ is surjective. We proceed by induction. The case n = 2 is Theorem 32.14. By
induction, assume that
a2 ∩ · · · ∩ an = a2 · · · an.
We claim that
a1 + a2 · · · an = A.
Indeed, since a1 + ai = A for i = 2, . . . , n, there exist some ai ∈ a1 and some bi ∈ ai such
that
ai + bi = 1, i = 2, . . . , n,
and by multiplying these equations, we get
a + b2 · · · bn = 1,
where a is a sum of terms each containing some aj as a factor, so a ∈ a1 and b2 · · · bn ∈
a2 · · · an, which shows that
a1 + a2 · · · an = A,
as claimed. It follows that
a1 ∩ a2 ∩ · · · ∩ an = a1 ∩ (a2 · · · an) = a1a2 · · · an.
Let us now prove that θ is surjective by induction. The case n = 2 is Theorem 32.14. Let
x1, . . . , xn be any n ≥ 3 elements of A. First, applying Theorem 32.14 to a1 and a2 · · · an,
we can find y1 ∈ A such that
y1 ≡ 1 (mod a1)
y1 ≡ 0 (mod a2 · · · an).
By the induction hypothesis, we can find y2, . . . , yn ∈ A such that for all i, j with 2 ≤ i, j ≤ n,
yi ≡ 1 (mod ai)
yi ≡ 0 (mod aj ), j 6 = i.
1134 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
We claim that
x = x1y1 + x2y2 + · · · + xnyn
works. Indeed, using the above congruences, for i = 2, . . . , n, we get
x ≡ x1y1 + xi (mod ai), (∗)
but since a2 · · · an ⊆ ai
for i = 2, . . . , n and y1 ≡ 0 (mod a2 · · · an), we have
x1y1 ≡ 0 (mod ai), i = 2, . . . , n
and equation (∗) reduces to
x ≡ xi (mod ai), i = 2, . . . , n.
For i = 1, we get
x ≡ x1 (mod a1),
therefore
x ≡ xi (mod ai), i = 1, . . . , n.
proving surjectivity.
The classical version of the Chinese Remainder Theorem is the case where A = Z and
where the ideals ai are defined by n pairwise relatively prime integers m1, . . . , mn. By the
Bezout identity, since mi and mj are relatively prime whenever i 6 = j, there exist some
ui
, uj ∈ Z such that uimi + ujmj = 1, and so miZ + mjZ = Z. In this case, we get an
isomorphism
Z/(m1 · · · mn)Z ≈
nY
i=1
Z/miZ.
In particular, if m is an integer greater than 1 and
m =
Y
i
p
r
i
i
is its factorization into prime factors, then
Z/mZ ≈
Y
i
Z/pr
i
iZ.
In the previous situation where the integers m1, . . . , mn are pairwise relatively prime, if
we write m = m1 · · · mn and m0i = m/mi
for i = 1 . . . , n, then mi and m0i
are relatively
prime, and so m0i has an inverse modulo mi
. If ti
is such an inverse, so that
m0i
ti ≡ 1 (mod mi),
32.2. THE CHINESE REMAINDER THEOREM 1135
then it is not hard to show that for any a1, . . . , an ∈ Z,
x = a1t1m01 + · · · + antnm0n
satisfies the congruences
x ≡ ai (mod mi), i = 1, . . . , n.
Theorem 32.15 can be used to characterize rings isomorphic to finite products of quotient
rings. Such rings play a role in the structure theorem for torsion modules over a PID.
Given n rings A1, . . . , An, recall that the product ring A = A1 × · · · × An is the ring in
which addition and multiplication are defined componenwise. That is,
(a1, . . . , an) + (b1, . . . , bn) = (a1 + b1, . . . , an + bn)
(a1, . . . , an) · (b1, . . . , bn) = (a1b1, . . . , anbn).
The additive identity is 0A = (0, . . . , 0) and the multiplicative identity is 1A = (1, . . . , 1).
Then, for i = 1, . . . , n, we can define the element ei ∈ A as follows:
ei = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0),
where the 1 occurs in position i. Observe that the following properties hold for all i, j =
1, . . . , n:
e
2
i = ei
eiej = 0, i 6 = j
e1 + · · · + en = 1A.
Also, for any element a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈ A, we have
eia = (0, . . . , 0, ai
, 0, . . . , 0) = pri(a),
where pri
is the projection of A onto Ai
. As a consequence
Ker (pri) = (1A − ei)A.
Definition 32.3. Given a commutative ring A, a direct decomposition of A is a sequence
(b1, . . . , bn) of ideals in A such that there is an isomorphism A ≈ A/b1 × · · · × A/bn.
The following theorem gives useful conditions characterizing direct decompositions of a
ring.
Theorem 32.16. Let A be a commutative ring and let (b1, . . . , bn) be a sequence of ideals
in A. The following conditions are equivalent:
(a) The sequence (b1, . . . , bn) is a direct decomposition of A.
1136 CHAPTER 32. UFD’S, NOETHERIAN RINGS, HILBERT’S BASIS THEOREM
(b) There exist some elements e1, . . . , en of A such that
e
2
i = ei
eiej = 0, i 6 = j
e1 + · · · + en = 1A,
and bi = (1A − ei)A, for i, j = 1, . . . , n.
(c) We have bi + bj = A for all i 6 = j, and b1 · · · bn = (0).
(d) We have bi + bj = A for all i 6 = j, and b1 ∩ · · · ∩ bn = (0).
Proof. Assume (a). Since we have an isomorphism A ≈ A/b1 × · · · × A/bn, we may identify
A with A/b1 × · · · × A/bn, and bi with Ker (pri). Then, e1, . . . , en are the elements defined
just before Definition 32.3. As noted, bi = Ker (pri) = (1A − ei)A. This proves (b).
Assume (b). Since bi = (1A − ei)A and A is a ring with unit 1A, we have 1A − ei ∈ bi
for i = 1, . . . , n. For all i 6 = j, we also have ei(1A − ej ) = ei − eiej = ei
, so (because bj
is an
ideal), ei ∈ bj
, and thus, 1A = 1A − ei + ei ∈ bi + bj
, which shows that bi + bj = A for all
i 6 = j. Furthermore, for any xi ∈ A, with 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we have
nY
i=1
xi(1A − ei) = 
nY
i=1
xi

nY

(1A − ei)
=

nY
i=1
xi
 (1A −
nX
i=1
ei)
= 0,
which proves that b1 · · · bn = (0). Thus, (c) holds.
The equivalence of (c) and (d) follows from the proof of Theorem 32.15.
The fact that (c) implies (a) is an immediate consequence of Theorem 32.15.
Here is example of Theorem 32.16. Take the commutative ring of residue classes mod 30,
namely
A := Z/30Z = {i}
29
i=0.
Let
b1 = 2Z/30Z := {2i}
