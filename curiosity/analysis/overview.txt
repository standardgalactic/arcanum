**Abstract**

Curiosity is like wanting to know more inside you. It keeps going and doesn’t stop easily. Maybe it helps us make better pictures in our minds about everything that changes around us. Because curiosity is so important in our lives, there are many ideas trying to explain how we do it. One idea says curiosity is the push to get missing bits of info that help us understand the world better. Another idea says it’s like wanting to make simpler and clearer pictures in our mind about everything.

Please note that Nigerian Pijin English can vary widely, so this translation aims to capture the general essence rather than specific dialectical nuances.

**1 Introduction**

Human beings must manage uncertainty and be ready for change to do well in a complex and changing world [1]. For this reason, we always keep learning new things so we can have the right picture of how the world works [2, 3]. Sometimes people look for information because they want something from it. This could be money or respect [4]. But the main reason why people like to learn things just for fun is called curiosity [1, 5, 6]. Some computer models show that curiosity might have come about so we can do better in places where everything changes quickly [7]. Also, research has shown that humans want to know things even if it takes a lot of effort or the information doesn't seem useful right away [8, 9, 10, 11]. So, finding out new things just because is fun and rewarding.

Curiosity helps us do many things every day. That's why different people have come up with ideas to explain how we use curiosity. The information gap theory says that being curious means wanting to know the missing pieces of a picture in our head about the world [5]. In this idea, if you feel like something is missing or you're not sure about it, you want to find out more.

**2 Main Ideas**

We are trying to understand three ideas: information gap theory, compression progress theory, and conformational change theory. To do that, we need a way to map out how people think in their heads. We look at curiosity like building a big web of knowledge that keeps getting bigger.

Then, we check out these theories using numbers and graphs. In this web of knowledge, missing parts are like holes you can spot; you can measure how much you've packed information down into smaller bits; and flexibility is about how many ways your thoughts can change. 

We use data from Wikipedia to see if each idea explains how people or groups build their web of knowledge better. Our findings show that curiosity helps us fill in the missing pieces while also making our thinking more compact and flexible. We look at different situations where each idea makes sense, so we understand them better.

In summary, our study gives a new way to think about why people want to learn things just for fun by using networks, which might change or add to how curiosity is usually understood.

Na im say curiosity bring di mind to go look for info to fi close dat gap. But in another way we call it compression progress theory, na when people dey get information that make dem brain work better and use less space inside head.

Both ways talk about why people wan know things. If you open or shut gaps so di mind learn all time life, curiosity help for dat. Also, if you compress information well, you get to see important patterns in knowledge dat can be used more way. When we use less brain space for storing info, we gain power to do other things.

But trying to prove these ideas like gap theory and compression progress is hard. Because we no have good ways to model how people think. Without dem models, we no know how to turn ideas like knowledge gaps and compression progress into clear things dat can be tested in experiments.

One way show promise use network model where all knowledge made up of many connected little pieces [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. In graph learning research, people dey shown images one after the other on screen. But di people no know each image is part of a big picture network under dat [25]. From just looking at how pictures change and come, even though dem don know structure, people guess well the pattern from how things appear [20, 26, 27, 28, 29].

Importantly, we can find out what the plan behind di images was by looking at brain scans with fMRI while people look at them [27, 30]. The way we show images in these tasks is like a path dat di experimenter make for us to walk in small world of ideas and stuff. But curiosity be different; it na when you yourself choose your own path through big world of knowledge.

To check how people explore with curiosity, recent study look at how people browse Wikipedia freely. Figure 1: Connectional way to understand curiosity (A) Someone grow di brain network by exploring Wikipedia on their own. Di nodes show each page in Wikipedia. Edges show links between pages. Nodes be colored for order they dey visited. (B) Gaps in a knowledge network na we can use math and look at it from different angles. Green gap na 0-dimension hole, while blue one is 1-dimensional. (C) Compression progress try to make small ways to understand the world dat work well and apply everywhere.

We talk about how we understand and measure how flexible knowledge networks can be by counting how many ways they can move around. Imagine a small network with just three spots (nodes) and three lines (edges). A mechanical network, like those, can have different shapes or forms you can change to another through some movements.

Now, looking at natural things in the way people explore information, we find that their curiosity is linked to how they handle missing info. We use this idea to think of curiosity as a way people build up what they know. This helps us turn ideas about why people seek information into numbers and facts. 

One idea says people add more info to make sense of things by filling in the blanks left with questions or unknowns. Think of these gaps like holes in networks that we can track using special math tools for shapes (algebraic topology). On the other hand, another thought is that because our brains aren't limitless, we often drop some info that's not super important and keep what helps us make sense of things we've known or are focusing on. This idea looks at how easy it is to squish a network down without losing its key points.

From this way of looking, curiosity seems like making knowledge networks more packed with details yet simpler in form. We start asking: What makes them grow bigger and more complicated instead?

To answer that, we go beyond old stories and propose our own idea about how curiosity works by changing shapes. It says when people look for info, they create big webs of what they know, which sit inside a way of thinking about space and shape. This idea comes from studies on how the brain thinks in spaces and how info can be put into easy-to-understand shapes to handle tough tasks.

This shape thing gives curiosity a special tool—being able to think flexibly—because knowledge networks can bend or twist like clay. Some ideas stay far apart, but others can get closer or move away based on what's happening around them at the time. This bending helps us use past experiences, mix old and new info, watch out for problems, and act right in different situations. It might even help with creative thinking and finding unexpected connections.

This bending of knowledge is like how proteins change shapes; it can only happen if ideas aren't too tightly linked. If the links are too close together, they can’t bend or twist easily.

Theory of curiosity talk about wanting to be flexible and smart, which make networks grow big and complex. Now, it clear that each of these three theories come from different important reasons inside people's heads: one is to know more by filling in missing pieces; another is to find hidden patterns by understanding basic knowledge bits; and the last one is to change how we know things by mixing up our knowledge networks flexibly. Here, we check out if these ideas are true by looking at how individual and group knowledge grows using Wikipedia.

At the personal level, we make knowledge maps for 149 people based on where they go in their Wikipedia history (like what Fig. 1A show). At the group level, we look at how knowledge grows in areas like math, money talk, and language by looking at old to new concepts from years ago [47]. We see Wikipedia pages as points or "nodes" in these maps, and join them with lines if there's a link between those pages.

For personal data, we decide how the network grow by looking at when people first visit pages; for group data, it’s based on when different ideas start. To guess how knowledge might grow randomly in both sets of data, we make 25 versions where connections are changed but still keep similar patterns.

We test these three theories by comparing important features from what we actually see in knowledge maps to those in made-up ones that don't have the real connections.

1. For information gap theory: we think there should be fewer unexpected spaces or "cavities" in growing knowledge networks because people like to close gaps when they notice them.
   
2. For compression progress theory: we guess that as knowledge grows, it becomes more compressible, meaning it's easier to put into simpler forms because of the drive to find basic bits of knowing things.

3. For conformational change theory: we think growing networks should be able to change more than usual because people like to be flexible in their thinking.

By testing these ideas, we show how using knowledge maps helps us prove or create new ways to understand curiosity.

2 Results

2.1 Network growth formalism

Before checking out what the three theories say, we need to explain how they work with networks.

Imagine a graph G = (V, E) with nodes V and connections E among them. We talk about growing knowledge network as (G, s), where s is like a list that says in which order nodes join the network. For personal maps, this list comes from when people first visit pages on Wikipedia. For group maps, it’s based on when different ideas start to exist.

With N points or "nodes" in a network, we...

**Making a Sequence of Graphs**

We make a series of graphs like this:
- Start with G0
- Then have G1 inside it
- Keep adding more until we reach GN = G

In each step, Gp is just a smaller graph with the first p nodes and all their connections (q) that exist. This way of building up the graphs is called a filtration.

We use numbers to show how many nodes are in each graph as we go along.

For these series of graphs, we:
- Find hidden spaces or gaps (called topological cavities)
- Measure how much the network can be squished
- Check how flexible it is

We do this for real networks and also make up some fake ones to compare.

To check if there's a big difference between what happens in real vs. fake networks, we use special tests called non-parametric permutation tests (you can find more about these in section 5.5).

Since different networks have different sizes, we change the numbers so they fit into a range from 0 to 1. We make sure that all important points line up before finding the average for something we're interested in.

Even though we focus on these adjusted numbers, we also show what happens with the original numbers in extra material (the Supplement).

**Understanding Information Gaps**

The theory about information gaps says curiosity comes from wanting to fill holes in our knowledge about the world. 

When we think of our knowledge as networks, these missing pieces can be seen as topological cavities. We use special tools to track these.

Here's how we see it:

- **0-Dimension Cavities**: These are like separate pieces that don't connect. In real and group knowledge networks, there aren’t as many disconnected parts as in fake ones.
  
- **1-Dimension Cavities**: These look like loops or rings made of connections. Real and group networks have fewer loops than expected compared to fake ones.

- **2-Dimension Cavities**: These are spaces enclosed by triangles made of nodes connecting. As real and group networks grow, they tend to have more 3D cavities than in fake ones.

The shaded parts show how much things can vary. The purple lines show what usually happens with the fake networks.

For methodo details) [32, 33]. We follow what people done show before that even different things like how small kids start talking [49], how characters come in Dostoyevsky's books [50], and how ideas are shown in math textbooks [48] all do this thing of making and fixing up gaps. By using this way, we can see if the reason why people explore new things is because they want to fix those gaps.

In a network, except for dimension 0, you find something called a k-dimensional cavity or a k-cycle. This is like an empty space made from (k + 1)-cliques, where cliques are when all members in a group of k + 1 people are connected to each other. The k-th Betti curve keeps track of how many k-cycles you find as the network grows. For cycles with dimension 0, they just mean parts of the network that don’t connect (Fig. 2A). Cycles in dimensions 1 and 2 look like loops (Fig. 2D) or pockets (Fig. 2G).

Thinking about information gap theory, we guess that real knowledge networks have fewer gaps than other made-up ones (null model networks) that are similar but with mixed connections. To check this guess, we use something called persistent homology for both individual and group knowledge networks in dimensions 0, 1, and 2.

We find out that the number of separate parts (0-cycles) goes up as people's knowledge grows. This happens faster in made-up networks than in real ones (Fig. 2B). For groups' knowledge, we see more separate parts at first, then fewer, both in real and made-up networks, but with different numbers at their highest point (Fig. 2C). In both sets of data, for a long time while things grow, the Betti curves for real networks stay lower than those for the made-up ones.

In dimensions 1 and 2, we see more cycles as people's knowledge grows (Fig. 2D-I). This could be because making new links can create new gaps, which makes it hard to keep track of and fix gaps among many things. Supporting information gap theory, fewer 1-cycles grow in real networks than made-up ones (Fig. 2E,F). But unlike the theory, more 2-cycles grow faster in real networks than in made-up ones (Fig. 2H,I). This big growth of pocket-like spaces might mean there’s another reason why knowledge gets bigger and more complex.

All Betti curves for real data are different from those in the made-up model data (pperm < 0.001), as shown by testing many times.

In short, looking at both individual and group knowledge networks, what we find says that information gap theory explains how different topics grow then connect together, and how loops within specific topics grow then get fixed. But why bigger pocket-like spaces exist for so long isn’t explained by this theory, making us think about other reasons people learn things.

To translate this technical text into Nigerian Pidgin English while maintaining clarity:

The idea behind "compression progress theory" is that we are driven by curiosity to make our understanding of the world more efficient and detailed. We think about how we understand things like a network of knowledge, using ideas from information science and how networks work.

To see how well we can squeeze or compress this network, imagine walking through it randomly step-by-step, noting each point (or node) you visit. The speed at which this walk gives us new info is measured by something called entropy, H(x).

Now picture dividing the points into groups or clusters. This changes our sequence from x to y by replacing each point with its group number. If we look at how much information about the original sequence (x) is in the grouped one (y), we use mutual information, I(x, y). When every point has its own group, this info level is high, matching the original entropy. But if all points are lumped into one big group, there's no new info.

We can always find a middle ground—grouping that reduces the amount of new info we need as much as possible at different scales. Network compressibility means how much we reduce the information rate on average across these scales.

Looking at how knowledge networks grow, they often become more compressible than other similar but shuffled networks. When groups work together to build a shared knowledge network, they show a small trend toward better-than-expected compression. The shaded areas in the figures are just showing normal error ranges, and those purple lines show average values for these shuffled networks.

Note: Nigerian Pidgin English doesn't typically use technical terms from information theory, so some concepts have been simplified to match common usage.

We think if you look at how knowledge networks grow, they might be easier to squeeze down than other similar-looking random networks we can make by switching around their connections. So, we tested this idea by seeing how easy it was to compress the different bits of these growing knowledge networks.

We found out that as these networks get bigger, they do become easier to squash down. At every step of their growth, and just like we thought, people's individual networks could be squashed more than expected (see Fig 3C). This is also true for big group knowledge networks, but not by much. In the beginning stages, the difference between real-world networks and random ones was clearer, but later they started to look alike (Fig 3D).

Using a special kind of test called non-parametric permutation testing, we found out that both individual and group network squishiness were really different from those made up at random (pperm < 0.001). This is important proof for what we call compression progress theory.

According to this idea, when people are curious, they like things to be simple in their heads. For big groups, it might be that everyone's different ideas and skills make every detail important and hard to squash down. Also, groups don't have the same thinking limits as individuals do.

2.4
Change Shape Theory

If you're just following information gap theory when being curious, you want to know more and cover everything. But if you’re only looking at compression progress theory, you're trying to find hidden patterns in how things are connected.

Neither of these ways lets a person keep up with how complicated the world gets as new mysteries show up. Importantly, both ideas tell us when we should add or drop info but don't value what we already know.

Previous studies say that being curious isn't just about learning more or forgetting stuff; it's also about thinking over what you already know [14, 31]. Following Zurn and others [40], we think this means moving ideas around in your mind. We see curiosity as making a network of knowledge where things are firm but can still bend when needed.

Firmness and bending come from how objects behave in real space. So, like some studies on thinking maps (see extra info), we guess that these networks sit in real space with lots of ways they can change shape [42]. We check this flexibility by seeing if the network can twist or turn easily.

Wi bin talk about how networks inna di mind work. Sometimes, if a network is too tight, it can have a problem; this means we need to add more space for it to breathe. If the number of ways to arrange or change the network (we call this "degrees of freedom") come out negative, then we know the network too strict and needs more room.

When we see this happen, wi jus add one more dimension—like going from a line (1D) to a plane (2D), or maybe even a 3D space. So, when wi see that a new part of the network can't fit nice in di current space, wi just make da space bigger.

Wi think people's minds be flexible and like to change how we think based on new things we learn. We checked this by seeing how easy or hard it is for networks representing what we know (individually or together) to change their shape without getting stuck.

We found out that when a person thinks, they need more room to change how they see things than random networks. But when many people think together, it's harder to tell if they be flexible compared to the random ones, but there still be some difference clear as day.

Wi believe this shows we like to rethink what we know with new info. Collective thoughts (like when a whole group thinks) not so quick to change big time over long times. Maybe in future studies, wi can look at how different parts of these networks can change shape in di future or during big changes in thinking.

**Figure 5:**
We talk about how people's minds be like a network where some ideas and connections are fixed while others can move around depending on the situation. This movement make it easier for humans to think new things when we get new information. We call this flexibility "degrees of freedom." In a space with di number (d) of dimensions, wi count how many ways we can change or arrange the network with p points and q lines using di formula: DoFC = dp−q −d(d+1)/2. Starting from 1D, wi calculate how flexible this setup be.

For filas (filtrations) of growing knowledge networks. If DoFC have negative value, it mean we got self-stress. We fix this by adding 1 to d. In example when nodes 3 and 6 join network, it become too tight with self-stress. So, first dimensionality go up from 1 to 2, then again from 2 to 3.

For individual knowledge networks, they need more dimensions and be more flexible than null model networks. But collective knowledge networks don't have more dimensions or flexibility like the null models. Shaded areas in B-E show errors.

Discussion:
In this work, we talk 'bout curiosity as building a growing knowledge network. We use tools from network science to check some ideas for curiosity like information gap theory and compression progress theory. Information gap theory say that curiosity make us want to get bits of knowledge dat fill gaps in our understanding. Compression progress theory say that curiosity is the drive to find out hidden organization of world. We see information gaps as top holes (cavities) in growing knowledge networks, and we check how easy it be to compress using network compressibility. The two ideas help us look at curiosity from diﬀerent angles; information gap theory say new info fill knowledge gaps while compression progress theory suggest new info make essential parts of knowledge simpler. But dem ideas only tell how knowledge networks get denser and simple, not when they become big and complex. So we build on a recent idea to develop the conformational change theory of curiosity. We think that knowledge networks be in Euclidean space, let concepts move freely with one another. We see curiosity as building mechanically flexible knowledge networks. Formally, we measure how flexible ideas can be by counting the number of ways the network can change shape. Through our work, we look at both big and small things to check evidence for each idea. On different levels, we find out when each theory make sense, so we know their special benefits.

Information gap theory and topological cavities in knowledge networks. Information gap theory say humans only be comfortable with some amount of not knowing about world. When you see a little bit of new info that you didn't know before, it show there's a hole (gap) in what you know, making uncertainty too much to handle. This make us want more info to fill the gaps and solve the unknown. In this work, we see gaps as top holes in growing knowledge networks and watch how they change in dimensions 0, 1, and 2. Each dimension got its own special thing.

To translate this complex academic text into Nigerian Pidgin English (Nigerian Pijin), we'll simplify the language while maintaining the core ideas. Here's a version in Nigerian Pijin:

---

In topological terms, gaps can be different sizes: zero-dimensional gaps are like separate pieces that aren't connected; one-dimensional gaps look like holes or loops; and two-dimensional gaps look like pockets or voids. As people learn more, they find more of these gaps. This means even when we know a lot, there's still a lot we don't discover.

For gaps of size zero (when separate pieces are not linked), adding just one link makes them connected. Groups can add these links easier than individuals because they work across different fields and try to connect diverse knowledge areas. It’s important to note that people or groups tend to have fewer small and medium-sized gaps compared to random networks, showing we actively try to fill those gaps.

When it comes to more complex theories like information gap theory, this helps explain why smaller gaps (0 and 1 dimensions) don't grow much. But for bigger gaps (2 dimensions), something else might be going on, both for individuals and groups.

Now let's talk about compression progress theory, which says our brains need to store lots of info in a smart way because we can’t keep everything separately. When people learn more, they find ways to link ideas that make them easier to remember. This means learning is not just adding information but also making it more manageable. However, when groups gather knowledge together, they don't have the same limits as individuals and store detailed info differently.

In summary, this theory works well for individual learning but might need a different explanation for how groups learn and share knowledge.

**Conformational Change Theory an’ Knowledge Networks**

Dis theory we call "conformational change theory" about curiosity be different from others. It based on two big ideas.

1. **First Big Idea:** We think people keep knowledge in their brain like a network, kinda like a web of thoughts.
2. **Second Big Idea:** We believe these networks live inside a space where they can move around in many ways, like physical things that bend and stretch. This idea come from how we understand both physical space (like maps) and ideas.

From studies on how people navigate spaces, we see our brains make mental maps with nodes—these nodes represent places or concepts. Each node know its neighbors by distance and angles. When we think about abstract stuff, like concepts not tied to real-world objects, similar patterns show up in brain activity.

Now, when we talk about "conformational flexibility," we mean how many ways these knowledge networks can change their shape. We find that as people learn more, their knowledge webs get bigger and have even more possibilities to reshape than expected.

**Theory Explained:**

According to this theory, when a person's knowledge gets too crowded, it feels like the web is squeezed. This "squeeze" or stress happens often in how individuals store knowledge compared to random setups (null model data).

This idea fits with the curiosity theory because it suggests people reshape their understanding based on new experiences and contexts. But when many people build knowledge together, we don’t see these changes as much. Maybe 'cause big groups work over longer time, and big shifts in thinking might not be visible right away.

**Curiosity Types:**

In psychology, they talk about different ways people get curious. There are two main kinds:

- **Perceptual Curiosity:** When you want to see or feel something more because it's interesting, but once you have enough, you stop wanting it.
  
- **Epistemic Curiosity:** This is a broader kind of curiosity for understanding things, not just seeing them. It’s divided into:
  - **Specific Curiosity:** Wanting to know exactly about one thing or solve a puzzle in your mind.
  
So we use computer methods to study these ideas and understand how people grow their knowledge differently.

**Diversive Curiosity and Knowledge Networks**

Diversive curiosity is like wanting to know many different things, not just one. It's about getting a wide range of knowledge. There are different ways people show they want to learn new stuff. Many tests try to measure this in people using questionnaires, but these can't really track how curiosity changes over time.

Our idea is to see curiosity as building a network of what we know. We have special ways to measure this, like looking at gaps, how much info you need to store, and flexibility in learning. These methods help us understand how people seek information over time, whether it's in experiments or real life. Future work includes linking these measurements with different types of curiosity and adding new ideas from network theory.

**Curiosity and AI**

The ways we measure curiosity can also be used for studying artificial intelligence. For example, compressibility was first thought of as a way to help machines learn better on their own. We suggest other measures like the number of gaps in knowledge networks, how much you can squeeze down information, and flexibility in learning paths that might guide AI.

Out of these three ways to measure curiosity, only one is easy and cheap to calculate: counting flexible parts of what we know. In machine learning, getting information helps achieve a goal, which usually means getting some kind of reward. Machines need to find the right balance between using known methods (exploitation) and trying new ones (exploration).

In many real-world tasks, rewards don't come often or at all. Curiosity can help machines explore better and do their jobs well even when there are no clear rewards.

**Research Ideas**

Designing curiosity-based ways to reward machines is a big area for more research. Insights from how humans learn might help in designing these systems.

**Methods We Used**

There are some important points about our methods. In math, usually, people order connections (edges) by importance when making networks, not the parts connected (nodes). They start with the strongest connection and work their way down. But we rank parts instead of connections to see how knowledge grows. At each step, we add a part and all its links.

**Nigerian Pijin Translation**

Diversive curiosity mean yu wan know many ting, no just one. It about get big range of knowledge. People show diya want learn in different ways. Many test try measure this in people using questionnaires but dem can’t really track how curiosity change time.

We think curiosity like build network what we know. We have special way to measure dis: look for gaps, how much info need store, and flexibility in learning. Dis help us understand how people seek information ova time, whether in experiment or real life. Future work include link these measurement with different type of curiosity and add new ideas from network theory.

**Curiosity and AI**

Ways we measure curiosity can also use for study artificial intelligence. For example, compressibility first think as way to help machine learn better ownself. We suggest other ways like count gaps in knowledge networks, how much you squeeze down info, and flexibility in learning paths dat might guide AI.

Out of dis three way to measure curiosity, only one easy and cheap calculate: count flexible parts what we know. In machine learning, get information help reach goal, usually mean get some reward. Machines need find right balance between use known method (exploitation) and try new ones (exploration).

In many real-life job, reward no come often or at all. Curiosity can help machines explore better and do job well even when no clear reward.

**Conclusion**

We think of curiosity like making a big map of what we know to look at three ideas: information gap idea, compression progress idea, and change shape idea. We use networks to make these ideas clear because they are mostly thought of in words. Information gaps show up as holes in the map, how much we can squish our knowledge is about how compressible it is, and flexibility—like change shape idea talks about—is counting how many ways things can move around. We look at data from Wikipedia to make these maps for people and groups.

We find out that as more things get added to our knowledge map, the number of unknowns go up, meaning we have more things we don't know. But also, even though there are more gaps, we see less broken parts or holes (like 0-dimentional cavities) in these maps than expected, and fewer loops or circles made by connections (1-dimensional cavities). This means that the "gaps" that information gap idea talks about might be best seen as empty spots and circles in a map. 

We also notice that people's knowledge maps can be squished more than we thought, showing us that when we learn new things, we like to make simple mental pictures of the world. Also, as these maps grow, they become easier for changes—meaning change shape idea is still important.

Our discoveries show us that curiosity is a mix where learning new stuff helps fill in the blanks and makes our brain's map both simpler and more bendy. We bring a fresh way to look at how we learn naturally by using network ideas that might help make sense of it all.

**Method**

**5.1 Data**

**5.1.1 Knowledge Networks by Individuals**

We build knowledge networks for people using data from "Knowledge Networks Over Time" (KNOT) study [31, 72, 73]. This data include Wikipedia browsing histories of 149 people (121 women, 26 men, 2 others) collected between October 2017 and July 2018. When they gave the data, these people were between 18.21 and 65.24 years old (average age 25.05, standard deviation 6.99); 6.71% said they were African American/Black, 25.50% said they were Asian, 5.37% said they were Hispanic/Latino, 49.66% said they were White, 5.37% said they were Multiracial, 5.37% said they were Other, and 2.01% did not give racial or ethnic information.

Every evening for 21 days, these people were asked to open a browser and go to wikipedia.org. They were told to search for information for 15 minutes without any rules on how to move from one page to another. At the end of each session, they used tracking software (Timing), already installed on their computers or laptops, to save and upload their browsing histories.

We see every page visited by a person as nodes in a knowledge network. Edges between these nodes are based on hyperlinks. Past work has shown that pages connected by hyperlinks tend to be more similar than those not connected [31]. So we add an undirected and unweighted edge between Page 1 and Page 2 if either Page 1 links to Page 2 or vice versa. You don’t need hyperlinks to go both ways for an edge to exist between two nodes. We check for hyperlinks based on how Wikipedia looked on August 1, 2019, and we use code from the wikinet package for building networks [47]. Each node (or page) in the browsing data has a number that shows when it was visited. For every person, the nodes, edges, and order of visiting are used to build a growing knowledge network.

**5.1.2 Knowledge Networks Built Collectively**

As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is like a big storehouse of knowledge gathered over thousands of years by people working together. Building on past work, we make specific networks for different subjects by taking parts of the larger Wikipedia network [47]. Information in Wikipedia is arranged in layers, which helps us find articles about certain topics. We use this structure to build knowledge networks for thirty areas: abstract algebra, accounting, biophysics, Boolean algebra, calculus, cognitive science, commutative algebra, dynamical systems and diﬀerential equations, dy-

Translating complex academic content into Nigerian Pidgin (also known as Nigerian Patois or Broken English) involves simplifying concepts and using common phrases understood by speakers of this dialect. Here's a simplified version:

---

Namical system, earth science, economics, education, energy, evolution biology, geology, geometry, group theory, immunology, linear algebra, linguistics, meteorology, molecular biology, number theory, optics, philosophy language, law, mind, science, sociology, software engineering. All pages under a topic are nodes in its network. Like for molecular biology, there are pages like ‘allele’, ‘lymphocyte’, and ‘antibody’ as nodes.

Edges (links) between these nodes make the network. Articles tell us when each concept was first known; this helps order how the graph grows over time. More details on making networks can be found in a book by Ju et al. [47].

**Finding Holes in Networks**

To find holes of different sizes in a network, we build something called a simplicial complex. A graph has nodes and edges, but a simplicial complex is made up of simpler shapes (simplices) that show relationships among sets of nodes.

- A 0-simplex is just one node.
- A 1-simplex is an edge connecting two nodes.
- A 2-simplex is like a filled triangle made from three connected nodes.

These shapes follow the rule that any smaller group inside them is also a shape. For example, a filled triangle (2-simplex) has edges (1-simplices) and corners (0-simplices).

In graph terms, a k-simplex matches with a fully connected group of (k+1) nodes. To make a simplicial complex from a graph, we use these shapes for all the groups in the graph that are fully connected.

A topological hole in this structure is found when there's an empty space formed by these shapes. It depends on its boundary – what edges or smaller shapes form around it.

The boundary of a shape (σ) is made up of its smaller faces (∂σ). For a group of shapes K, we find the boundary by combining their boundaries without overlap.

A set of shapes that makes an empty boundary is called a cycle. But not all cycles are holes – some just fill space inside bigger shapes. We need to tell apart real holes from those that are part of something bigger.

Certainly! Here's a translation of the provided text into Nigerian Pidgin English:

We be talk about equivalence. Two k-cycles K1 and K2 fit equivalent if when you do K1 ΔK2, it become boundary for some (k + 1)-simplices collection. When we dey talk about homology, we dey count how many non-equivalent cycles of different sizes in a clique complex we have. People mostly just call them cycles for short.

The graph filtration from Eq. 1 bring another related filtration of clique complexes: X(G0) inside X(G1), inside and so on until X(GN) which equal to X(G).

In every stage of the filtration, we add one node and then replace all cliques that come up from adding this new node with relevant simplices. Some new simplices bring cavities while others shut old ones down. This equivalence thing help us calculate persistent homology by tracking how each cavity move from when it first start to when it finally get fill up by higher simplices. At any point p in the filtration, the k-th Betti number βk(p) count how many active cavities we have of dimension k. We then define the k-th Betti curve as sequence {βk(p)}N from p=0. We use Ripser.py package in Python to do this persistent homology for all knowledge networks.

For more understanding about topological data analysis, you should read Refs. [32, 33, 34, 75, 76, 77].

5.3
Calculating Network Compressibility

To guess how much we can squeeze a network down, we look at a binary graph Gp with p nodes and q edges, which be like a symmetric adjacency matrix M in Rp×p. A message about how the network look like can go to any receiver by making it into random walk x = (x1, x2, ...). This walk come up when you move from one node to its neighbor just like chance.

So for a random walk on Gp, chance of moving from node i to node j be Pij = Mij / Σj Mij. Because the random walk follow Markov process, how fast this message pass information (or its entropy) dey be:

H(x) = − ∑i πi ∑j Pij log Pij.

Here, πi show stationary distribution meaning long-time probability that the walk get to there.

At node i, it's given by πi = P<sub>j</sub>M<sub>ij</sub>/2q.

Assigning clusters to nodes leads to a simplified sequence y = (y1, y2, ..., ) where yt is the cluster with node xt. The number of clusters n can define how we describe the network’s scale S = 1 − n<sup>−1</sup><sub>p</sub>. For instance, when n = p, the network is described in small details at a fine-grained scale S = 1/p; but when n = 1, it's described at the largest possible scale S = 1.

In general, this simplified sequence y isn't Markovian. Still, we can use Eq. 4 to find an upper limit on its information rate. At every level of description, there's a way to group nodes that lowers this upper bound. After finding these best ways to group across all levels, we get a curve R(S), showing the lowest possible upper bound on the info rate as a function of scale S. The network’s compressibility C is then the average drop in R(S) at every level:

C = H(x) − 1/p ∑<sub>S</sub> R(S).

Visually, this is like looking at the area above the curve R(S) and below the original random walk's entropy H(x). For a graph filtration as in Eq. 1, we change notation and define the compressibility curve as {C(p)} from N to 0, where p is the number of nodes in subgraph G<sub>p</sub>.

5.4 Computing Mechanical Network Features

Imagine we have nodes V = {1, ..., N} placed in d dimensions. Each node i in V has a spot in space xi in Rd. By itself, this system has dN ways to move because each node can go wherever it wants. If we link these nodes with edges from set E ⊆ V × V, then each edge e<sub>ij</sub> ∈ E between nodes i and j takes away one way they can move along the line of the edge. Each edge creates a rule that keeps the distance between the nodes fixed:

(x<sub>i</sub> − x<sub>j</sub>)⊤(x<sub>i</sub> − x<sub>j</sub>) = constant.

To make it simpler, we can change this by taking the total derivative of both sides and dividing by 2:

(x<sub>i</sub> − x<sub>j</sub>)⊤(d<sub>x</sub><sub>i</sub> − d<sub>x</sub><sub>j</sub>) = 0.

This means that the movement between nodes i and j should be zero along the line connecting them.

To translate this technical passage into Nigerian Pidgin (also known as Nigerian Patois), it's important to simplify and adapt the language while maintaining clarity. Here’s an attempt:

---

Aka when we say edge point from node xj to xi, na only the nodes go move side by side the edge so that edge no change in size.

If we gather all these rules for every edge in E, then we get |E| number of rules on how the nodes should move. If all these rules are different from each other, then the total way things can move is reduced to dN − E.

Among all these ways to move, d(d+1)/2 be like moving together as a whole without changing distances between any pair of nodes. So, the number of ways we can change shape, na called DoFC, and it dey calculated by:

DoFC = dN − E − d(d + 1) / 2.

This idea first come from Maxwell in 1864.

There be many important changes to this idea too. One change talk about what happen when rules no fit well together. This can happen if we put too many edges in a network. For example, if we have N = 4 nodes and we place every pair of them connected with an edge like E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)}, na a total of |E| = 6 edges. Here, the way to change shape go negative: [(2 × 4) − 6] − 3 = −1.

For network to have less than zero ways to change shape, there must be pattern where some edges get squeezed and others stretch, like carrying load within them with balanced forces on nodes. In studying curiosity with changing shapes, we say such states of stress not nice to us. When DoFC become negative, we solve this by saying one more dimension should be added.

Recent studies show there's bias in how papers are cited—often women and minority scholars don't get as many citations as they deserve. Our team aimed to use references that better represent diversity in thoughts, contributions, gender, race, ethnicity, etc.

Firstly, we guessed the genders of authors using databases with probabilities based on names. From our sources (not counting our own work), the citation breakdown was: 16.27% female first/female last author; 11.80% male first/female last author; 19.30% female first/male last author; and 52.63% male first/male last author.

This method has limits—it might not match actual gender identities or account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people.

Secondly, we tried to guess the racial/ethnic background of authors using similar databases. Our sources showed: 4.67% both authors are from ethnic backgrounds; 9.86% white first author/ethnic last author; 20.34% ethnic first author/white last author; and 65.12% both authors are white.

This method also has limits—it might not correctly identify racial or ethnic identity, nor account for Indigenous or mixed-race people.

We hope future work helps us do better in making science fairer.
