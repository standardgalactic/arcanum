Citation diversity statement
Recent work in a number of scientiﬁc ﬁelds has identiﬁed a bias in citation practices such that
papers by women and other minority scholars are under-cited relative to the number of such papers
in the ﬁeld [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]. Here, we sought to proactively choose references that
reﬂect the diversity of the ﬁeld in thought, form of contribution, gender, race, ethnicity, and other
factors. First, we predicted the gender of the ﬁrst and last authors of each reference using databases
that store the probability of a ﬁrst name being carried by a woman [84, 89]. By this measure (and
excluding self-citations to the ﬁrst and last authors of our current paper), our references contain
16.27% woman(ﬁrst)/woman(last), 11.80% man/woman, 19.30% woman/man, 52.63% man/man
citation categorizations.
This method is limited in that a) names, pronouns, and social media
proﬁles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity
and b) it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people. Second, we obtained
predicted racial/ethnic category of the ﬁrst and last author of each reference using databases that
store the probability of a ﬁrst and last name being carried by an author of color [90, 91].
By
this measure (and excluding self-citations), our references contain 4.67% author of color/author of
color, 9.86% white author/author of color, 20.34% author of color/white author, and 65.12% white
author/white author citation categorizations. This method is limited in that a) names, Census
entries, and Wikipedia proﬁles used to make predictions about gender may not be indicative of
racial/ethnic identity, and b) it cannot account for Indigenous and mixed-race authors, or those
who may face diﬀerential biases due to the ambiguous racialization or ethnicization of their names.
We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand how to support equitable
practices in science.
