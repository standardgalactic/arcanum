Abstract
Curiosity is an internally motivated search for information. It is enduring and open-ended,
and may have evolved to help us build accurate mental representations of our ever-changing
environments. Due to the signiﬁcant role that curiosity plays in our lives, several theoretical
constructs, such as the information gap theory and compression progress theory, have sought
to explain how we engage in its practice. According to the former, curiosity is the drive to
acquire information that is missing from our understanding of the world. According to the
latter, curiosity is the drive to construct an increasingly parsimonious mental model of the
