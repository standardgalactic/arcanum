response bias, and it kind of characterizes how fine grained or precise our memory is for different
inputs. We also have data on how difficult it was in the past to pattern separate these images.
So an independent sample of people did the task a while ago, and the performance, the stimuli with the
best performance were binned into the highest rank of ease of the next lowest performances were binned into the
next lower bins. Easier bins were assumed to take advantage of some kind of dissimilarity function in
order to form distinct memories. And so we're going to try to explain that dissimilarity or ease using
lossy compression by trying to predict the ranked bins of the stimuli using our lossiness metrics.
So what we hypothesize is that worse and more difficult pattern separation needs more resources to
retain high fidelity in order to distinguish more subtle differences, whereas better and easier
patterns separate. Yeah.
All right. And you explain to them what things kind of the same and different. I mean,
in terms of shape, pattern, color, because someone with an unbelievable memory could say,
well, I've seen, I can remember every color of Frisbee I've seen, and they're all different colors,
so I'm not seeing exactly the same image again. Some of that visual memory like that.
Yeah, yeah. That's all explained.
Yeah, that's in the instructions. They're given a bunch of practice trials kind of right before the test
phase that described to them what counts as similar, what counts as totally novel. In other versions
of the task, people are just asked to say whether it's old or novel, and there are similar findings
in that approach, too. And then for better and easier pattern separation, we think that because
it needs fewer resources, we can more aggressively lossily compress the input and be able to more
