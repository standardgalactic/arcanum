prefrontal cortex, because there is less information discarded, it can represent more types of
information that might support the flexibility of all those different types of functions. So it might
explain why some regions are more specialized for like just faces, because they have highly compressed
activity. So yeah, the take-home message is that we can try to use this approach to
try to create these models of curiosity, pattern separation, compression, and try to understand
these more like emergent behaviors from the basis of some simple local interactions. Thanks.
