and then in another session where there's a local left corner or is it across people?
This is this is across people. So yeah, what we showed within people was that when people have higher
state like sensation seeking, if you feel like you want to take some risks and you know,
like see what happens, then you tend to be more of a busybody type browsing. So that was kind of like the
longitudinal result there. Yeah. But this is yeah, you're right. This is just correlating individual
differences in this regularity parameter to individual differences in depression and anxiety,
depressed mood and anxious mood. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. So we use the full browsing session. So we're not we're not
trying within a person to fit these parameters. So we're not trying to look for I think it's a good
idea to do this. But we're not currently we're not trying to look for sections within the browsing
session that correlate more that look more like a levy flight or don't look more like we could apply
something like a hidden Markov model that is able to assign these kind of labels to different time
points. And that might be an interesting thing to try. Because in reality, none of us are purely,
you know, hunters are purely busybodies, we like switch according to our tasks. And
yeah, there's just there's a modest correlation between these styles and our personality trait
preferences. And, you know, personality traits don't define also what we're going to end up doing all
the time either. Yeah, that's a good question. So I just wanted to show that we can find something
similar in the mobile app data. Because we were looking, this was observational data, we didn't
have access to who these people were. And we also couldn't pull them for how they were feeling at any
given time. But due to the sample size, what we could do is look at national level surveys of happiness
