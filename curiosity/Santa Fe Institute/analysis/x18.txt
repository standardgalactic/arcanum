and I compressed it very aggressively, I would end up with something like this kind of blurry
reconstruction that I would then need to use to compare to new inputs in a task to decide if this
is similar or new or old. Okay, so what we want to ask here is how can compressed representation
support pattern separation? Specifically, we'll be testing, does compression explain why some memory
representations of image stimuli are easier or harder to pattern separate than others? Does compression
explain how pattern separation performance varies individually and can compression compensate for
the degradation of episodic memory with aging? Okay, so we're going to be focusing on this pattern
separation task. In the first part of the task, participants are presented with sequences of items
where they're asked to do this cover task that we don't care about, but they're just asked to judge
whether the item is indoor or outdoor. This is just meant to make them pay attention to the item and
encode it without necessarily knowing that we're going to test them on memory later. In a test phase,
on the right, participants are again presented with another sequence of images, and the key thing that
they have to do is to say whether the newly presented image is a repeat. So the stapler was in the study
phase, so it should be said that it's old. Then there's items that should be said as new because they
never saw it in the study phase, such as this paper airplane. And finally, the key pattern separation
performance metric we care about is whether they can discriminate similar inputs. So this orange frisbee
versus the blue frisbee, they need to say that it's similar to something they've seen before.
So the primary outcome variable of pattern separation performance is this Lure discrimination index,
which is the probability of answering similar given a Lure trial minus a response bias of just
answering similar like kind of habitually or willy nilly. And so yes, this correct rejection minus
