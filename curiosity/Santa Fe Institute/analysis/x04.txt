assessments on their current mood, anxiety, and feelings of sensation-seeking or risk-taking.
And then what we wanted to do was develop a model in this sample and then use the model to generalize
to this out-of-sample set of 500,000 people who we tracked. So we collaborated with the Wikimedia Foundation
to use mobile app data. And so we got around 500,000 people, which we matched for approximate
session lengths with the laboratory data to kind of try to make a more fair comparison.
As you can see by the map, these people spanned around 50 countries and also spanned 14 languages
of Wikipedia. So we thought this would be a really nice way to test the generalizability of our model.
Okay, so what is the model? Basically, again, we want to try to create a model that can generate these
styles from the hunter and the busybody style from simple principles. So we're going to be modeling
exploration using random walkers. So these are agents that we're going to be using agent-based
modeling to follow two simple rules. The first one is a parameter called reinforcement, and it'll
basically parameterize the preference for familiarity versus novelty. The second parameter is called
regularity, and it's a preference for similarity versus diversity. And I'll be talking more, I'll be
unpacking how we define these mathematically in the next slides. But with these two, just these two
preferences, we can define curious information seeking as this extended and open-ended search
process for valuable information with hidden identity and location in this network space. And
I recently read this book, actually after I did all this work, but it was a really nice kind of
consistent thought of like, instead of looking for a particular treasure or a goal that you might have
in mind, in a non-objective search diverges through the search space and finds many treasures,
all of which might be surprises. So it's kind of an undirected search to build stepping stones that can
