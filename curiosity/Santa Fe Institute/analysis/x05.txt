allow you to identify and seek future unknown novelties or interests.
Quick question from the peanut gallery. Yeah, so I'm just thinking of what I do. I'm sure
everybody's thinking of that right now. I tend to go deep on one topic for, I don't know, maybe even
all 20 minutes. And then I'll switch to something very different. So it's kind of like a two-level
thing out of a high level, very, very different kinds of things, but then each one is relatively deep.
It seems like that's not going to be captured by these, or? It will be. Okay, good.
So these parameters, because we can parameter, so the extremes of the parameters will be this
hunter-like very local search and a busybody very disconnected search, but in between there will
definitely be more of these, you know, switching between local exploration and then kind of going to a
new patch of interest, I guess. Thanks. Do you record a length of time that people engage with that
particular place and also the length of the entry or, you know? Yeah, that's a great question.
So that's definitely, so I should be clear that what we are interested in is if people are interested
in seeking information on the page, not necessarily if they internalized it or they learned about it or
they memorized it or even if they read the whole page. We really cared about if they had that
initial interest to like go into the page and see what was in there. But that said, we do have
timestamps of how long they spent on each page. I think that would be worth modeling in the future.
In this model, we don't account for that. We just account for the network created by whether they
visited the page or not. And if you do some kind of time analysis in the future, you should also take
into account the length of the entry. Yeah, definitely, because yeah, those will be
confounded. Yeah. And what's also nice is it's not just novelty seeking, it's kind of being able
