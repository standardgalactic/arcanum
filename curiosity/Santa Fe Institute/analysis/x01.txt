this kind of active exploration. It's important to study curiosity for several reasons. But the
way we try to understand curiosity is by defining it as a practice of creating your own distinct
knowledge network based on individually different architectural styles. And I'll go into what this
means more concretely in the next slides. But in general, there's two architectural styles
I'll be focusing on in this talk. The first one's a hunter that seeks similar information through
kind of more targeted exploration with depth, but also resulting in more homogenous and constrained
browsing. The other is a busybody that seeks dissimilar information, which allows it to get more broad
and diverse exploration, but it can be more fragmented and disconnected. So the reason why we
care about trying to quantify the behavior of curiosity is because people tend to learn more when they're
curious, they might better assess the novelty and quality of false information. Curiosity is also
associated with well being, creativity, empathy, perseverance, and a lot of other traits we care
about. And it also is a marker for psychopathology in depression and anxiety as it declines.
So let me talk a little bit more about what I mean by studying curiosity as generating these knowledge
networks. So we'll be wanting to understand how we can develop a complex system model that generates
these architectural styles from simple local principles. And then we're going to ask if we can
develop this model in a laboratory setting and then replicate it in a really large data set of a global
readership. And finally, we want to ask when do we express certain styles of curiosity?
Okay. So by a knowledge network, I just mean a network with nodes defined as Wikipedia pages that
an individual visits and edges as a presence or absence of a hyperlink between the pages. What this
ends up doing is it allows us to track browsing data as kind of this temporal thread through the
