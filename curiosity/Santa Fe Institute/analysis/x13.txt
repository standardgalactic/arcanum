some experiences while like shoveling aside, and what I'll be arguing is like a form of compression,
compressing away others in order to update kind of this like map of the space of what we explored.
And actually, this kind of compression is consistent with a theory called compression progress theory,
which aimed, which states that, you know, we seek information that can help us better compress the
world into a more compact representation that will later help us seek new novelties.
And in some other work we did, we actually found some evidence for this in the Wikipedia data set,
where as people were browsing pages, the compressibility of the networks they construct
increase over time. So yeah, in this next part of the talk, I'm going to try to argue that compression
can help us detect novelty in the first place. And try to address this question of how can we
efficiently process information? And how does that give rise to just this kind of novelty detection?
Just a quick question on the previous part one? Yeah.
So this is similar to research on, you know, exploration versus expectation,
and there's a whole bunch of studies in a sort of a bandit, sort of a bandit literature of optimal
strategies. And is this, are you finding something similar to that literature or human video here?
So yeah, so that's a great question. I am studying bandits in my postdoc now. There's a big difference
though, in that the bandit, you're very goal directed, you're trying to maximize reward.
And so there's different strategies that are optimal according to the structure of the bandit,
given that objective. And so given that difference in that this is supposed to be somewhat more of an
open ended non objective search, and that's much more of an objective search, you might not expect
similarities. But there are some strategies that look similar, such as like, you know,
