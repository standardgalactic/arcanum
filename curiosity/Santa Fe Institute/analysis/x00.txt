Yeah. Thank you for the invitation for inviting me to give this talk. I'll just launch right
in for time, but this talk will be trying to model curiosity and compression as complex
systems. Before I started grad school in the summer, right before I read this book by Melanie
Mitchell, actually, and it really inspired the way I think about what is like a compelling
explanation for a cognitive or a behavioral function. And so I don't think I need to tell
you, this audience, what a complex systems approach like this is, but I'll be trying
to treat. I'll try to be explaining curiosity and compression as behaviors of a system that
emerges from interactions between kind of simple and local interactions that are motivated
by theory. And specifically, I'll be trying to apply this approach to answer how we seek,
detect, and process novelties. So this talk will be in three parts. The first part, I'll
talk about curiosity, and I'll try to address the question, how and when do we seek novelties
versus familiarity? Yeah, and then the third part of the talk will be about how maybe the
brain is efficiently processing novel and familiar information using a compression process.
So just let's start with the curiosity part of the talk. In curiosity, there is this kind
of limiting model of education that's been proposed where it treats us as kind of passive
containers to be filled with information. And what I really like about curiosity research
is it's about kind of this active seeking and a history of active information seeking
choices. So here I'm showing you kind of information seeking dynamics on underlying network. And we
call this animation sparking curiosity, because it looks like a spark. And each of the colors
is a different kind of community of information being sought. And so we think of curiosity as
