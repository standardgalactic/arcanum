In the mm hmm. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's a great question. These are separate models. But yeah, you're right that
depression anxiety are generally correlated.
There's a factor commonly called like anxious misery. Yeah, that's used in the psychiatric
literature sometimes. And so this is a laboratory sample and not a clinical sample. So I think the
correlations would be weaker. And I would have to check again. It's been a while since I checked. But
yeah, you're totally right. But yeah, we did these in separate models. So they shouldn't be like
collinear in the same model or anything. Yeah.
You said more about the individual kind of grabbing pattern versus collective.
Oh, yeah. From this previous slide. Yeah. So what was nice is we get these individual differences of
how much people prefer to browse more similarly or dissimilarly to like their previous history of pages.
As an individual, that means that certain individuals on these extremes are not browsing
according to what the leaf light foraging theory would predict. And I think this has also been found
in some of the there's there's a little bit of controversy around these animal papers about how
much you have to look at average collective behavior versus like how much each individual is following
these efficiency constraints. So yeah, I think you're tapping on kind of a point of contention in these
models.
Is that through the slide after the depression and anxiety? Is that like across individual participants?
Yeah.
Or is it actually one perfect fit? You can have one session where they're more agents and they'll
