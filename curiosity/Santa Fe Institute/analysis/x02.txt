underlying network. And this temporal thread is what we're going to, which is the browsing sequence,
is what we're going to be using to construct each person's individual network. And so what this ends
up doing here, I'm showing you a random 10 sample of people where each color is a different person's
browsing. Each person ends up creating a distinct network. And you can kind of see, like, for instance,
the purple person explores all of one cluster before leaving to another one. The red one tends to
explore some of a cluster before jumping to a different one. And so you can already get a sense,
kind of the space traversed by different people and the different topics and where they kind of
coalesce or diverge and where they're exploring. Also importantly, these gray nodes are pages that are
accessible by just one more step. And that this kind of frontier of exploration has sometimes been
called the adjacent possible. And it's really kind of this idea that as people are browsing,
their actions allow them to seek future kind of new novelties and new pages to explore.
So this was a stochastic block model doing community detection.
Oh, so this is each dot is a Wikipedia page?
Yes, each dot is a Wikipedia page.
So we're not seeing the links here. Are we between the pages?
The pages will be... So if the pages are in a cluster, they tend to share links.
Yeah. And so we use that as an assumption that they're about similar topics. Yeah.
So is clustering based just on the topology of Wikipedia, not on the content of the pages?
We've tried both approaches here because we wanted to generalize this. I'll show you to around 500,000
readers. We wanted to use really simple networks. So this was just hyperlink networks. But we have
