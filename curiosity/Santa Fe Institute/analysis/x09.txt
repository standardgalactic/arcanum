intuitive that the laboratory data would be most similar to the mobile app data in network structures
generated. We kind of made that happen because we chose the same session length to do a fair comparison.
The next most similar model in terms of network topologies generated by different models was the
forging model. And then we also compare this to several alternative models, such as just a random
walk, if you just shuffled empirical networks, if you have a kind of a rich get richer, or like you
always go to things that are more popular kind of mechanism. We also compared it to really targeted
navigation where there's this game where you're set on a source node and you're asked to get to a
target node and as few jumps as possible, as few hyperlinks as possible. And that was also very
dissimilar. And so what this allows us to do is kind of visualize and quantify a space of canonical
networks in network science and compare it to the empirical browsing networks. And what we yeah,
so the takeaway is this that the search model is most similar to the mobile app data compared to
these alternatives that we tested. Okay, so the last part of this first part is when do we express
certain styles of curiosity? In the laboratory data, more constrained and more kind of seeking similar
pages correlated with periods of higher depressed mood and periods of anxiety. And so what this suggested
to us was that when you have this more constrained hunter-like browsing, it might help you regulate
uncertainty by not seeking out totally novel information that might be disconnected from
your current experience. And it might be more regulatory for this person to seek familiar
information that has that kind of familiarity to it. But due to our foraging model, it suggests that
this is a less efficient foraging pattern in the long run if they wanted to seek out things that
they might find valuable or pleasurable.
