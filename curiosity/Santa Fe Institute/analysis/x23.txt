And the trade-off, though, is that if you discard more information, you're at a greater risk of
making false alarms. So you're at a greater risk of seeing a new image and saying that you've seen
it before, even when you haven't. And this is because when you have this really aggressive
compression, it's really hard to distinguish what this is. Like it could be a croissant or a slug or
something, but it's actually a seashell. And so everything kind of gets blurred together a little
bit. Okay, so we found some evidence that lossiness can support this form of novelty detection by
pattern separation, but that the trade-off is that by really aggressively compressing, we increase the
rate of false alarms. And we perform this lossy compression on sensory and semantic features of
the information. So in the final part of the talk, I'm just going to go through how we think we can
measure compression in brain networks specifically, and how the brain processes information. So in case
the audience isn't familiar with neuroimaging methods, we can get a measure of the structural
connectivity strength across regions of the brain, basically by tracking water flow along tracts.
So this is kind of like when it rains and you see water dripping on like tree limbs, you can get a
sense of if you track the trajectory of the water, the structure of a tract in the brain. So this is
called like diffusion tensor imaging, it gets us a measure of the strength of white matter
connectivity. We can also segment the brain into regions by either its function or its cellular
makeup. And we apply these atlases to segment each region. Then when we have this, we can use the
regions as nodes of a network and the white matter connectivity strength, that's the edges of a
network to create a structural connectivity matrix. And we can get dynamics per node using something like
fMRI. So decades of research in neuroscience has suggested that we can kind of like locate a
