(immune networks), sensorimotor and neurocognitive (the nervous
system), or social (animal societies).
Dynamic co-emergence best describes the sort of emergence we see
in autonomy. In an autonomous system, the whole not only arises
from the (organizational closure of) the parts, but the parts also arise
from the whole.12 The whole is constituted by the relations of the
parts, and the parts are constituted by the relations they bear to one
another in the whole. Hence, the parts do not exist in advance, prior
to the whole, as independent entities that retain their identity in the
whole. Rather, part and whole co-emerge and mutually specify each
other.
Biological life, seen from the perspective of autopoiesis, provides a
paradigm case of dynamic co-emergence. A minimal autopoietic whole
emerges from the dynamic interdependence of a membrane boundary
and an internal chemical reaction network. The membrane and reaction network (as well as the molecules that compose them) do not preexist as independent entities. Rather, they co-emerge through their integrative, metabolic relation to each other. They produce and constitute
the whole, while the whole produces them and subordinates them to it.
We will come back to this paradigm case of dynamic co-emergence in
Part II.
