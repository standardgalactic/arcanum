The rule is very simple:
To multiply a two-digit number by 11, just add the two digits and place
this sum between the two digits.
Let's try using this technique. Suppose you need to multiply 45 by 11.
According to the rule, add 4 and 5 and place this sum between the 4 and 5 to get
495.
This can become a bit more difficult when the sum of the two digits you are
adding results in a two-digit number. We no longer have a single digit to place
between the two original digits. So, if the sum of the two digits is greater than 9,
then we place the units digit between the two digits of the number being
multiplied by 11 and “carry” the tens digit to be added to the hundreds digit of
the multiplicand. (Recall: The multiplicand is the number that is multiplied by
another number, the multiplier—in this case, 11.) Let's try this procedure by
finding the product of 78 · 11. We first get the sum of the digits: 7 + 8 = 15. We
place the 5 between the 7 and 8, and then we add the 1 to the 7, to get [7 + 1][5]
[8], or 858.
It is fair to ask whether this technique also holds true when a number

consisting of more than two digits is multiplied by 11. Let's go straight for a
larger number such as 12,345 and multiply it by 11. Here we retain the first and
last digit, then we begin at the right-side digit and add every pair of digits, going
to the left: 1[1 + 2][2 + 3][3 + 4][4 + 5]5 = 135,795.
As was the case earlier, if the sum of two digits is greater than 9, then we
place the units digit appropriately and carry the tens digit. To better understand
how this is done, consider the following multiplication, 456,789 · 11:
Follow along as we carry the process step-by-step:
4[4 + 5][5 + 6][6 + 7][7 + 8][8 + 9]9
4[4 + 5][5 + 6][6 + 7][7 + 8][17]9
4[4 + 5][5 + 6][6 + 7][7 + 8 + 1][7]9
4[4 + 5][5 + 6][6 + 7][16][7]9
4[4 + 5][5 + 6][6 + 7 + 1][6][7]9
4[4 + 5][5 + 6][14][6][7]9
4[4 + 5][5 + 6 + 1][4][6][7]9
4[4 + 5][12][4][6][7]9
4[4 + 5 + 1][2][4][6][7]9
4[10][2][4][6][7]9
[4 + 1][0][2][4][6][7]9
[5][0][2][4][6][7]9

This technique for multiplying by 11 might well be shared with your friends.
Not only will they be impressed with your cleverness, they may also appreciate
knowing this shortcut.
We now revert back to the number 9, as we search for a technique for
multiplying any number by 9. Although this technique may be a bit
cumbersome, especially when compared to using a calculator, this algorithm
provides some insights into number theory, which is the basis for our
understanding arithmetic processes. The number 9 has another unusual feature
that enables us to use a surprising multiplication algorithm. Don't be distracted
by the rather-complicated appearance. Just know that we present it here to
indicate a multiplication property provided by the number 9. This procedure is
intended for multiplying numbers of two digits or more by 9. It is best to discuss
the procedure as we apply it to the multiplication 76,354 · 9.
Step 1
Subtract the units digit of the
multiplicand from 10.
10 – 4 = 6

Step 2
Subtract each of the remaining
digits (beginning with the tens
digit) from 9, and then add this
result to the previous digit in the
multiplicand, read it from right to
left. (For any two-digit sums, carry
the tens digit to the next sum.)
9 – 5 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8
9 – 3 = 6, 6 + 5 = 11, 1
9 – 6 = 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 1 = 7
9 – 7 = 2, 2 + 6 = 8
Step 3
Subtract 1 from the left-most digit
of the multiplicand.
7 – 1 = 6
Step 4
List the results in reverse order to
get the desired product.

Although the technique here is not one that would be used to do the
multiplication, we merely offer it for your amusement and so that the number 9
does not feel neglected in the multiplication process as compared to the number
11.
To compensate for the inability of the 9 to compete with the 11 in the process
of multiplication, we shall present a procedure that the 9 provides beyond that of
the 11.
HOW 9s CAN CHECK YOUR ARITHMETIC
As we mentioned earlier, the first occurrence in Western Europe of the Hindu-
Arabic numerals we use today was in the book Liber Abaci, which was written
in 1202 by Leonardo of Pisa (otherwise known as Fibonacci). As a young boy,
Fibonacci traveled with his father, who directed a trading post in Bugia (in
modern-day Algeria). Fibonacci traveled extensively along the Mediterranean
coast, where he met merchants and became fascinated with the number system
they used to do arithmetic. Recall that the publication of Liber Abaci provided
the first use of these numerals in Europe. Before that, roman numerals were used
extensively. They were, clearly, much more cumbersome to use for calculation
than these ten numerals he had experienced in the Arabic world and which had
originated in India.
Fascinated as Fibonacci was by the arithmetic calculations used in the Islamic
world, in his book he introduced the system of “casting out nines”—which refers
to a calculation check to determine if your result is possibly correct. The process
