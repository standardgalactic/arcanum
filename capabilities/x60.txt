Figure 7.1.
To determine the numerical value of the golden ratio,  we will change this
equation2 
 or 
 to its equivalent, when 
 to get the following:3 
We can now solve this equation for x using the quadratic formula,4 which you
may recall from high school. We then obtain the numerical value of the golden
ratio: 
 which is commonly denoted by the Greek letter, phi: ϕ.5
≈ 1.618033988749894848204586834365638117720
Notice what happens when we take the reciprocal of  namely, 
 which, when we multiply by 1 in the form of 
 we find that:
0.618033988749894848204586834365638117720.
From the equation we got above, we can simplify it to obtain the quadratic
equation as follows:
x = 1 +  is equivalent to x2 – x – 1 = 0.
(This equation also leads to the golden ratio: x2 + x – 1 = 0.) To come full circle
on this, we can see that the value ϕ satisfies the equation x2 – x – 1 = 0, as shown
here:

The other solution of this equation is 
 while – ϕ satisfies the
equation x2 + x – 1 = 0, as you can see here: (–ϕ)2 + (–ϕ) – 1 = ϕ2 – ϕ – 1 = 
 The other solution to this equation is 
At this point, you should notice a very unusual relationship. The values of ϕ
and  differ by 1. That is, ϕ –  = 1. From the normal relationship of reciprocals,
the product of ϕ and  is also equal to 1, that is, ϕ ∙  = 1. Therefore, we have two
numbers, ϕ and  whose difference and product is 1—these are the only two
numbers for which this is true! By the way, you might have noticed that 
 since 
Now that we have established the golden ratio, we can take it one step further
to create a rectangle whose sides are in this golden ratio. To do that, we will
begin with a unit square,6 ABCD, with midpoint M of side AB, and then draw a
circular arc MC, cutting the extension of side AB at point E. We now can claim
that the line segment AE is partitioned into the golden ratio at point B. This, of
course, has to be substantiated.
Figure 7.2.
To verify this claim, we would have to apply the definition of the golden ratio,
 and see if it, in fact, holds true. Substituting the values obtained by
applying the Pythagorean theorem to ΔMBC as shown in figure 7.2, we get the
following:
It follows that

We then can find the value of 
 that is, 
 which turns out to be a true
proportion, since the cross products are equal. That is, 
We can also see in figure 7.2 that point B can be said to divide the line
segment AE into an inner golden ratio, since 
Meanwhile, point E can be said to divide the line segment AB into an outer
golden ratio, since 
You ought to take notice of the shape of the rectangle AEFD in figure 7.2. The
ratio of the length to the width is the golden ratio: 
 This appealing
shape is called the golden rectangle.
For centuries, artists and architects have identified what they believed to be
the most perfectly shaped rectangle. This ideal, golden rectangle has also proved
to be the most pleasing to the eye. The desirability of this rectangle has been
borne out by numerous psychological experiments. For example, Gustav
Fechner (1801–1887), a German experimental psychologist, inspired by Adolf
Zeising's book, Der Goldene Schnitt,7 began a serious inquiry to see if the
golden rectangle had a special psychological aesthetic appeal. His findings were
published in 1876.8 Fechner made thousands of measurements of commonly
seen rectangles, such as playing cards, writing pads, books, windows, and so on.
He found that most had a ratio of length to width that was close to ϕ. He also
tested people's preferences and found most people preferred the shape of the
golden rectangle.

Figure 7.3.
What Gustav Fechner actually did was to ask 228 men and 119 women which
of the following rectangles is aesthetically the most pleasing. Take a look at the
rectangles in figure 7.3. Which rectangle would you choose as the most pleasing
to look at? Rectangle 1:1 is too much like a square—considered by the general
public as not representative of a “rectangle.” It is, after all, a square! On the
other hand, rectangle 2:5 (the other extreme) is uncomfortable to look at, since it
requires the eye to scan it horizontally. The rectangle 21:34 can be appreciated at
a single glance. Fechner's findings seem to bear this out. The results that Fechner
reported are shown in table 7.1.
