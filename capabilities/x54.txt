contrast to the male bee, the egg-producing female that was its mother must have
had a mother and father, so the third line has both a male and a female. It then
continues with this pattern: the immediate ancestor of every male is a single
female, and the immediate ancestors of a female are a male and a female. At the
right of the figure is a summary of the number of bees in each row. As you look
down in each column at the right, you will recognize the familiar Fibonacci
numbers.
Figure 6.14.
FIBONACCI NUMBERS IN THE PLANT WORLD
Perhaps you would be most surprised to discover that these ubiquitous numbers
also appear in the plant world. Take for example the pineapple. It might even be
worth your while to get a pineapple and see for yourself that the Fibonacci
numbers are represented on it. The hexagonal bracts on a pineapple can be seen

to form three different-direction spirals. In figures 6.15, 6.16, 6.17, and 6.18 you
will notice that in the three directions there are 5, 8, and 13 spirals. These are
three consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

THE PINE CONE AND OTHERS
There are various species of pine cones (e.g., Norway spruce; Douglas fir or
spruce; and Larch). Most pine cones will have two distinct-direction spirals.
Spiral arrangements are classified by the number of visible spirals (parastichies)
that they exhibit. The number of spirals in each direction will be most often two
successive Fibonacci numbers. The two pictures of figure 6.19 bear this out, but
you may want to convince yourself by finding some actual pine cones and
counting the spirals yourself.
Figure 6.19.
These pine cones have 8 spirals in one direction and 13 in the other direction.
Again, you will notice that these are Fibonacci numbers. Table 6.1 shows how
the Fibonacci numbers can be found on pine cones of other species of pine trees.

Table 6.1.
The following designations of spiral patterns do not make any pretense of
completeness. Actually, bracts can be lined up into sequences in many ways. The
following are simply some of the more-obvious patterns that have been
observed. (Regarding the notation, 8-5, for example, means that starting from a

given bract and proceeding along two different-direction spirals, 8 bracts will be
found for one spiral and 5 for the other.)
