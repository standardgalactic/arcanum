Table 3.2.
If we take the arithmetic mean (the usual average) of the nr values, we get
72.04092314, which is quite close to 72, and so our “Rule of 72” seems to be a
very close estimate for doubling money at an annual interest rate of r percent for
n interest periods.
An ambitious reader or one with a very strong mathematics background might
try to determine a “rule” for tripling and quadrupling money, similar to the way
we dealt with the doubling of money. The above equation (2) for k-tupling would
be
which for r = 8, gives the value for n = 29.91884022 (log k). Thus nr =
239.3507218 log k, which for k = 3 (the tripling effect) gives us nr =

114.1993167. We could then say that for tripling money we would have a “Rule
of 114.”
Although we use computer calculation, for the most part, to determine
compound interest, here we see a simple trick that allows us to skip a sizable
portion of calculation and still come up with a useful answer. Once again, we see
how mathematics helps us financially.
PAPER SIZES AND THE ROOT OF ALL ISO
Hardly a day goes by when we don't come into contact with the typical sheet of
paper. Although this paper seems common, there are some fascinating
mathematical relationships that can be noticed in the dimensions of the paper
itself. Let's consider some of those now. The most common paper sizes in the
United States are the “letter,” the “legal,” and the “ledger,” also known as
“tabloid.” Their exact dimensions, as shown in table 3.3, were defined by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
Table 3.3.
The size of a “ledger”/“tabloid” is exactly twice the size of a “letter,” but their
aspect ratios (i.e., the ratio of the width to the length) are different. While the
ANSI paper sizes are also standard in Canada, all other countries in the world
have adopted a different system of standard sizes defined by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO). In the ISO system, there are three series
of paper sizes, named “A,” “B,” and “C.” The sizes specified in each series have
a very convenient property that the ANSI paper sizes do not have. First, by
dividing an ISO sheet into two equal halves parallel to its shorter edges, we will
obtain a sheet whose dimensions are exactly those of the next smaller size in this
series, just as half a “ledger/tabloid” is the size of a “letter.” But, unlike the
ANSI paper sizes, the aspect ratio is the same for all formats in the ISO system.
This is a particularly useful characteristic, since it means that sheets can be
scaled up or down to other sizes without any margins or cutoffs. However, the
scaling property of the ISO paper sizes requires a very special aspect ratio, and
with just a little bit of mathematics we can easily find out what this special ratio

must be.
Consider a rectangular sheet of paper with longer side a and shorter side b, as
shown in figure 3.1. Thus, the aspect ratio is  Now fold the sheet in half,
parallel to its shorter edges. Clearly, the longer edge of the halves will be b and
the shorter edge will be 
Figure 3.1.
Hence, the aspect ratio of the folded sheet is
If we want this to be equal to the aspect ratio of the original sheet, we must
have 
 Multiplying this equation by 
 we get 
 This implies that 
(where both a and b are positive). Therefore, only a sheet whose length-to-width
ratio is exactly √2 can be folded or cut in halves (parallel to its shorter edge)
without compromising this ratio.
The useful scaling property of paper sizes that are based on √2 was first
recognized and advocated by the German physicist and philosopher Georg
Christoph Lichtenberg (1742–1799). His idea was soon adopted in France,
during the French Revolution. In the early twentieth century, a complete system
of paper sizes was introduced in Germany that later turned into the ISO standard
sizes. The dimensions of the five largest formats in the “A” series of the ISO
paper sizes are shown in table 3.4. Theoretically, an A0 sheet is defined as a
sheet with aspect ratio √2 and an area of 1 square meter. However, for practical
reasons, the dimensions in the ISO norm are rounded to whole millimeters.
Therefore, the aspect ratios are not all equal, and of course, they are also not
exactly equal to √2 = 1.414213562…, but the difference is insignificant.

Table 3.4.
To illustrate an advantage of the scaling property of ISO paper sizes, let us
consider a document printed on A4 sheets. Using a photocopier, we can reduce it
to A5 so that two pages will fit on one A4 sheet. Since the aspect ratio stays the
same, there will be no excess empty space. Analogously, we may magnify it to
A3 without any waste of paper.
Table 3.5.
In 1995, the American National Standards Institute adopted a system of paper
sizes based upon the “letter” size and similar to the ISO system. Here, the
“letter” size is represented by “ANSI A” and the “ledger”/“tabloid” by “ANSI
B.” Cutting a sheet in half produces two sheets of the next smaller size, but the
aspect ratio is not preserved, since it was not equal to √2 in the first place.
However, folding a sheet with sides a and b twice, we obtain a sheet with sides 
and  (refer back to figure 3.1), whose aspect ratio is again  So at least the
aspect ratio is the same for every second paper size in this series.

The ISO paper sizes are a nice example of how elementary mathematical
relationships can be used to produce an everyday item with a very convenient
