required is that all the rows, columns, and diagonals have the same sum. This

VIEWING A STATUE OPTIMALLY
Most cities in the world exhibit some magnificent statues. The statues are often
on very high pedestals, which forces us to look up at them, especially when we
are very close to the statue. Of course, as we move away from the statue, we get
a better picture of the person depicted therein. However, there must be an
optimal position at which we can stand to view the full statue in the best way

possible.
To analyze this situation, let us begin with a simple geometric rendition of
how this would play out. In figure 7.35, we will place our eye level at point A,
and the actual statue will be depicted by the segment BD (s). The segment DC
(p) will represent the height of the pedestal above our eye level.
Figure 7.35.
To begin our quest for the best place to stand, we will first need to find the
tangent functions as follows:
tan ∠BAC = tan (x + y) = 
tan ∠DAC = tan y = 
We then use a formula from high-school trigonometry for the tangent function
of an angle sum:
tan ∠BAC = tan (x + y) = 
 which yields upon solving for tan x:
tan x = 
Applying this formula to figure 7.35, we substitute tan(x + y) = 
 and tan y =
 to find the value tan x:

We want to find the value for d, the distance from the base of the pedestal to
the eye of the observer, which will give us the largest angle BAD for given p and
s. This will optimize our view of the statue. Of course, the largest angle occurs
when its tangent function, tan x, is largest. Thus, we have to maximize 
 for
fixed p and s. This is equivalent to minimizing the reciprocal 
which is equivalent to finding the value for d, which will give the smallest value
for 
 + d. Now we use a little trick and write this as
a technique known as “completing the square.” Obviously, this sum attains its
smallest possible value when the value of 
 is equal to 0, which is the
case if 
 which simplifies to p(s + p) = d2. Or, to put it another way, the
largest angle BAD occurs when 
 which represents the geometric
mean between the height of the pedestal (p) and the top height of the statue and
the pedestal (s + p).
Suppose we try this with perhaps one of the most famous statues in Western
culture, the statue of David, by Michelangelo. The statue is 5.17 meters high,
and we will assume that the pedestal above eye level is 1 meter high. Therefore,
using our formula, 
 which determines the distance
we need to stand back from the statue to see it optimally (2.48 meters).
Another example of this technique for finding the best place to view
something is when a museum puts up an exhibit and hangs big pictures on the
wall; the question often arises, How high should the picture be hung so that a
person sitting on a bench at a specific distance from the wall would be able to
have the largest viewing angle of this picture? This calculation is done exactly as
we have done with the statue above. Simple geometry can be very useful for
practical issues.
