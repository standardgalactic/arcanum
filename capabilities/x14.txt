requires subtracting a specific number of groups of 9 from the sum of the digits
of the result (or, in other words, taking bundles of 9 away from the sum).
Although this technique might come in handy, the nice thing about it is that it

again demonstrates a hidden magic in ordinary arithmetic.
Before we discuss this arithmetic-checking procedure, we will consider how
the remainder of a division by 9 compares to removing groups of 9 from the
digit sum of the number. Let us find the remainder, when, say, 8,768 is divided
by 9. Using a calculator, we find that the quotient is 974 with a remainder of 2.
This remainder can also be obtained by “casting out nines” from the digit sum
of the number 8,768: This means that we will find the sum of the digits; and if
the sum is more than a single digit, we shall repeat the procedure with the
obtained sum. In the case of our given number, 8,768, the digit sum is 29 (8 + 7
+ 6 + 8 = 29). Since this result is not a single-digit number, we will repeat the
process with the number 29. Again, the casting-out-nines procedure is used to
obtain 2 + 9 = 11; and, again, repeating this procedure for 11, we get 1 + 1 = 2,
which is the same remainder as when we earlier divided 8,768 by 9.
We can now take this process of casting out nines to another application, that
of checking multiplication. Perhaps it is best to see it applied. We would like to
see if the following multiplication is correct: 734 · 879 = 645,186. We can check
this by division, but that would be somewhat lengthy. We can also see if this
product could be correct by casting out nines. To do that, we will take each of
the factors and the product and then add the digits of each number—continuing
this process as before until a single digit results:
For 734:          7 + 3 + 4 = 14; then 1 + 4 = 5.
For 879:          8 + 7 + 9 = 24; then 2 + 4 = 6.
For 645,186:   6 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 8 + 6 = 30; then 3 + 0 = 3.
The product of the first two factors is 5 · 6 = 30, which yields 3 by casting out
nines (3 + 0 = 3); because this is the same as what we obtained when we added
the digits of the product 645,186 (30), the answer could be correct.
For practice, we will do another casting-out-nines “check” for the following
multiplication:
56,589 · 983,678 = 55,665,354,342
For 56,589:
5 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 33;
3 + 3 = 6
For 983,678:
9 + 8 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 41;
4 + 1 = 5
For 55,665,354,342:
5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 48;
 
4 + 8 = 12;
1 + 2 = 3
To check for possibly having the correct product, we multiply the results from
our first two factors: 6 · 5 = 30, or 3 + 0 = 3, which matches the 3 resulting from

the product digit.
A similar procedure can be used to check for the likelihood of a correct sum or
quotient, simply by taking the sum (or quotient) and casting out nines, then
taking the sum (or quotient) of these “remainders” and comparing it with the
remainder of the sum (or quotient). They should be equal if the answer is correct.
As we deal with the base-10 throughout our lives, it is good to see how the
numbers on either side of the 10 have special properties because of their position
relative to 10. Once again, because our culture has selected 10 as the base for our
number system, we have had an opportunity to explore the peculiarities that
evolve from this arrangement.
RULES FOR DIVISIBILITY
Having discussed some of the peculiarities of the numbers 9 and 11 (which
included rules for divisibility), it is appropriate for us now to consider rules for
divisibility by other numbers. We can easily determine when a number is
divisible by 2 or by 5, simply by looking at the last digit (i.e., the units digit) of
the number. That is, if the last digit is an even number (such as 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, and
so on), then the number will be divisible by 2. A fun fact that is not as well
known is that if the number formed by the last two digits of a given number is
divisible by 4, then the number itself is divisible by 4. Also, if the number
formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8, then the number itself is divisible
by 8. You ought to be able to extend this rule to divisibility by higher powers of
2 as well.
Similarly, for 5, if the last digit of the number being inspected for divisibility
is either a 0 or 5, then the number itself will be divisible by 5. If the number
formed by the last two digits is divisible by 25, then the number itself is divisible
by 25. The similarity of this rule to the previous one results from the fact that 2
and 5 are the prime factors of 10, which is the base of our decimal number
system.
With the proliferation of the calculator, there is no longer a crying need to be
able to detect by which numbers a given number is divisible. You can simply do
the division on a calculator. Yet, for a better appreciation of mathematics,
divisibility rules provide an interesting window into the nature of numbers and
their properties. For this reason (among others), the topic of divisibility still finds
a place on the mathematics-learning spectrum.
Most perplexing has always been to establish rules for divisibility by prime
numbers (which are numbers whose only factors are 1 and the number itself).

This is especially true of the rule for divisibility by 7, which follows a series of
very nifty divisibility rules for the numbers 2 through 6. As you will soon see,
the techniques for some of the divisibility rules for prime numbers are almost as
cumbersome as an actual division algorithm, yet they are fun, and, believe it or
not, they can come in handy. Let us consider the rule for divisibility by 7 and
then, as we inspect it, let's see how this can be generalized for other prime
numbers.
The rule for divisibility by 7: Delete the last digit from the given number,
and then subtract twice this deleted digit from the remaining number.
If the result is divisible by 7, the original number is divisible by 7. This
process may be repeated if the result is too large for simple inspection
of divisibility of 7.
Let's try an example to see how this rule works. Suppose we want to test the
number 876,547 for divisibility by 7. Begin with 876,547 and delete its units
digit, 7, and subtract its double, 14, from the remaining number: 87,654 – 14 =
87,640. Since we cannot yet visually inspect the resulting number for divisibility
