Another shopping situation in which mathematics can be helpful is when there
are discounts of different types. Suppose you have two sales-promotion coupons
for the same store, one that says “20 percent off” (independent of the purchase)
and one that applies only if a certain minimal amount of money is spent, for

example, “$15 off for purchases exceeding $49.99.” Assuming that the two
coupons cannot be combined, then which one would be more advantageous to
use, if the item we want to buy costs, say, $80? The 20 percent off coupon would
yield a price of $64, while the $15 reduction would yield a price of $65. It might
be nice to know at which price the coupon for 20 percent off will become the
more advantageous option.
To approach this problem, we may consider two extreme cases. Let's consider
an item costing $50, since the minimal purchase that qualifies for the second
coupon is $50, which when reduced by $15 would be $35. On the other hand, the
fixed-percentage coupon would yield a reduction of 20 percent, or one fifth, of
$50, which is $10. That means we would have to pay $40, if we used the fixed-
percentage coupon. Thus, the $15-off coupon would be the better choice for a
$50 purchase.
The other extreme case would be infinity, but since we can spend only a finite
amount of money, let's assume our budget is very high, say it is $150. One fifth
of $150 is $30. Therefore, the 20 percent coupon yields a reduced price of $120,
while the other coupon (a reduction of $15) would result in a price of $135.
Obviously, the better choice of coupon depends on the total sum of the purchase.
For the fixed-percentage coupon, the amount of money saved increases with the
price, whereas we cannot save more than $15 with the other coupon. The
extreme cases we have considered show that there must be some break-even
point X between $50 and $150 at which price both coupons yield the same
discount. For purchases at $50, the 20 percent reduction will be $10 and the $15-
off coupon is therefore preferred; but, for purchases at or above $50 and below
X, the $15-off coupon is still the better choice. To find the break-even price X for
a 20 percent coupon and a $15-off coupon, we just have to compute: X – 0.20X =
X – $15, and then X = $75. Therefore, if we want to buy an item for more than
$75, we should use the 20 percent coupon.
Occasionally you may also encounter different types of coupons that are
combinable, although this is a rare phenomenon, since most stores are usually
not that generous to their customers. Let's take a look at such a situation, since it
provides an example for the mathematical notion of noncommutativity. Suppose
we were allowed to use both coupons for the same purchase, that is, coupon A
with a 20 percent discount as well as coupon B with a $15 reduction. Now the
question arises whether or not the order of the discounts matters. If it were to
matter, which of the two coupons should be used first? Denoting the price
without any discount by P (which we assume to be at least $50 for the sake of
simplicity), we obtain the following:

a reduced price by using coupon A first is pA,B = P · 0.8 – $15, and
a reduced price by using coupon B first is pB,A = (P – $15) · 0.8
To summarize, applying coupon B first gives us pB,A = (P – $15) · 0.8 = P ·
0.8 – $12; because that is more than pA,B, which is P · 0.8 – $15, we should
apply coupon A first, unless P · 0.8 is less than $50. In this case, the $15-off
coupon (B) would not be applicable anymore and we would have to use coupon
B first to get the more favorable price.
Two operations that will in general lead to different results if their order is
reversed are called “noncommutative” in mathematics. As our analysis showed,
these different types of discounts are an example of noncommutative operations,
meaning that the order does matter! You should think about that if you are
offered combinable discounts of different types. However, requesting your
preferred order might be a bit of a challenge.
RAISING INTEREST!
We are often confronted with advertisements by savings institutions offering
attractive interest rates and frequent compounding of interest on deposits. Since
most banks have a variety of programs, it's valuable for potential depositors to
understand how interest is calculated under each of the available options. In our
discussion of interest rates and practices we will use the formula for compound
interest to calculate the return on investments at any rate of interest, for any
period of time, and for any commonly used frequency of compounding,
including instantaneous (continuous) compounding. These aspects will also
determine which of two or more alternatives gives the best return over the same
time period.
Let's consider the following interesting problem:
The problem: In the year 1626, Peter Minuit bought Manhattan Island
for the Dutch West India Company from the Native Americans called
the Lenape (Indians) for trinkets costing 60 Dutch guilders, or about
$24. Suppose the Lenape had been able to invest this $24 at that time at
an annual interest rate of 6 percent, and suppose further that this same
interest rate had continued in effect all these years. How much money
could the present-day descendants of these the Lenape collect if (1) only
simple interest were calculated, and (2) interest were compounded (a)
annually, (b) quarterly, and (c) continuously?

The answers to these questions should surprise everyone!
Perhaps you will recall that simple interest is calculated by taking the product
of the principal, P; the annual interest rate, r; and the time in years, t.
Accordingly, you have the formula I = Prt, and in the above problem I = (24)
(0.06)(392) = $564.48 as simple interest. Add this to the principal of $24.00 to
obtain the amount A of $588.48 available in 2018. You have just used the
formula for “amount,” A = P + Prt.
With this relatively small sum in mind (for a return after 392 years!), let's
investigate the extent to which this return would have been improved if interest
had been compounded annually instead of being calculated on only a simple
basis. With a principal P, an annual rate of interest r, and a time t = 1, the
amount A at the end of the first year is given by the formula A1 = P + Pr = P(1 +
r). (The subscript indicates the year at the end of which interest is calculated.)
Now A1 = P(1 + r) becomes the principal at the beginning of the second year,
upon which interest will be credited during the second year.
Therefore, A2 = P(1 + r) + P(1 + r)r = P(1 + r)(1 + r) = P(1 + r)2. Since the
last expression represents the principal at the beginning of the third year, you
have A3 = P(1 + r)2 + P(1 + r)2r = P(1 + r)2(1 + r) = P(1 + r)3. By now, you will
see the emerging pattern and should be able to suggest the generalization for the
amount after t years,
At = P(1 + r)t.
