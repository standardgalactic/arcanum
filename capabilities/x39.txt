(table 4.5). To construct this table, a sample of 10 million people was used. Their
life span was recorded from birth until age ninety-nine. At each age level, the
table records the number of people alive at the start of the year and the number
of deaths that occurred during the year. Then the following ratio is computed:
This ratio is then converted to deaths per 1,000, which is called the death rate.
This death rate, as you will see, is crucial in computing the premium that
policyholders will pay.

Table 4.5.
We are now ready to address the following problem.
The problem: What is the probability that an eighteen-year-old will die,
if, out of 6,509 eighteen-year-olds alive at the beginning of the year, 11
died?
The probability is 
However, life insurance companies prefer to transform
this ratio into death rate per 1,000. For general purposes, we will change the
fraction 
 
into 
 
to 
set 
up 
the 
following 
proportion: 
 where x = death rate per 1,000. This gives us 
 or x = 1.69. This means that 1.69 people out of the original 1,000 will
have died by the end of the eighteenth year. The insurance companies use this
information to calculate the premium they will charge a group of eighteen-year-
olds. Suppose there were 1,000 eighteen-year-olds who insured themselves for
$1,000 each for one year. How much would the company have to pay out at the
end of the year? If 1.69 people die, the company will pay out $1,690 (1.69 ·
1,000 = 1,690). Thus, how much must the company charge each of the 1,000
policyholders? (This does not take into account profit or operating expenses.)
The $1,690 divided evenly among 1,000 people equals $1.69 per person.
In the previous discussion, we did not take into consideration the fact that
money paid to the company earns interest during the year. So, besides
considering the death rate, the interest rate must also be taken into account when
calculating the premium. We now need to recall from the previous chapter the

concept of compound interest. Let's consider how much money will be on
deposit in a bank at the end of the year if you deposit $100 at 5 percent interest.
The answer is $100 plus 0.05 (100), or 100 · 1.05, which is $105. If the $105 is
kept in the bank another year, what will it amount to? Let's look at the math:
$105 + 0.05(105), or $100 · 1.05 · 1.05 or $100 · (1.05)2, which amounts to
$110.25. We will then write the general formula using P = original principal, i =
rate of interest per period, A = the amount of money at the end of the specified
time, and n = the number of years the principal is on deposit. The formula is A =
P(1 + i)n.
Consider how much money you would have to deposit now in a bank whose
rate of interest is 5 percent, if you wanted $100 to accumulate by one year from
now. In the previous example, we saw that $100 grew to $105 in one year's time.
This information is used to set up a proportion:
How much would have to be deposited now to accumulate $100 at the end of
two years’ time?
It would be 
 and x = $90.70. We are now ready to derive a
formula for calculating the present value from the formula for compound
interest, which we derived above as
We can now return to the original problem of the life insurance company that
has to pay out $1,690 at the end of the year to the deceased eighteen-year-old's
beneficiaries. What is the present value of $1,690? In other words, how much
must the insurance company collect at the beginning of the year so that it can
pay out $1,690 at the end of the year? By using the present value formula, we
computed that for every $1 the company has to pay, it must collect $0.9524 at
the beginning of the year. If the company has to pay $1,690, then it has to collect
$1,609.56 in total from its 1,000 eighteen-year-olds (1,690 · 0.9524 =
$1,609.56). Thus, each policyholder must contribute a premium of 
You may now pose another problem. Suppose another group of 1,000 people
aged twenty-five bought policies for one year worth $1,000 apiece (the death
benefit is $1,000). According to the mortality table, their death rate is 1.93; this
means that 1.93 out of 1,000 twenty-five-year-olds die during their twenty-fifth
year. What will the net premium be if the interest rate is 5 percent? Again, the
death rate per 1,000 at age twenty-five = 1.93. The amount needed to pay claims

= (1.93 · 1,000) = $1,930. The interest factor = $0.9524. The present value of
claims due in one year ($1,930 · 0.9524) = $1,838.13, and the number of persons
paying premium = 1,000. Therefore, the net premium 
 This
process may be continued for additional years of insurance.
We have only taken a simple sample to provide some insight into the
calculation of life insurance premiums. It is clear that life insurance companies
need to earn money and at the same time provide a justifiable premium.
Obviously, mathematics plays a key role here. Enough about finance! Let's look
at some counterintuitive arithmetic in everyday life.
THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD AVERAGE
Most unsuspecting readers, when asked to calculate the average speed for a
round trip with a “going” average speed of 30 miles per hour and a “returning”
average speed of 60 miles per hour would think that their average speed for the
entire trip is 45 miles per hour (calculated as 
 The first task is to realize
that this is the wrong answer. Is it fair to consider the two speeds with equal
“weight”? After all, the two speeds were achieved for different lengths of time;
therefore, we know that they should not get the same weight. We realize that the
trip at the slower speed, 30 mph, took twice as long, and therefore ought to get
twice the weight in the calculation of the average round-trip speed. This would
then bring the calculation to the following: 
 which happens to be the
correct average speed.
