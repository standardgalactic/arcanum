decisions in our everyday lives. We shall begin with some arithmetic shortcuts
that can allow you to look at numbers and make some mental calculations—even
faster than the calculator can.
ARITHMETIC WITH THE NUMBERS 9 AND 11
You may have wondered why certain numbers carry some special properties that
allow a simplification of arithmetic processes, or, in other words, some
arithmetic tricks. Let's consider some of these here. Both the number 11 and the

number 9 are situated on either side of the number 10—which is the base of our
number system—and therefore have very interesting properties. These properties
give these numbers some unusual benefits in calculation. Let us begin by
examining how we can determine divisibility by the numbers 9 and 11.
There are times in everyday-life situations when it is useful to know if a given
number is divisible by 9 or by 3—especially if it can be done mentally! For
example, suppose a restaurant bill of $71.22 needs to be split into three equal
parts. Before actually doing the division, the thought about whether or not it is
possible to split the bill equally into three parts may come into question.
Wouldn't it be nice if there were some mental arithmetic shortcut for determining
this? Well, here comes mathematics to the rescue. We are going to provide you
with a rule to determine if a number is divisible by 3 or divisible by 9. The rule,
simply stated, is:
If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3 (or 9), then the
original number is divisible by 3 (or 9).
Perhaps an example would be best to introduce this technique. Consider the
number 276,357. Let's test it for divisibility by 3 (or 9). The sum of the digits is
2 + 7 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 30, which is divisible by 3, but not by 9. Therefore, the
original number (276,357) is divisible by 3, but not by 9. However, the number
14,688 is divisible by both 3 and 9, since the sum of its digits is 1 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 8
= 27, which is divisible by both 3 and 9.
Just to make sure you are comfortable with this procedure, we will consider
another example. Is the number 457,875 divisible by 3 or 9? The sum of the
digits is 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 36, which is divisible by 9 (and then, of course,
by 3 as well), so the number 457,875 is divisible by 3 and by 9. If by some
remote chance it is not immediately clear to you whether the sum of the digits is
divisible by 3 or 9 (perhaps because it might still be too large a sum), then take
the sum of the digits of this just-found sum and continue the process until you
can visually make a determination of divisibility by 3 or 9.
Now that you are an expert at determining whether a number is divisible by 3
or 9, we can go back to the original question about the divisibility of the
restaurant bill of $71.22. Can it be divided into three equal parts? Because 7 + 1
+ 2 + 2 = 12, and 12 is divisible by 3, then we can conclude that $71.22 is
divisible by 3. (Notice that we need not be concerned with the decimal, since it
is the number comprised of the digits with which we are concerned.)
In case you are interested as to why this rule actually works, here is a brief
explanation using very simple algebra. Consider the base-10 number N = ab,cde,

where the letters a, b, c, d, and e represent the digits and, therefore, the value of
the number can be expressed as follows:
N = 104a + 103b + 102c + 10d + e = (9 + 1)4a + (9 + 1)3b + (9 + 1)2c + (9 +
1)d + e. Gathering those multiples of 9, we get
N = [9M + (1)4]a + [9M + (1)3]b + [9M + (1)2]c + [9 + (1)]d + e (where
9M indicates a different multiple of 9 each time).
Factoring these multiples of 9, we get N = 9M[a + b + c + d] + a + b + c + d
+ e, which implies that the entire expression will be divisible by 9 when the sum
of the digits a + b + c + d + e is divisible by 9.
Let us now consider if there is an analogous special property for divisibility
by 11. If you have a calculator at hand, the problem is easily solved. But that is
not always the case. Besides, there is such a clever “rule” for testing for
divisibility by 11—one that it is worth knowing just for its charm.
The rule is quite simple:
If the difference of the sums of the alternate digits is divisible by 11,
then the original number is also divisible by 11.
This sounds a bit complicated, but it really isn't. Let us take this rule a piece at
a time. “The sums of the alternate digits” means you begin at one end of the
number, taking the first, third, and fifth, digit (and so on), and add them. Then
you add the remaining (even-placed) digits. Subtract the two sums, and then
inspect this resulting difference for divisibility by 11.
Perhaps it might be best to demonstrate this through an example. Suppose we
test 768,614 for divisibility by 11. The sums of the alternate digits are: 7 + 8 + 1
= 16 and 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.
The difference of these two sums is 16 – 16 = 0, which is divisible by 11.
(Remember, 
) Therefore, we can conclude that 768,614 is divisible by 11.
Another example might be helpful to firm up an understanding of this
procedure. To determine whether 918,082 is divisible by 11, we once again find
the sums of the alternate digits: 9 + 8 + 8 = 25 and 1 + 0 + 2 = 3. The difference
of the two sums is 25 – 3 = 22, which is divisible by 11, and so the number
918,082 is divisible by 11. Here we have an example of a technique that not only
can be helpful but also demonstrates the power and consistency of mathematics.
We would be remiss if we did not provide a justification for this rather-
unexpected technique for determining whether a number is divisible by 11. Here

is a brief discussion about why this rule works as it does. Consider the base-10
number N = ab,cde, where the letters a, b, c, d, and e represent the digits and,
therefore, the value of the number can be expressed as
N = 104a + 103b + 102c + 10d + e = (11 – 1)4a + (11 – 1)3b + (11 – 1)2c +
(11 – 1)d + e.
If we let 11M represent a number which is a multiple of 11 (and it can be a
different number each time, but still a multiple of 11), we can express the above
equation as: N = [11M + (–1)4]a + [11M + (–1)3]b + [11M + (–1)2]c + [11 + (–
1)]d + e or N = 11M[a + b + c + d] + a – b + c – d + e, which implies that
divisibility by 11 of the number N is dependent on the divisibility of a – b + c –
d + e, which written another way, is (a + c + e) – (b + d), which is actually the
difference of the sums of the alternate digits.
Having now considered rules for divisibility by these two special numbers, 9
and 11, let's consider other properties that these numbers have, to simplify our
arithmetic processes. Perhaps one of the simplest mathematical tricks is to
multiply by 11, mentally! This trick often gets a rise out of the unsuspecting
mathematics-phobic person, because it is so simple that it is even easier than
doing it on a calculator.
