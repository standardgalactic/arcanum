measurement of time by determining the lengths of the day, the month, and the
year. A year is defined as the interval of time between two passages of the earth
through the same point in its orbit in relation to the sun. This is the solar year. It
is approximately 365.24217 mean solar days. The length of the year is not
commensurable with the length of the day; the history of the calendar is
essentially the history of the attempts to adjust these incommensurable units in
such a way as to obtain a simple and practical system.
The calendar story goes back to Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome,
who introduced a year of 300 days divided into 10 months. His successor, Numa
Pompilius (753 BCE–673 BCE), added 2 months to this calendar, which was
used for the following six and a half centuries, until Julius Caesar (100 BCE–33
BCE) introduced the Julian calendar, which has a regular year of 365 days
divided into 12 months. Every fourth year, a day is added to February, making
the fourth year a leap year. Thus, the Julian year is on average 365.25 days long.
The Julian calendar was widely spread abroad, along with other features of
Roman culture, and it was generally used until 1582. If the solar year's length
were indeed 365.25 days, then the introduction of an additional day once every 4
years would completely compensate for the discrepancy. The difficulty with this
method of reckoning was that 365.25 was not the same as 365.24217, which is
the actual time for the earth's revolution about the sun. Although it may seem an
insignificant difference, in hundreds of years it would accumulate to a
discrepancy of a considerable number of days. The Julian year was somewhat
too long, and by 1582 the accumulated error amounted to 10 days.
Pope Gregory XIII tried to compensate for the error. Because the vernal

equinox occurred on March 11 in 1582, he ordered that 10 days be suppressed
from the calendar dates in that year so that the vernal equinox would fall on
March 21, as it should. When he proclaimed the calendar reform, he formulated
the rules regarding the leap years. The Gregorian calendar designates leap years
as those that are divisible by 4, unless they are divisible by 100 and not 400.
Thus, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100,…are not leap years, while the year 2000 was a
leap year, since it is divisible by 400. In the Gregorian calendar, 400 consecutive
years (for example, from 1700 to 2099) contain 97 leap years, three less than in
the Julian calendar. The mean length of a Gregorian year is therefore 
 days.
In Great Britain and its colonies, the change of the Julian to the Gregorian
calendar was not made until 1752. In September of that year, 11 days were
omitted. The day after September 2 was September 14. It is interesting,
therefore, to see a copy of the calendar for September 1752 taken from the
almanac of Richard Saunders—better known as Poor Richard's Almanack (see
fig. 1.7).17
Figure 1.7.
Mathematicians have pondered the question of the calendar and tried to
develop ways of determining the days of any given date or holiday. To develop a
method for determining the day, we need to be aware that a calendar year (except
for a leap year) is 52 weeks and one day long. If New Year's Day in some year
following a leap year occurs on a Sunday, the next New Year's Day will occur on
Monday. The following New Year's Day will occur on a Tuesday. The New

Year's Day of the leap year will occur on a Wednesday. Since there are 366 days
in a leap year, the next New Year's Day will occur on a Friday, and not on a
Thursday. The regular sequence is interrupted every 4 years (except during years
whose numbers are evenly divisible by 100 but not evenly divisible by 400).
Let's first try to develop a method to find the weekday for dates in the same
year. Suppose February 4 falls on Monday. On which day of the week will
September 15 fall? Assuming that this calendar year is not a leap year, one need
only find the number of days between February 4 and September 15. We first
find that February 4 is the 35th day of the year and that September 15 is the
258th day of the year. (Table 1.5 expedites this.) The difference of 258 and 35,
that is, 223, is the number of days between dates. Since there are 7 days in a
week, divide 223 by 7, which yields 
 or, stated another way, 31 with a
remainder of 6. The 6 indicates that the day on which September 15 falls is the
sixth day after Monday, which is Sunday. In the case of a leap year, one day
must be added after February 28 to account for February 29.
Table 1.5.
A similar method for finding the weekday of the dates in the same year can be
discussed as follows. Because January has 31 days, and 
 the same date in

the subsequent month will be 3 days after that day in January. The same date in
March will also be 3 days later than in January. In April, it will be 6 days later
than in January. We can then construct a table of index numbers, as shown in
table 1.6, for the months that will adjust all dates to the corresponding dates in
January:
Table 1.6.
The index numbers in table 1.6 provide the days between the months divided
by 7 to get the excess days, as we did in the previous method. We need only add
the date to the index number of the month and divide by 7, and then the
remainder will indicate the day of the week. Let's consider an example. Suppose
we use the year 1925. January 1 was on a Thursday, so we shall try to determine
on which day of the week March 12 will fall. To do this, add 12 + 3 = 15. Then
divide that sum by 
 with a remainder of 1. This indicates that it was on the
same weekday as January 1, a Thursday. In leap years, an extra 1 has to be added
for dates after February 29.
You may now want to find the day for a date for any given year. To do this, we
first need to know on what day of the week January 1 of the year 1 fell, and also
make adjustments for leap years. The day of the week on which January 1 of
year 1 fell can be determined as follows. Using a known day and date, we find
the number of days that have elapsed since January 1 of the year 1. Thus, since
January 1, 1952, was on a Wednesday, in terms of the value of the Gregorian
year, the number of days since January 1 is 1951 · 365.2425 = 712588.1175.
Dividing by 7, we get 101,798, with a remainder of 2. The remainder indicates
that 2 days should be counted from Wednesday (the day of the week on which
Jan. 1, 1952 fell). Since calculations refer to the past, the counting is done
backward, indicating that January 1 of year 1 (in the Gregorian calendar) fell on
Monday.
One method for determining the day of the week for any year suggests that
dates in each century be treated separately. If you know the day of the week of
