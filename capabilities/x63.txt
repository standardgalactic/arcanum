Further, the following is a partial list of artists who are often mentioned in
connection with the golden ratio:
Paul Signac (1863–1935)
Paul Sérusier (1864–1927)
Piet Mondrian19 (1872–1944)
Juan Gris20 (1887–1927)
Otto Pankok21 (1893–1966)
While it is known that Paul Sérusier not only knew about the golden ratio but
also indicated it in his sketches, Gris, Mondrian, and Pankok have flatly denied
using it.
Many admirers of the golden ratio and the Fibonacci numbers would be
disappointed to learn that the careful examination by the art historian Marguerite
Neveux at the end of the twentieth century removed many pictures from the
“golden ratio list.” She analyzed x-ray pictures of various canvases and came to
the conclusion that most of the artists divided their canvas into eighths before
starting their work. There are many ways to use these fractional partitions; yet,
more often than not,  is selected. So, if this art historian eliminated some art
from the “golden ratio list,” we can still claim them to the “almost golden ratio
list” as they used two consecutive Fibonacci numbers that can generate a rough
approximation of the golden ratio. It is truly fascinating how this “magical”
golden ratio has attracted artists over the centuries—sometimes deliberately and
other times intuitively. Oftentimes, it is for the viewer to make the judgment of
its appearance.

PERSPECTIVITY IN ART
The challenge of capturing perfect depth perception in drawings is often
attributed to the earliest artists of the Renaissance. Most credit for initiating the
study is attributed to the Italian architect and designer Filippo Brunelleschi
(1377–1446) and to the Italian writer and artist Leon Battista Alberti (1404–
1472), who with their writings and artistic renditions opened new vistas for
themselves and future artists as well. This can be best seen through some of the
most famous early examples of this technique.
Over the centuries there have been many renditions of The Last Supper by
famous painters. As time went on, these artists pursued attempts at capturing
proper depth perception in their paintings. A technique in art that allows perfect
depth perception is referred to as perspectivity. It is believed that of the many
renditions of The Last Supper paintings, the first one that captured true and
complete perspective, was the famous Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, with his
mural in the Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. We see the lines of perspectivity
in figure 7.21, surrounding Jesus's head. Actually, when the lines are extended to
where they all meet, studies have shown that they converge on Jesus's right eye,
which could then be considered the center of perspectivity.
Figure 7.21. The Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci.
In figure 7.22, we show the various lines that allowed Leonardo da Vinci to
capture true perspectivity in his painting.

Figure 7.22.
Leonardo da Vinci kept a record of his work in many notebooks. There he
described three factors that also affected perspective appearance. These were:
color, size, and disappearance, which could be considered objects somewhat less
sharp in the rear of the picture than those in front. One illustration of this is his
1508 painting The Virgin of the Rocks, which is shown in figure 7.23.

Before exploring other masterpieces, let's digress and understand what
perspectivity means from a purely geometrical standpoint. In figure 7.24, we say
that the segment AB and the segment DC are in perspective at point P, which is
their center of perspectivity. The term perspective was likely introduced from
optics, since the eye placed at P would see the point D coinciding with the point
A, and the point C coinciding with the point B. Furthermore, the line segment

DC would appear to coincide with the line segment AB. This will allow us to
understand this concept as it has been used by artists to create their masterpieces.
Figure 7.24.
It is well-known that Leonardo da Vinci spent a lot of time analyzing his
artwork, which can be seen very clearly with his perspectivity study of The
Adoration of the Magi. This is shown in figure 7.25, where we notice the lines of
perspective are drawn in by the artist himself.
