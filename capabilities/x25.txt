Now try this formula on the $24 investment made in 1626! Assuming annual
compounding at 6 percent per annum, you have A392 = 24(1 + .06)392 =
199,576,970,308. This means that the original $24 is now worth almost $200
billion! Can you believe the huge difference between this figure and the figure
$588.48 obtained by computing simple interest?
Most banks now compound not annually but quarterly, monthly, daily, or
continuously, so we shall next generalize the formula A = P(1 + r)t to take into
account compounding at more frequent intervals. Bear in mind that if interest is
compounded semiannually, the periodic rate would be only one-half the annual
rate, but the number of periods would be twice the number of years; so
Likewise, if the interest is compounded quarterly, we have

In general, if the interest is compounded n times a year, the formula would be
which can be used for any finite value of n. Letting n = 4 in our original problem
yields
The $24 has now risen to about $330 billion! Notice that changing the
compounding from annually to quarterly increased the yield by about $130
billion. You may now wonder whether the yield can be increased indefinitely by
simply increasing the frequency of compounding. A complete treatment of this
question requires a thorough development of the concept of limits, but an
informal, intuitive approach will suffice here. We shall first explore the simpler
problem of an investment of $1 at a nominal annual interest rate of 100 percent
for a period of one year. This will lead us to
You should now prepare a table of values for A for various common values of
n, such as n = 1 (annual compounding), n = 2 (semiannual), n = 4 (quarterly),
and n = 12 (monthly). Notice that the amount A does not rise astronomically as n
increases, but rather rises slowly from $2.00 (n = 1) to about $2.60 (n = 12). The
amount A would approach, but not quite reach, the value $2.72. Explaining this
limiting value takes us a bit out of the realm of this book. (Yet, for the more
advanced reader, it is
Since investments generally do not earn 100 percent interest, we must convert
to a general interest rate, say, r. By letting 
 we have n = kr and
 which then becomes
Clearly, as n approaches infinity, so does k, since r is finite, so the expression in

brackets approaches the value e as a limit (e is the base of natural logarithms and
has a value of approximately 2.7182818284590452353602874713527…). You
then have the formula A = Pert for instantaneous compounding, where r is the
nominal annual rate of interest and t is the time in years. You might be interested
in knowing that this formula is a special representation of the general law of
growth, which is usually written in the form N = N0ert, where N represents the
final amount of a material whose initial amount was N0. This law has
applications in many other areas such as population growth (of people, of
bacteria in a culture, etc.) and the radioactive decay of elements, in which case it
becomes the law of decay, as N = N0e-rt.
Completing the investment problem, using 2.72 as an approximation to e, you
have A = 24(2.72).06(392) = 399,274,766,704. So you can see that the “ultimate”
return on a $24 investment (at a nominal annual interest rate of 6 percent for 392
years) is almost $400 billion!
Banks currently offer much lower interest rates, and compounding is
commonly done quarterly, monthly, daily, or continuously. You can work
problems with varying principals, periodic rates, frequencies of compounding,
and time periods, and compare yields. You may be surprised at the outcomes!
THE RULE OF 72
We often want to know how a certain interest rate in a bank will affect our total
holdings. Naturally there are traditional ways of calculating interest, which we
have just experienced in the previous section. However, there is an unusual quirk
of our number system that allows us to calculate how long it will take to double
your money in a bank with a daily compounding procedure at any given annual
percentage rate. The procedure is as fast as you can divide 72 by another
number. This is clearly good to know, but it is the unusualness of this rule that
compels us to exhibit it here. It is called the “Rule of 72,” as it is based on this
number. Let's explore this further.
The “Rule of 72” states that, roughly speaking, money will double in  years
when it is invested at an annual compounded interest rate of r percent. So, for
example, if we invest money at an 8 percent compounded annual interest rate, it
will double its value in 
 years. Similarly, if we leave our money in the bank
at a compounded rate of 2 percent, it would take 36 years for this sum to double
its value. You might want to better understand why this is so, and how accurate it
really is. The following discussion will explain that.

To investigate why or if this really works, we consider the compound-interest
formula
where A is the resulting amount of money and P is the principal invested for n
interest periods at r percent annually.
We need to investigate what happens when A = 2P.
The above equation then becomes 
(1)
It then follows that
