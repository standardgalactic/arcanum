example, the famous German opera composer Richard Wagner was born in 1813
(and the sum of the digits of this year is 13), and his name consists of 13 letters.4
Wagner was first motivated toward his life's work at a performance of Carl
Maria von Weber's opera Der Freischütz on October 13, 1822. Wagner
composed 13 operas. One of his operas, Tannhäuser, was completed on April 13,
1845, and was first performed in Paris during his exile from Germany on March
13, 1861. He spent 13 years in exile for political reasons. Wagner's last day in
the city of Bayreuth, Germany, where he had built his famous opera house, was

September 13, 1882. His father-in-law, the Hungarian composer Franz Liszt
(1811–1886), saw Wagner for the last time on January 13, 1883. Wagner died on
February 13, 1883, which just happens to be the 13th year of the unification of
Germany. Curiosities such as these bring another dimension of entertainment to
numbers.
UNEXPECTED BIRTHDAY MATCHES
In our everyday lives, we might consider the likelihood of something happening
or not happening. This often goes under the heading of how probable or how
likely something is to happen. The topic of probability can explain many things.
Yet one of the most surprising results in mathematics—and one that is quite
counterintuitive—is the question of how likely it is for two people to have the
same birthdate (just month and day, ignoring the year). When you find out the
likelihood of this happening, it will surely upset your sense of intuition. On the
other hand, it is one of the best ways to convince the uninitiated about the
“power” of probability.
Let us suppose that you are in a group with 35 other people. What do you
think are the chances (or probability) of two people in the group having the same
birthdate (month and day, only)? Intuitively, one usually begins to think about
the likelihood of 2 people having the same date out of a selection of 365 days
(assuming no leap year). Perhaps 2 out of 365? That would be a probability of 
 A rather-minuscule chance.
Rather than our group of 35 people, let's consider the “randomly” selected
group of the first 35 presidents of the United States. You may be astonished that
there are two with the same birthdate: the eleventh president, James K. Polk
(November 2, 1795), and the twenty-ninth president, Warren G. Harding
(November 2, 1865).
You may be surprised to learn that for a group of 35 people, the probability
that two of them will have the same birthdate is greater than 8 out of 10, or 
If you have the opportunity, you may wish to try your own experiment by
selecting 10 groups of about 35 members in each group and check for birthdate
matches in each group. For groups of 30 people, the probability that there will be
a match of birthdates is greater than 7 out of 10, or, put another way, in 7 of
these 10 groups there ought to be a match of birthdates. What causes this
incredible and unanticipated result? Can this really be true? It seems to go
against our intuition.

To relieve you of your curiosity, we will consider the situation in detail.
Let's consider a group of 35 people. What do you think is the probability that
one selected person matches his/her own birthdate? Clearly certainty, which we
express as a probability of 1. This can be written as 
The probability that another person in the group does not match the first
person is 
The probability that a third person does not match the first and second person
is 
The probability of all 35 people not having the same birth date is the product
of these probabilities:
Since the probability (q) that two people in the group do have the same
birthdate and the probability (p) that two people in the group do not have the
same birthdate is a certainty, the sum of those probabilities must be 1. Thus, p +
q = 1.
In this case,
In other words, the probability that there will be a birthdate match in a randomly
selected group of 35 people is somewhat greater than  This is quite unexpected
when you consider there were 365 dates from which to choose. If you are feeling
motivated, you may want to investigate the nature of the probability function.

Notice how quickly “almost certainty” is reached. With about 60 people in a
room, the chart indicates that it is almost certain (0.99) that two of them will
have the same birthdate.
Were you to do this with the death dates of the first 35 presidents, you would
notice that two died on March 8 (Millard Fillmore in 1874 and William H. Taft
