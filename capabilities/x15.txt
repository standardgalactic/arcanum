by 7 we continue the process.
We take the resulting number 87,640 and delete its units digit, 0, and subtract
its double, still 0, from the remaining number; we get 8,764 – 0 = 8,764. This did
not change the resulting number, 8,764, as we seek to check for divisibility by 7,
so we continue the process.
Again, we take the resulting number 8,764 and delete its units digit, 4, and
subtract its double, 8, from the remaining number; we get 876 – 8 = 868. Since
we still cannot visually inspect the resulting number for divisibility by 7, we
continue the process.
Continue with the resulting number 868 and delete its units digit, 8, and
subtract its double, 16, from the remaining number. Doing this, we get 86 – 16 =
70, which is clearly divisible by 7. Therefore, the number 876,547 is divisible by
7.
Before we continue with our discussion of divisibility of prime numbers, you
ought to practice this rule with a few randomly selected numbers and then check
your results with a calculator.
Why does this rather-strange procedure actually work? The beauty of
mathematics is that it clearly explains why some amazing procedures actually
work. This will all make sense to you after you see what is happening with this
procedure.
To justify the technique of determining divisibility by 7, consider the various

possible terminal digits (that you are “dropping”) and the corresponding
subtraction that is actually being done by dropping the last digit. In the chart
below you will see how dropping the terminal digit and doubling it to get the
units digit of the number being subtracted gives us in each case a multiple of 7.
That is, you have taken “bundles of 7” away from the original number.
Therefore, if the remaining number is divisible by 7, then so is the original
number, because you have separated the original number into two parts, each of
which is divisible by 7, and, therefore, the entire number must be divisible by 7.
Terminal Digit
Number Subtracted from Original
1
20 + 1 = 21 = 3 · 7
2
40 + 2 = 42 = 6 · 7
3
60 + 3 = 63 = 9 · 7
4
80 + 4 = 84 = 12 · 7
5
100 + 5 = 105 = 15 · 7
6
120 + 6 = 126 = 18 · 7
7
140 + 7 = 147 = 21 · 7
8
160 + 8 = 168 = 24 · 7
9
180 + 9 = 189 = 27 · 7
Table 2.2.
Now that we have a better understanding of why this works for divisibility by
7, let's examine the “trick” for divisibility by 13.
The rule for divisibility by 13: This is similar to the rule for testing
divisibility by 7, except that the 7 is replaced by 13 and, instead of
subtracting twice the deleted digit, we subtract nine times the deleted
digit each time.
Let's check for divisibility by 13 for the number 5,616. Begin with 5,616 and
delete its units digit, 6, then multiply it by 9 to get 54, which is then subtracted
from the remaining number: 561 – 54 = 507. Since we still cannot visually
inspect the resulting number for divisibility by 13, we continue the process. Take
the resulting number, 507, and delete its units digit and subtract nine times this
digit from the remaining number: 50 – 63 = –13. We see that –13 is divisible by
13, and, therefore, the original number is divisible by 13.
You might be wondering why we take the unit digit and multiply it by 9. To
determine the “multiplier,” 9 in this case, we sought the smallest multiple of 13
that ends in a 1. That was 91, where the tens digit is 9 times the units digit. Once

again, consider the various possible terminal digits and the corresponding
subtractions in the following table.
Terminal Digit
Number Subtracted from Original
1
90 + 1 = 91 = 7 · 13
2
180 + 2 = 182 = 14 · 13
3
270 + 3 = 273 = 21 · 13
4
360 + 4 = 364 = 28 · 13
5
450 + 5 = 455 = 35 · 13
6
540 + 6 = 546 = 42 · 13
7
630 + 7 = 637 = 49 · 13
8
720 + 8 = 728 = 56 · 13
9
810 + 9 = 819 = 63 · 13
Table 2.3.
In each case, a multiple of 13 is being subtracted one or more times from the
original number. Hence, if the remaining number is divisible by 13, then the
original number is divisible by 13. Let's move on to another prime number.
Divisibility by 17: Delete the units digit and subtract five times the
deleted digit each time from the remaining number until you reach a
number small enough to determine its divisibility by 17.
We justify the rule for divisibility by 17 as we did the rules for divisibility by
7 and 13. Each step of the procedure subtracts a “bundle of 17s” from the
original number until we reduce the number to a manageable size and can make
