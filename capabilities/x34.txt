which is the probability that no identical pairs will evolve from the two decks of
cards. Or, stated another way, the probability that an identical pair will evolve is
somewhat less than two-thirds. This is truly for most people counterintuitive,
and, further, it shows how probability becomes an integral part of higher
mathematics, as it invoked the famous constant e. By the way, we should note
that Euler was also responsible for labeling the ratio of the circumference to the
diameter of a circle with the Greek letter π. Both numbers are irrational, since

they cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers. As with the value π, the
value e is also considered a transcendental number, since it is not the root of any
non-zero polynomial with rational coefficients.
MATHEMATICS IN POKER
Now that we have a basic grip on the concept of probability, let's apply it to
perhaps one of the most popular card games, five-card poker. As a refresher, we
shall quickly review the game in its most simple fashion. Each player is dealt
five cards, and the one who holds the best hand wins. In descending order the
best hands are: a royal flush (a straight up to the ace in one suit), four of a kind, a
straight flush, full house, flush, straight, three-of-a-kind, two-pair, one-pair, and
the highest card.
To begin, let us consider the number of possible poker hands that one could
have been dealt from a deck of 52 cards. In other words, we seek to find the
number of combinations of 5 cards possibly dealt from a deck of 52 cards. We
represent that as 52C5, which is 
 = 2,598,960.
Royal Flush
Let's now consider each of the above-listed winning poker hands in order
according to their likelihood of occurrence, or, put another way, their probability
of happening. The royal flush consists of the ace, king, queen, jack, and 10, all
of the same suit. Suppose we consider the ace of spades. There is then only one
possible group of four cards that would complete a royal flush in spades.
However, there are 4 suits that qualify for a royal flush. Thus, there are only four
possible royal flushes that one could get. The probability of a royal flush is,
therefore, 
P(royal 
flush) 
= 
 
= 
1.53907716932927 
· 
10–6 =
0.00000153907716932927, or about 0.000154 percent. This indicates odds of 1
in 649,739 chances, written as 1:649,739. To obtain these odds, we calculate in
the following way: the four successful events as compared to the unsuccessful
events 2,598,960 – 4 = 2,598,956, which can be written as 4:2,598,956; then,
dividing by 4, we get: 1:649,739.
Straight Flush
To find the probability of getting a straight flush (excluding the royal flush),
which is having all five cards in consecutive order of the same suit, excluding

the highest five consecutive numbers, we will order the cards from highest to
lowest. We begin with the king, because if we use the aces as the highest, then
the five consecutive cards would represent a royal flush, which we already
considered above. There are then nine possibilities for a straight flush in each of
the 4 suits, that is, 9 · 4C1 = 9 · 4 = 36. Therefore, the probability of getting a
straight flush is P(straight-flush) = 
 = 1.38516945239634 · 10–5, or 1
chance in 72,192 tries.
Four of a Kind
We're now ready to find the probability of obtaining four of a kind, which is four
cards showing the same number or letter. Suppose we arrange the cards in a five-
card hand such that the four of a kind will be the first four cards. There are 13
possible such hands, and there are 48 cards remaining in the deck to sell the fifth
position in the hand. Therefore, we have 13 · 4 · 48 = 624 possible hands of four
of a kind. Thus, the probability of obtaining four of a kind is P(four of a kind) = 
=.00024009603842, which yields odds of 1:4,164.
Full House
Now we want to find the probability of getting a full house, which consists of
obtaining three cards of one number or letter and two cards of another. There are
13C1 = 13 ways of getting the first number of the three-of a kind, and there are
three out of four possible suits, which yields 
 possibilities. For the pair
that will complete this hand, we have 12C1 = 12 possibilities of the number that
can be shown on the two cards. As for the suits of this pair, we have 4C2 = 6
possibilities.
We then have the probability of getting a full house as P(full house) = 13C1 ·
C4 · C3 · C12 · C1 · C4 · C2 = 13 4 12 6 = 3744. To determine the probability of
getting a full house, we divide that number by the total number of possible
hands: 
 or, expressed as odds, 1 : 693.
Flush
Now we move along to our next more-likely hand to obtain, which is having five
cards of the same suit. This is called a flush, excluding the straight flush that we
already considered above. There are 4 choices to pick a suit. Within that suit of
13 
cards, 
the 
number 
of 
ways 
we 
can 
choose 
five 
cards 
is 

 From this number, we need to subtract the 10
straights that might occur, so that we get the number of flushes as: 4C1 ·(13C5 –
10) = 4 · 1277 = 5,108. In order to calculate the probability of getting a flush, we
