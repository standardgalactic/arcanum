c), and 2b > a, you should first try to place net A vertically or, if this is not
possible, horizontally. If 2b < a, then you should try the horizontal orientation
first. The final option is to place net B horizontally. Assuming that c is much
smaller than w and therefore w – 2c ≈ w (which would be the case if the item to
be wrapped is a book, for instance), in table 3.7 we show the best choice and
orientation for different ranges of w.
Table 3.7.

If a = b and c is much smaller than a, that is, if the cuboid has the shape of a
relatively flat square, then there exists an alternative method to wrap the item.
This method not only is more efficient but also makes the present look nicer.
You need a square piece of paper with sides of length √2 (a + c), where √2 =
1.414…, which we can round up to 1.42 here (or, being a bit more generous, to
1.45). You then fold the paper in half two times and in alternate directions to get
guidelines for placing the item (see figure 3.23). Now the trick is to place the
cuboid in the middle of the square piece of paper with its corners on the
guidelines, as we show in figure 3.23, and fold up the corners of the wrapping
paper. They all should meet in the center, and you need only a tiny bit of tape to
affix them (the small amount of excess paper along the sides of length c is easy
to cover). There are no overlapping folds of wrapping paper needed, which
makes the present look particularly nice.

At this point, we hope that you will have become a much more clever
consumer, both geometrically and arithmetically. However, cleverness has
another role in our mathematical world, and that involves probability. Continue
with this on our journey as we enter another realm of mathematics that helps us
navigate our world by making the right decisions in games, gambling, and
beyond.

The concept of probability plays a very important role in our society today. Yet it
all began in 1654 when two famous French mathematicians, Blaise Pascal
(1623–1662) and Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) corresponded about the chances
of winning in a then-popular dice game.1 The game consisted of tossing a pair of
dice 24 times to determine whether to bet even money that at least one of those
24 tosses will result in a pair of sixes. It was believed then that getting a pair of
sixes during these 24 throws was a good bet, yet the opposite resulted from the
correspondence between these two famous mathematicians. They further
corresponded about such gaming outcomes, which eventually led to determining
the mathematical field of probability, which was formalized in 1657 by the first
book published in this field by the Dutch mathematician Christian Huygens
(1629–1695), titled De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae. The continued study of
probability has led to many unusual results, which we shall consider in this
chapter.
FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH!
The number 13 is usually associated with being an unlucky number. Buildings
with more than thirteen stories typically will omit the number 13 from the floor
numbering. This is immediately noticeable in the elevator, where there is no
button for 13. You can certainly think of other examples where the number 13 is
associated with bad luck. This fear of the number 13 is often referred to as
triskaidekaphobia. Among the more famous people in history who suffered from
triskaidekaphobia are Franklin D. Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and Napoleon
Bonaparte.2
You will likely recall that when the 13th of a month turns up on a Friday, there
are some folks who believe that there could be particularly bad luck on that day.

This may derive from the belief that there were thirteen people present at the
Last Supper, which resulted in Jesus's crucifixion on a Friday. Do you think that
the 13th falls on a Friday with equal regularity as it does on the other days of the
week? You may be astonished that, lo and behold, the 13th comes up more
frequently on Friday than on any other day of the week.
This fact was first published by the American mathematician Bancroft H.
Brown (1894–1974) in American Mathematical Monthly.3 He stated that the
Gregorian calendar follows a pattern of leap years, repeating every 400 years.
The number of days in one four-year cycle is 3 · 365 + 366. So, in 400, years
there are 100(3 · 365 + 366) – 3 = 146,097 days. Note that the century year,
unless divisible by 400, is not a leap year; hence the deduction of 3. This total
number of days is exactly divisible by 7, which you can determine by using the
divisibility rule shown in chapter 1. Since there are 4,800 months in this 400-
year cycle, the date of the 13th comes up 4,800 times. Interestingly enough, the
13th comes up on a Friday more often than on any other day of the week. The
following chart (table 4.1) summarizes the frequency of the 13th appearing on
the various days of the week. Here we have a conundrum: the day that occurs
most frequently is considered bad luck!

There are some people who were not consciously affected by the number 13
but have had much of their lives involving this rather-famous number. For
