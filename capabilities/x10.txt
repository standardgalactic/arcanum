the first day of that period, you could, in the same fashion as before, determine
the excess days after that day of the week (thus, the day of the week that a given
day would fall on for that century). For the years 1900–1999, the information
needed is:

1. The index numbers of the months (see table 1.6).
2. January 1 of 1900 was Monday.
3. The number of years (thus giving the number of days over the 52-week
cycles) that have elapsed since the first day of the year 1900.
4. The number of leap years (i.e., accounting for additional days) that have
occurred since the beginning of the century.
If we know this, we can ascertain how many days in that Monday-week cycle
we need to count. To better understand this, consider the following example. We
seek to determine on which day of the week May 9, 1914, fell. Begin by adding
9, which is a number of days in the month, to the number 1, which is the index
number of the month, to the number of years, 14, and to the number 3, since
there were three leap years to that date in that century. Therefore, we get 9 + 1 +
14 + 3 = 27. We then divide by 7, which leaves a remainder of 6, and that
indicates a Saturday.
As another example, let's try to determine on which day of the week August
16, 1937, fell. Here we begin by considering the following numbers for the sum:
there were 16 days in the month up until that date; the index number for August
is 2; 37 years have passed since the century began; and there were 9 leap years
prior to that date. Thus, we get the sum 16 + 2 + 37 + 9 = 64, which, when
divided by 7, leaves a remainder of 1, which indicates a Monday.
For the period 1800–1899, the same procedure is followed, except that
January 1, 1800, was on Wednesday. For the period September 14, 1752 (the day
after the deduction of 11 days), through 1799, the same procedure is followed
except that the first day of that period would be Friday. For dates before
September 2, 1752, we do not have to treat dates in each century separately,
since the Julian calendar applies, and thus the number of leap years that occurred
until a certain date in any century is just the integral part of the number obtained
by dividing the year by 4. Otherwise the same procedure is followed, except that
the whole year would be added and the number of the days would start with
Friday. You can see how if we apply our procedure to determine the day of the
week that May 13, 1240, appeared, we would get the following sum: 13 + 1 +
1240 + 310 = 1564. Then, dividing by 7 leaves a remainder of 3, indicating that
May 13, 1240, was a Sunday.
There is another method for determining the day without having to consider
separate periods. Again we start by knowing the day of January 1 of the year 1.
We will not count the actual number of days that have elapsed since January 1 of
year 1, but we will count the number of excess days over weeks that have
elapsed and to this number we will add the number of days that have elapsed

since January 1 of the given year. This total must be divided by 7, and the
remainder will indicate the number of days that must be counted for that week;
thus, we can establish a formula as follows:
1 (Monday) + the remainder of the division by 7 of (the number of years
that have elapsed thus far + the number of days that have elapsed since
January 1 of the given year + the number of leap years that have occurred
since year 1) = the number of the day of the week.
The calculation of the number of leap years must take into account the fact
that the years whose number ends with two zeros, and which are not divisible by
400, are not leap years. To better understand this, consider the following
example: let's determine the day of the week on which the date December 25,
1954, fell. Here is a calculation: 1+1953+488 (leap years) – 15 (century wrongly
assumed leap years 19–4)+358 (number of days between January 1, 1954, and
December 25, 1954) = 2785, which, when divided by 7, gives a remainder of 6.
Thus, December 25, 1954, fell on the sixth day of the week: a Saturday.
Many other tables and mechanisms have been devised to solve the problem of
determining days. One such, shown in figure 1.8, consists of four scales and is to
be used as follows:
1. With a straightedge, join the point on the first scale indicating the date with
the proper month on the third scale. Mark the point of intersection with the
second scale.
2. Join this point on the second scale with the point on the fourth scale
indicating the proper century. Mark the point of intersection with the third
scale.
3. Join this point with the point indicating the appropriate year on the first
scale. The point of intersection with the second scale gives the desired day
of the week. (Note: For the months of January and February, use the year
diminished by 1.)

The problem of a perpetual calendar occupied the attention of mathematicians,
many of whom devoted considerable attention to calculating the date of Easter
Sunday. We will address this in the next section.
HOW WE OVERLOOK OUR CALENDAR
Most of us are in daily contact with our calendar. However, there are certain
peculiarities about the calendar that we ought to be aware of so that we can
appreciate more than just looking up the day of the week. We really ought to
know more about the calendar than the obvious. These little surprises can be
used for entertainment purposes, or just to appreciate the construct of our
calendar.
Consider any calendar page, say, October 2019. A randomly selected 3 · 3
square array of numbers is shown in table 1.7.

Table 1.7. October 2019.
Now focusing on the shaded dates, we will add 8 to the smallest number (9) in
the shaded region and then multiply that sum by 9 to get (9 + 8) · 9 = 153. If we
now multiply the sum of the numbers of the middle row (which is 51) of this
shaded matrix by 3, surprise! We get the same answer at which we previously
arrived, 153. But why? Here are some clues: the middle number is the mean (or
average) of the 9 shaded numbers, which is in itself a neat curiosity. The sum of
the numbers in the middle column is ⅓ of the sum of the nine numbers. An
enthusiastic reader will likely want to justify these curiosities.
There's still more to admire about our calendar. What do you think the
likelihood is that the following dates will all be on the same day of the week?
The dates in question are: 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12 (where 4/4 represents
April 4th, 6/6 represents June 6th, and so on). Much to most people's surprise,
