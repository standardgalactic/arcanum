divide this number by the total number of possible hands dealt, which is
2,598,960. Therefore, P(flush) = 
 and so the chances of getting
a flush are about 1 in 508, or written as odds, 1:508.
Straight
As expected, we will now consider the probability of getting a straight, yet we'll
exclude the straight flush. Once again, we see that there are 10 possibilities of
getting a straight, where the ace can be either the highest card or the lowest card.
Once we know what the first card is, the remaining cards are clearly determined.
Since each of the cards can be of a different suit, each can be selected in four
ways. Therefore, the number of straights obtainable is equal to 10 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 ·
4 = 10,240. From this we need to subtract the number of straight flushes and
royal flushes, which gives us 10,240 – 36 – 4 = 10,200. Therefore, the
probability of getting a straight (but not a flush) is P(non-flush straight) = 
 which translates to approximately one chance in 255
possibilities, or 1:254. The odds are defined as the ratio “(chances for):(chances
against)”; therefore, one chance in 255 possibilities amounts to odds of 1:254, as
there are 255 – 1 = 254 chances against the event. We didn't subtract the 1 when
we calculated the odds for the better poker hands we considered before, since the
difference between both ratios would have been negligible. However, as we
move on to more-likely poker hands, we can't ignore the difference between
probability and odds anymore.
Three of a Kind
The next more-likely hand to obtain is to get three of a kind among the five cards
dealt, with the remaining two cards not matching in number. Let's consider the
first of the 3 cards that will be matching a number. There are 13 possible
numbers that this first card could have. We will also have 4C3 = 4 ways in which
we can select the suits of these three cards. The remaining 2 cards in our hand
must be different from the first 3 cards and different from each other, which
implies that there are 12C2 choices for these cards, in addition to which each of
these cards can be of any one of 4 suits. Therefore, the number of possible hands
containing three of a kind is 13C1 · 4C3 · 12C2 · 4C1 · 4C1 = 13 · 4 · 66 · 4 · 4 =

54,912. When we divide this number by the total number of possible poker
hands, we find the probability of getting three of a kind to be P(three of a kind) =
 which translates to about 1 in 47 chances for getting a hand
with three cards of the same number or letter, or odds of 1:46.
Two Pairs
As we move along, we find even more likely poker hands. This time we will
consider the probability of getting a five-card hand dealt where there are 2 pairs
of the same number or letter. To begin, there are 13C2 ways that the 2 numbers
can be selected to represent each of the 2 pairs. Within each pair, there can be 2
out of the 4 suits, or 4C2 ·4C2 = 6 · 6 = 36 ways to be selected. To avoid having a
full house, the fifth card must be different from these other 2 pairs. There are
11C1 ways to select a fifth card, and it can have any one of the 4 suits. To
calculate the number of ways of getting two pairs, we calculate the following:
13C2 · 4C2 · 4C2 · 11C1 · 4C1 = 78 · 6 · 6 · 11 · 4 = 123,552. Once again, in order
to find the probability of getting a poker hand with 2 pairs, we divide this latter
number by the total number of hands possible to get: P(two pairs) = 
.047539015, which yields odds of about 1 to 20.
One Pair
By now you may have noticed that the odds are continuously becoming more
favorable, or, in other words, you are more likely to get these hands as we move
along. Perhaps the simplest, or perhaps the most likely hand one can be dealt is
getting one pair of cards, showing the same number or letter, with the other three
cards in your hand different from the first two and from each other. Let's
consider the pair of cards matching in number or letter. There are 13 possible
ways that this can have the same number or letter (13C1). The pair will represent
2 of the 4 available suits, or 4C2 = 6 ways that the suits can be selected. The rest
of the cards in your hand must not match the first two cards and can be selected
in 12C3 ways, and may have any one of the 4 suits.
Therefore, the number of ways of getting exactly one pair of matching cards is
as follows: 13C1 · 4C2 · 12C3 · 4C1 · 4C1 · 4C1 = 13 · 6 · 220 · 4 · 4 · 4 =
1,098,240. Once again, when we divide this number by the total number of
possible hands, we get the probability of being dealt a pair of matching cards,
which is P(one pair) = 
 .422569027. This allows us to calculate that the

odds of being dealt one pair is about 1:1.37.
Five Different Cards
The only other possible hand one can be dealt in poker is one in which there is
none of the above occurrences. Therefore, there must be 5 different cards that
can be selected in 13C5 ways, and each of the cards can have any one of the 4
suits, yielding 13C5 · 4C1 · 4C1 · 4C1 · 4C1 · 4C1 = 1,287 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 · 4 =
1,317,888. From this, we subtract the number of straights, flushes, straight
flushes, and royal flushes to get: 1,317,888 – 10,200 – 5,108 – 36 – 4 =
1,302,544. Once again, to find the probability of obtaining this hand, we divide
by the total number of possible hands dealt to get P(only a high card) = 
.501177398, which translates to odds of about 1:1.
Having now considered all of the possible poker hands, the sum of these
probabilities should add up to 1, since a probability of 1 or 100 percent is
equivalent to certainty. If you are dealt any 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards, they
must fall into one of the 10 cases we considered. The sum of their probabilities is
shown in table 4.3.
Table 4.3.
Knowing the chances of getting any of these possible poker hands should
provide you some guidance about how to play the card game cleverly.
MATHEMATICAL LOGIC OF TIC-TAC-TOE
We often overlook that a part of the study of mathematics is based on logic, and
the reverse is also true. This can be seen with the game of tic-tac-toe. Most
people are familiar with the basic game of tic-tac-toe (sometimes called

“Noughts and Crosses” in Great Britain).5 As far back as 1300 BCE traces of the
game could be found in ancient Egypt. But in the Western world the game seems
to have its origins in Rome in the first century BCE, where it was called Terni
Lapilli. There is also evidence that the game might have originated in ancient
Egypt. The first written reference to the name “tick-tack-toe” was a children's
game in 1884. The popularity of the game entered the world of computers in
1975 when as a student project at MIT it was demonstrated that a Tinkertoy
computer was able to play the game perfectly. This is on display at the Museum
