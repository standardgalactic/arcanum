Fechner's experiment has been repeated with variations in methodology many
times, and his results have been further supported. For example, in 1917, the
American psychologist and educator Edward Lee Thorndike (1874–1949)
carried out similar experiments, with analogous results. In general, the rectangle
with the ratio of 21:34 was most preferred. Do those numbers look familiar? Yes,
once again, the Fibonacci numbers appear. The ratio 
approaches the value of ϕ and gives us the golden rectangle.
DISPLAYING A WATCH
We are not often aware of the many places that we experience aspects of the
golden rectangle. For example, in almost all advertisements for watches and
clocks, the hands of the clock show approximately 10:10.

The hands make an angle of 
 minutes, which is the equivalent of 115
degrees (fig. 7.4). (A quick aside to explain how we got this angle: Since 10
minutes is 
 of an hour, the hour hand moved  of the distance from “10” to
“11” from 10:00 to 10:10. Therefore, the hour hand moved  of 5 minute
markers, or  of a minute marker. Thus, the angle at 10:10 is 
 minute markers.
To find the degree measure of that angle, we simply find the part of 60 minute
markers that 
 is, in other words, 
)
Now consider the rectangle formed by placing its vertices at points at which
the hands indicate at 10:10, that is, at minute markers: 2 and 
 We can form a

rectangle (fig. 7.5) with these two points as two adjacent vertices and have the
point of intersection of its diagonals at the center of the watch face. This
rectangle is very close to the golden rectangle, whose diagonals meet at an angle
of about 116.6 degrees. (See fig. 7.6.)
Figure 7.5
Figure 7.6.
This can be determined by using the golden rectangle (fig. 7.6) and finding the
measure of the angle whose tangent function is tan x =  =  = ϕ. That angle, x,
has measure 58.28 degrees. Therefore, ∠AEB = 116.56°, which is very close to
the 115°, is felt by exhibitors to be the ideal placement of the hands of a watch.
Some might have suspected that the 10:10 time placement was to allow the
observer to see in unobstructed fashion the brand name of the watch. Not
necessarily so, as is borne out of the above research, we simply prefer the
appearance of the golden ratio and rectangle.
APPLICATIONS IN ART
The famous Italian painter, sculptor, architect, natural scientist, and engineer
Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) illustrated the book De divina proportione9 (On

the Divine Proportion), which was written by the Franciscan monk Fra Luca
Pacioli10 (ca. 1445–1517). It included an anatomical study of the Vitruvian Man
(fig. 7.7), Vitruvius Pollio (ca. 84 BCE–27 BCE), a Roman armed-forces
technician and engineer who published ten books about architecture and civil
engineering and developed a theory of proportions. Da Vinci included this
illustration to support Pacioli's discussion of Vitruvius's documents about
architecture, in which he represented the proportions of the human body as a the
basis for architecture.
Figure 7.7. Vitruvian Man, by Leonardo da Vinci.
The ratio of square side to circle radius in this famous illustration corresponds
to the golden ratio with a deviation of 1.7 percent.
In 1523, the famous German painter and graphic artist Albrecht Dürer (1471–
1528) relied heavily on Vitruvius's work as he wrote his four books on human
proportions. Here he refined the earlier works and expressed them as a system of
proportions, where the unit of measure is the human body, with the parts
expressed as fractions thereof.
In Dürer's books on geometry, fortress building, and human proportions, he
supported all of his ideas with theoretical arguments and kept his artistic
instincts aside. As a matter of fact, his works in descriptive geometry influenced
some of the greatest thinkers of the Renaissance, including Johannes Kepler
(1571–1630) and Galileo Galilei (1564–1642).
In his famous self-portrait (ca. 1500), Dürer drew himself with a head of wavy
hair whose outlines create an equilateral triangle. This can be seen in figure 7.8,

where Dürer actually superimposes the triangle and several other guidelines over
the self-portrait. The base of the equilateral triangle divides a height of the entire
picture into the golden ratio. The chin also divides the height of the entire picture
into the golden ratio.

By the way, you will notice that when Dürer made his self-portrait (fig. 7.9),
he made it so that his head could be encased perfectly into a golden rectangle.
This is further evidence that Dürer was very aware of some of the techniques
that da Vinci seemed to champion in his artwork: perspectivity and the golden
