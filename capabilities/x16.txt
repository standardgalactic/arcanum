a visual inspection to determine divisibility by 17.
The patterns developed in the preceding three divisibility rules (for 7, 13, and
17) should lead you to develop similar rules for testing divisibility by larger
primes. The following chart presents the “multipliers” of the deleted digits for
various primes.
Table 2.4.
You may want to extend this chart. It's fun, and it will increase your
perception of mathematics. You may also want to extend your knowledge of

divisibility rules to include composite (i.e., non-prime) numbers. Why the
following rule refers to relatively prime factors1 and not just any factors is
something that will sharpen your understanding of number properties. Perhaps
the easiest response to this question is that relatively prime factors have
independent divisibility rules, whereas other factors may not.
Divisibility by composite numbers: A given number is divisible by a
composite number if it is divisible by each of its relatively prime
factors. The chart below offers illustrations of this rule. You should
complete the chart to 48.
Table 2.5.
At this juncture, you have not only a rather-comprehensive list of rules for
testing divisibility but also an interesting insight into elementary number theory.
Practice using these rules (to instill greater familiarity) and try to develop rules
to test divisibility by other numbers in base-10 and to generalize these rules to
other bases. Unfortunately, a lack of space prevents a more detailed development
here. Yet we hope that these above examples have whet your appetite.
A QUICK METHOD TO MULTIPLY BY FACTORS OF POWERS OF 10
We all know that multiplying by powers of 10 is relatively easy. You need only
place the appropriate number of zeros onto the number being multiplied by the
power of ten. That is, 685 times 1,000 is 685,000. However, multiplying by
factors of powers of 10 is just a bit more involved, but, in many cases, it can also
be done mentally. Let's consider multiplying 16 by 25 (which is a factor of 100).
Nothing like a little practice to solidify a new algorithm. Following are a few
more such examples:

In the previous line, in our last step we were able to break up the fraction  as
follows:
In an analogous fashion, we can multiply numbers by 125, since 125 = 
.
Here are some examples of multiplication by 125 done mentally!
When multiplying by 50, you can use 50 = 
 when multiplying by 20, you
can use 20 = 
Practice with these special numbers will clearly be helpful to you, since with
some practice you will be able to do many calculations faster than the time it
takes to find and then turn on your calculator!
ARITHMETIC WITH NUMBERS OF TERMINAL DIGIT 5
We offer now some other possibilities for mental calculation. Not that we want
to detract you from using a calculator, but we wish merely to give you a sense of
understanding and appreciation of number relationships that are part of our
everyday lives.
Suppose we want to square 45. That is, 452 = 45 · 45 = 2025.
The process requires three steps:
Step 1
Multiply the multiples of 10 that are one higher and
one lower than the number to be squared.
40 · 50 = 2000
Step 2
Square the units digit 5.
5 · 5 = 25
Step 3
Add the two results from steps 1 and 2.
2000 + 25 = 2025
Table 2.6.
In case you are curious why this works, we offer a short proof of this by using
elementary algebra. Recall that the square of a binomial (u + v)2 = u2 + 2uv + v2.
We let (10a + 5) be the multiple of 5 to be squared.
Then we have (10a + 5)2 = 100a2 + 100a + 25 = 100a(a + 1) + 25 = a(a + 1) ·
100 + 25, which can be rewritten as 10a · 10(a + 1) + 25, which shows
algebraically just what we did in the three steps above.
Here is an example of how to interpret this for an actual multiplication, say,

175 · 175:
Where a = 17, we get:
x2 = 10a · 10 (a + 1) + 25 = 10 · 17 · 10(17 + 1) + 25 = 170 · 180 + 5 · 5 =
30600 + 25 = 30,625.
Another way of looking at this technique is by considering the pattern that
evolves below. Look at this list and see if you can identify the pattern of the two-
digit numbers squared.
052 = 25
152 = 225
252 = 625
352 = 1225
452 = 2025
552 = 3025
652 = 4225
752 = 5625
852 = 7225
952 = 9025
You will notice that in each case the square ends with 25 and the preceding
digits are determined as follows:
052 = 0025, 0 = 0 · 1
152 = 0225, 2 = 1 · 2
252 = 0625, 6 = 2 · 3
352 = 1225, 12 = 3 · 4
452 = 2025, 20 = 4 · 5
552 = 3025, 30 = 5 · 6
652 = 4225, 42 = 6 · 7
752 = 5625, 56 = 7 · 8
852 = 7225, 72 = 8 · 9
952 = 9025, 90 = 9 · 10
