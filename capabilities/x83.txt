CHAPTER 7: APPEARANCES OF MATHEMATICS IN ART AND
ARCHITECTURE
 1. The equality of two ratios is called a proportion.
 2. We cross multiply, that is, the product of the means equals the product of the extremes.
 3. Euclid, Elements, book 2, proposition 11; book 6, definition 3, proposition 30; book 13, proposition
1–6.
 4. The quadratic formula for solving for x in the general quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 is 
 5. There is reason to believe that the letter ϕ was used because it is the first letter of the name of the
celebrated Greek sculptor, Phidias (ca. 490–430 BCE) [in Greek: (Pheidias) ФEIΔIAΣ or Фειδίας], who
produced the famous statue of Zeus in the Temple of Olympia and supervised the construction of the

Parthenon in Athens, Greece. His frequent use of the golden ratio in this glorious building (see chapter 2.) is
likely the reason for this attribution. It must be said that there is no direct evidence that Phidias consciously
used this ratio.
The American mathematician Mark Barr was the first using the letter ϕ in about 1909—see Theodore
Andrea Cook, The Curves of Life (1914; New York: Dover, 1979), p. 420. It should be noted that sometimes
you will also find the lower case ϕ—or less commonly the Greek letter τ (tau), the initial letter of τομή (to-
me or to-mĭ’) meaning to cut.
 6. A unit square is a square with side length of 1 unit.
 7. Adolf Zeising (1810–1876), a German philosopher, Neue Lehre von den Proportionen des
menschlichen Körpers (New Theories about the Proportions of the Human Body) (Leipzig, Germany: R.
Weigel, 1854). The book Der goldene Schnitt (The Golden Ratio) was published posthumously (Halle,
Germany: Leopoldinisch-Carolinische Akademie, 1884).
 8. Gustav Theodor Fechner, Zur experimentalen Ästhetik (On Experimental Aesthetics) (Leipzig,
Germany: Breitkopf & Haertel, 1876).
 9. Luca Pacioli, De divina proportione (Venezia, 1509; reprinted in Milan in 1896; Gardner Pelican,
1961).
10. Cf. the discussions at the beginning of the chapter 7.2, Sculptures.
11. Dan Pedoe, Geometry and the Visual Arts (New York: Dover, 1976).
12. This actually refers to Giotto di Bondone, Italian painter and master builder.
13. Masaccio is Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone; he is the Italian painter who is regarded as a
founder of Renaissance painting. The Trinity fresco was of pioneering meaning for the mural painting and
the development of the altar because of the central perspective.
14. He was also called Roger de Le Pasture, a Flemish painter.
15. Pietro di Benedetto dei Franceschi, also Pietro Borgliese, Italian painter.
16. Pietro Perugino was born Pietro Vannucci.
17. Michelangelo Buonarroti; Michelangelo was, however, a sculptor, painter, architect, and poet. In
1508, Michelangelo also designed the uniforms of the Swiss guard for the Vatican.
18. Italian copperplate engraver.
19. Painting I and Composition with Colored Areas and Gray Lines 1 (1918) e.g. are often quoted; as
well Composition with Gray and Light Brown (1918; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas), Composition
with Red Yellow Blue (1928).
20. Actually José Victoriano González-Pérez, Spanish painter and graphic artist.
21. German painter, graphic artist, and wood engraver.
