The paragraph discusses Friedrich Nietzsche's exploration of reason, particularly in the context of his work "Thus Spoke Zarathustra." In this narrative, a figure known as the Sensate One or the Higher Man seeks to introduce a broader discussion on these themes. The text highlights that physical pleasures alone are insufficient without order, suggesting that enjoyment can serve as a crucial logical continuation if neither hedonism nor asceticism provides an answer.



Kant finds the foundation for moral experience in reason, positing that if everything in nature is created with maximum economy and appropriate means, then happiness can be conceived as an end. However, desires do not represent instincts aimed at achieving pleasure in a hedonistic sense. Man is endowed with reason and above all, practical reason which drives action and seemingly multiplies intentions. Therefore, the faculty of rationality must be designed to implement moral experience.

The question arises: how can personal experience contain universal obligation? This metaphysical dilemma was resolved through synthetic a priori judgments. Similarly, Kant gives effect to man’s experience of freedom by applying a priori principles that sanctify and determine the will consistently.



The concept of morality should not be determined by inclinations but by respect for the moral law. This precludes inclination as a guide to action and equally prevents defining morality as merely technical knowledge of natural relations, such as acts of necessity according to the moral law; such determination is unnecessary.

However, the human will, driven by desires, requires an imperative—a representation of a ground of action expressed by the norm "ought." It becomes hypothetical if represented as a means to an end but categorical when it is an end in itself. The moral law stems from transcendental experience and recognition of an ultimate reality beyond phenomena or appearances. Therefore, it can be universally mediated only through the categorical imperative.

Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative derives from the conception of the moral law as determining inward necessity from a priori principles: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." This emphasizes acting out of duty expressed in respect for the moral law, not out of personal inclinations or self-control. The categorical imperative stands as an end in itself and is derived from recognizing an ultimate reality beyond mere appearances.



The law of the maximum nation, "Moralistic Purity," could become a mechanism for societal control by revealing its own pretense to be more concerned with a moral high ground than actual ethical behavior. This approach often masks an agenda that serves those in power rather than promoting genuine morality or equality.

Moralistic purity can create divisions within society by emphasizing differences and encouraging people to judge one another based on arbitrary standards of 'moral superiority.' It ignores the complexities of human nature, failing to recognize that individuals and societies are shaped by a variety of influences beyond simple moral dichotomies. Such an approach may inadvertently lead to hypocrisy, as those enforcing these moral standards often do not adhere to them themselves.

The real issue is not just about recognizing morality but understanding how it can be manipulated for control. By focusing on differences rather than commonalities, societies risk fostering division and alienation. The challenge lies in distinguishing between genuine ethical behavior and the use of morality as a tool for manipulation and power dynamics.



Moral actions are determined by the inward compulsion of duty, rather than expediency. The conflict between morality and self-interest becomes immediately apparent when one considers an action that cannot be willed as a universal law of nature. Kant argues that the key to an immoral action lies in the willingness to make an exception for one's inclination, despite recognizing a moral law of universal validity.

Kant's second formulation relies on the distinction between treating humanity as an end in itself and using it merely as a means. He states, "So act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or that of another, always as an end only and never as a means." This concept expresses the recognition and respect for human moral personality, acknowledging the ultimate value of individuals and setting limits on one's actions out of respect for the divine in humanity. It is through these ends that true personal morality is realized, emphasizing tolerance and the intrinsic worth of each person.



The carrying autonomy or ought to wills moral law here every man is both a legislator of universal maxims and subject to rules created by his own autonomy or those of others. The dignity of man, flowing from an awareness of higher responsibility to mankind, provides the foundation for a heteronomy of wills in whom the transcendental vision of freedom has kindled that which has led to the common experience of the moral law.

But how possible is this categorical imperative: it furnishes a conception of man as part of nature—as all indicates—he is ruled by causality. This raises questions about the reciprocal action between volition and natural laws, indicating a tension between autonomy and heteronomy in human conduct. 

For the discussion of this argument, see subsequent sections for further exploration.



It is essential to note that there exists a series of other antinomies. Many attempts have been made to achieve morality, yet certainty in attaining the ultimate goals remains elusive and intuitively one feels the impossibilities involved in such pursuits. One longs for the summum bonum—happiness—to coincide with virtue, but no necessary correlation is guaranteed within the phenomenal world. Duty seems the only motive that can guide humanity in its quest for morality.

Again, Kant returns to the distinction in the Critique of Pure Reason between phenomena and noumena. As far as reason man can be part of the realm of phenomena—subject to real necessity—but not necessarily commensurate with it. In this context, morality does not describe a world where phenomena are bound by necessity alone. Duty appears as the sole guiding principle for humanity's moral journey.



The study explores a unique attitude, an ethic that aims at an experience elevating one above the world of senses into the noumenal reality of the Divine idea. It involves freedom as a possibility asserted by practical reason and postulated by speculative reason. The striving for perfection induced by moral law transcends temporality to effect an endeavor impossible within finite time. God appears as the guarantor or "summum bonum." The postulates of God, Freedom, and Immortality represent an assertion of the pervasiveness of man's moral nature.

The transience and eternal experience of freedom overcome all obstacles offered by empirical reason. Theory and practice unite in the categorical imperative, whose possibility of implementation derives from its very conception.
