This explanation clarifies the nature of civilization's emergence but does not account for its particular occurrence in time or space. What determines these entities' emergence from the stream of humanity remains an open question.



Toynbee examines all possible causes before drawing conclusions. He identifies the negative factors that retard activity, such as "vis inertiae" (inertia) and the "lack of custom," which inherently deter progress. These obstacles serve as a foil for creative action; they are conditions to be overcome before differentiation can occur.

Two obvious alternatives present themselves concerning positive factors. The mutation in human societies could either result from one special quality inherent in humans who succeeded the transition or from a specifically favorable constellation of environmental conditions. According to Toynbee, neither hypothesis is tenable as it relies on a construction shaped by human prejudice—an aspect of the ego-centric delusion for which no scientific criteria can be found. Its general acceptance derives partly from the Protestant concept of predestination, which considers material success an indication of divine sanction and attributes deficiency to all disbelievers. This notion is reinforced by racial theories developed from de Gobineau's ideas, whose primary concern was not the validation of natural phenomena but political polemic.

Against the self-evidence of the first assumption can be set the fact that race feeling represents a significant bias in understanding human progress and achievement.



Relatively recent western phenomena, such as the concept of racial equality, were not present in the medieval period. The potential equality of all humanity constituted a cornerstone of popular belief at that time. Moreover, no connection can be established between the pigmentation of the skin and the creative tendency that issues into the Yang state.

An empirical survey suggests that all races except the Negro race have, at one point or another, produced civilization. However, this comparison proves that such deficiency may not be inherent but could result from various socio-economic factors in different historical contexts.

The environmental theory fares no better. Its only conclusion is consistent with the notion that external conditions affect development. 

This analysis highlights the complexity of attributing creative potential to racial or environmental factors alone.



Toynbee aimed to examine the genesis of civilizations and determine whether they were operative wherever they occurred. Such an empirical survey would reveal a wide variety in the geographical and climatic conditions that accompanied the genesis of civilizations. Although the Egyptian and Sumerian civilizations developed in river basins, not every river, such as the Colorado River, has produced a civilization. Similarly, though the Eurasian prairie and Arabian peninsula have been productive agricultural lands, they did not produce nomadic societies. The Sahara served as an obstacle to the birth of civilization.

If both race and environmental theories are discounted, what accounts for the genesis of civilizations? Toynbee found the solution in a combination of these two factors. Empirical proof by simile suggests that while similar environments have yet to produce civilizations elsewhere, this is indicated by Toynbee's assertion. The Minoan Island-Empire was not developed in Indonesia; however, recent history may demonstrate the weakness of this argument.



Race, while not its sole cause, represents the manifestation or anomaly that philosophers call "elan vital" and the mystical God. The Environment, again, constitutes an omnipresent obstacle thwarting this force and chaining it to battle. The interaction between Race and Environment is illustrated in the story of God and the Devil, which parallels the plot of the Book of Job. 

The genesis of civilizations results not from one factor but several; it arises not from an entity but a relation. The interaction that causes the Yin state to change to Yang is the theme of much profound mythology. An encounter between beings with superhuman titles constitutes the plot of theological versions as well as scientific assumptions. This encounter, such as between Yahwe and the devil in the story of Genesis, retains the same inherent meaning in the New Testament as the pattern of Redemption.

A catastrophic impact of stars serves as a matrix on which physical science constructs its image of the origin of the Universe. Both accounts agree in conceiving the encounter as a rare and unique event with consequences of unimaginable potency.

The plot begins with a perfect state or Yin. For both theology and mythology, this interaction is conceived as a pivotal moment.



The argument concerning Toynbee's metaphysics is central to his overall thesis. In this context, Toynbee challenges Spengler by asserting that human history does not follow a predetermined cycle but rather evolves through creative responses to challenges. This distinction underscores Toynbee's belief in the potential for renewal and progress within civilizations.

In contrast to Spengler's deterministic view, which suggests that cultures inevitably decline after reaching their peak, Toynbee emphasizes the role of "creative minorities" who can inspire a civilization to transcend its limitations. This idea is illustrated by his interpretation of biblical narratives, such as the perfect goodness of Adam and Eve before the Fall, symbolizing an ideal state from which humanity can strive to return through conscious effort and moral development.

Toynbee's method involves analyzing historical patterns while highlighting the capacity for human agency and innovation. His approach suggests that civilizations are not bound by fate but have the potential for regeneration and growth if they successfully address their existential challenges. This perspective offers a more optimistic view of history, emphasizing adaptability and resilience over inevitability and decay.



The concept of the "creative factor" in certain theories involves expressing the function of a catalytic element in interactions with the environment. In mythology, the intrusion of the Devil into God's realm serves as an impetus for transitioning to the Yang state. The Lord and Satan make a pact that is then tested on human agents such as Job and Abraham, representing civilizations at a stage where they have just attained their feet and begun to climb the ladder toward full awareness of the dangers of ascent without pause—where death represents the only alternative to achieving the next level.

However, mythology and theology suggest that the attainment of knowledge is inevitable; the question arises whether God has thus challenged the Devil without risking anything. Denying this would negate the essence of their encounter and its vast consequences. According to some interpretations, the Devil's intervention serves to disrupt equilibrium but cannot achieve a new level of interaction. God, yearning for an opportunity for creation in the perfection of Eden but finding none, is given a chance through these divine tests. This dynamic underscores the profound implications of such mythological narratives.
