The school of thought aligned with the empiricist tradition emphasizes the mind's capacity to receive impressions from experience, as opposed to possessing innate ideas—a concept developed by philosophers like John Locke and later David Hume. This line of thinking ultimately led to a form of metaphysical skepticism.

According to this view, knowledge is based on experience, while reasoning reveals only habitual expectations of recurrent associations. Cause and effect are understood as representations of constant conjunctions of events, rather than intrinsic connections between them. This perspective concludes that our understanding of causality is merely an expectation formed from repeated observations, not a definitive insight into the nature of reality.



To exhibit the necessary connection between regular events A and B, it is essential to observe their consistent conjunction in experience. This means that whenever event A occurs, event B follows with a reliable regularity. Hume argues that our ideas of causation arise from this habitual observation rather than any intrinsic necessity we perceive directly.

In other words, the connection we infer between cause (A) and effect (B) stems from witnessing their constant conjunction in experience, not from any inherent understanding or reasoning about them as separate entities. This challenges the notion that causation is something evident through reason alone; instead, it highlights how our concept of necessary connections emerges from empirical observation.

Thus, we recognize regularities between events due to repeated associations over time, forming an expectation that one event will follow another based on past experiences rather than any a priori knowledge.



The central epistemological point of ultimate reality meaningfulness is reflected in Hume's ethics as a metaphysical assertion. This perspective aligns with Spinoza's concept of the intellectual love of God, which entails an understanding that his system operates on necessary logical principles.

Post argues for a necessary sensibility to freedom within rational beings. Their adoption of Spinozistic ontology implies recognition of the logical necessity inherent in their systems. While Humean moral sense was based on a pleasing sensibility—the faculty of benevolence whereby humane impulses receive inward approval—this reflects an underlying social utility.

The re-examination of these ideas shows that both philosophies, while distinct, emphasize an internal consistency and necessary logic within their frameworks. The alignment with or deviation from Spinoza's principles highlights a broader metaphysical dialogue on the nature of ethics and reality.



From dependency on uncertain metaphysical assumptions, both empirical conclusions drawn by thinkers like Hume and Toynbee illuminate differing interpretations of motivation through survival. For Hume, moral sanction is conceived as an indication of utility, while for Toynbee, it emerges as a manifestation of Divine grace. However, Hume's metaphysical skepticism prevents him from attributing ultimate purposes to phenomena, whereas Toynbee’s theological convictions allow him to find divine imprints in historical events.

Kant’s dilemma thus reflects our original paradox under the guise that rationalism asserts reason's supremacy, limiting freedom to recognition or objective necessity and considering manipulative knowledge as the only ethical criterion. The quest for knowledge was based on analytic a priori judgments, intuitively derived, which claimed to encompass the whole truth within themselves and presented themselves as the objective pattern of reality. Yet, this attempt ultimately revealed limitations.



The Concepts of Meaning for a Dialectic between Objective and Subjective Notions

For an exploration of this theme, see Appendix A "The Sense of Responsibility."

In his work "Critique of Judgment," Immanuel Kant refers to this as a determinant judgment. The endeavor to achieve certainty through the analysis of innate ideas often resulted in missed opportunities for many significant achievements of internal consistency. Rationalists were compelled to abstract from the experiences of reality to ascertain the minimal formal objective notion of external reality and its relation to innate ideas, which was unsolvable within their formulation. The irony of the rationalist position is best expressed by their ultimate recourse to inward experience: subjective certainty as the final criterion for the validity of their judgments.

Empiricism, on the other hand, faced a dilemma despite the commonness of its analyses of ordinary thought processes and judgment. Its judgments lacked the universality that forms the foundation of ideation. Basing cognition solely on empirical experience risks overthrowing one's concepts with each new experience; a cataloging of feelings or instances could only provide an account at a superficial level.

Kant, therefore, was faced with alternatives: freedom as a function of reason and understanding versus determinism governed by phenomena. He proposed bridging the gap between rationalist innatism and empirical skepticism through his critical philosophy, introducing the concept of synthetic a priori judgments that combine elements of both approaches to form universal principles grounded in subjective experience yet applicable objectively.

In doing so, Kant aimed to establish a dialectic balance where objective knowledge is informed by innate structures of understanding while being tested against sensory experiences, thus integrating the strengths and addressing the weaknesses of both rationalism and empiricism.



**The Question of Freedom in a World Governed by Natural Laws**

How can we reconcile freedom with necessity? How do moral maxims impact political events, and what is the relationship between history and freedom? These questions were central to Immanuel Kant's exploration of metaphysics.

Kant believed that the mechanical description of nature did not exclude a conception of its transcendental immanence. However, this immanence was understood as a datum of inward experience rather than a category of reason. Although limited by knowledge, there is room for an explanation of his moral philosophy. Kant reconciled the antinomy between necessity and freedom through recognition of life's meaningful alternatives based on an explicit moral attitude. Man can find justification for conduct only within himself, not as an attribute of external reality.
