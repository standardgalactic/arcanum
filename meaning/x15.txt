Essence as a negation of time, just as its history was episodic—masses of detail but no inner relation—it clung to the coast of the Mediterranean in clusters of tightly organized city-states with no serious attempt to explore the hinterland. Settling far from the coast would have meant losing touch with home.

The immigration into the U.S., the lonely pioneering in the West, and the explorations of a Columbus or Marco Polo were beyond the possibilities of Classical Man. The Apollinian culture grew in the process of actualizing its life-symbol of pure bodily presence and so died without knowing it through its lack of historical perspective.

Spengler dates the history of Western culture from around 900-1000. At that time, the fear of the end of the world, the continued yearning of the Carolingian period, and the dark groping during the migrations suddenly coalesced, and the Western soul appeared with an essence as a striving into infinity, a passionate drive to overcome all limits and to lose itself in the quest for the eternal. Its representative for Spengler is the Faustian man—an integer of force, will, and action at a distance—a lonely ego in an endless void, realizing time as an arena of direction, projecting his determination into all his activities. In almost every respect, this emerging culture represents the polar opposite of the Apollinian. The Greek gods dwell on Olympus, "but Valhalla is nowhere—an eternal resting place with its harmonious God and heroes being the very symbol of solitude."



The Faustian culture, too, was marked by a great refusal. Like other civilizations that were inwardly disconnected and remote, it took over the religion of Christianity from the West but remodeled those concepts to fit its dynamic yearning. It replaced the theology of God's substantiality with a passionate assertion of the Father-God as Force, characterized by constant activity, beyond human comprehension.

The longing of the young soul, its feeling of care and determination to prevail across generations, coalesced into a specific creation: the Mother Mary. Her crowning in Heaven became one of the earliest motifs in Faustian art. She evolved from a light figure in blue, the smiling dispenser of Grace, culminating in the festival among English Benedictines celebrating the Immaculate Conception, completing Bernard of Clairvaux's work.

Yet this world of plurality and happiness also involved the counter-creation of early Gothic—the realm of the Devil. Lurking behind Mary’s infinite understanding, he was ever ready to tempt, lead astray, or destroy the soul. The late condition of cultural development spared Western man, according to Spengler, from the terrifying fear that once hung over humanity—the fear of falling into an abyss where witches abounded and black magic reigned. Night feasts on mountain tops and charm formulas were common.

A perpetual war had to be waged against the prince of Hell and his fallen angels. Witches confessed to witchcraft, genuinely believing it to be true and inquired with tears in their eyes, sentenced to the pyre—for that was their hell, not death. This explains the sense of guilt permeating all Gothic longing.

The cathedrals rose ever more pleadingly toward heaven; vaults turned into hands folded in prayer, offering little help through the stained windows illuminating semi-darkness and naves. Man was a lonely Ego lost in the infinite, surrounded by powers of darkness. For Roman man, heaven was impending, but for Faustian man, it was infinitely far. There arose an ever-finer differentiation of notions, a desire to lose oneself, a universal cry for Grace that bound the will.



To be transcendent to God is the highest desire of man. The sacraments, elevated into dogma by the undying spirit of St. Augustine, reveal their deepest significance in their transformation of the meaning of the altar sacrament into an assertion of free being. This results from the concept of one who sacrificed himself to ensure freedom for others.

The Sacrament of Contrition represents the noblest manifestation of Faustian world-longing. While baptism grants one a new life or humanity, contrition is the recognition of the uniqueness of personality, which alone determines the value of the act. Each man can search only his own conscience. The release and bliss given by this sacrament constitute one of the profoundest sources of unending freedom for the individual.



The passage seems to be a reflection on religion during times of crisis, particularly in relation to insecurity resulting from decline.

Religion often provides comfort and stability in times of uncertainty. As societies face significant challenges or crises, many people turn to religious beliefs for solace and guidance. This can result in an increased interest or reliance on religion as individuals seek meaning and reassurance amid turmoil.

The passage references the work of Max Weber, a sociologist known for his analysis of modern society and its institutions. Weber discussed how shifts in social structures, such as those occurring during periods of economic decline, could lead to changes in religious behavior and beliefs. These dynamics reflect broader patterns where religion can become more prominent when traditional sources of security are perceived to be failing.

In summary, the passage suggests that religion plays a crucial role during crises by offering a sense of continuity and support when other systems appear unstable or unreliable.



The sacrament caused Mary's world of light to fade, leaving only the devil's realm behind. The concept of the priesthood of all believers is one that a few strong souls can achieve. However, this is only in terms of duties and not powers, as no man ever confesses with the inward certainty of absolution.

The Pauline yearning for release from longing, coupled with an expression of the conviction that "to understand all is to forgive all," finds its outlet in various forms of art. This includes Rembrandt's self-portraits, Bach's compositions, and above all, Beethoven's music—each serving as a confession of a tormented soul seeking release.

Yet, even within this tension, an overemphasis on the Ego leads to a loss of the felt unity with oneself.



The beginning of the "Late" stage of Culture is marked by an awareness described as Faustian, characterized by a feeling that evaluates actions based on the doer rather than the deed. This psychology views forces of willing, feeling, and thinking as striving for dominance in a dynamic ontology. Faustian art embodies this yearning for infinity. Although its early manifestation was architectural, stone—with its affirmation of the body—could never serve as the final expression of the Western soul. Michelangelo passionately groped in this direction.

Only through the tension between physical form and spiritual aspiration can we understand the evolution of his creations.
