The dynamic duality between science and magic, especially in alchemy, often involves extracting results from a substance that, ultimately, represents merely a different aspect of the divine.

At a time when critical philosophy and active research were supreme, the old enigmas reappeared. The same elements that brought natural science to its peak suddenly became a solvent for deeper questions. Each culture discovers that ultimate questions remain unanswerable. For instance, the problem of motion is unresolved; force as the source or cause of motion represents Western dilemmas and classical causality.

The hypothesis grows progressively more complex as these issues are explored further.



As various fields of knowledge increasingly converge, a painful clarity emerges amidst all abstraction. With ever sharper definition of conceptual quantities—which also determine the structure of experience *a priori*—there appear only the myths of springtime in modern form.

In the grey light at the beginning of civilization, man realizes that the tension created by his waking consciousness has become too great. The quest for knowledge is endless, and his tired soul plunges into the peace of a second religiosity. Yet where early religion was the grand symbol of an emerging soul, the citizen of modernity, with the cosmic beat in him ever decreasingly, clings desperately to his cults, his theology, his religious faith. In springtime, reason was felt as support for faith; in maturity, faith no longer prevails over reason but is nuanced by it.



The belief that there exist criteria beyond formal proofs is fundamental. Some argue for a mystical constitution of actuality, not reducible to logical formalism.

As culture itself becomes civilized and the world seeks relief from polarities within its soul through phenomena like empires, circuses, dances, and sports, Caesarism emerges in political organization, replacing democracy, which has become an empty shell. It ends dictatorship by money, now the real master of political life. This represents the triumph of blood and instinct over the strained waking-consciousness of the urban elite.

Pure power, the ceaseless rhythm of ever-becoming, reasserts itself and, despite traditional traps, even because of them, permeates all aspects of political life as an unstoppable force. According to Spengler, nothing can save the dying civilization. The sterility of late men ensues—a meta...



The physical turn toward fate that is tragic symbolism in Shakespeare could transform an incident into destiny becomes the problematization of social events in Ibsen. In this context, woman, whom the man of Springtime culture conceives as the mother of his children, constitutes for the Cosmopolitan a companion for life, an object for the blending of dispositions. However, no sincere attempt can arrest the decline in population. Neither the marriage laws of Augustus nor the wholesale adoptions, nor the incessant implantation of barbarians, availed to check this process in the Hellenic world.



When reasons have to be put forward in a question of life, life itself has become problematic. The normal element, the trained waking consciousness, has consumed the plant's potential for future usefulness that binds organicism together at an end. The population returns to a primitive state similar to that of the Spartans during Roman times or the Chinese and Indians.

This reflects on how society can revert to more fundamental, less complex states when confronted with deep existential questions. This return signifies a stripping away of layers of modern understanding, exposing a core that resembles ancient cultures in its simplicity and directness.



Today, all that once was known as gramhas has ceased to exist, and the biological sequences spanning millennia have re-emerged. Waking consciousness has succeeded in stiffening development, in petrifying the great symbol 5m. Just as in living culture the state and race are in antithesis—comparable to the impersonal and the persona—the opposition now lies between the mass and the caste: the formal against the informal.

The intelligence, subtlety, and dignity of this former world may be considerably understated by an Indian Brahmin looking down on a Westerner. However, its history has ceased for civilization; it has become an object for cultures and peoples who will to be destiny, as the period of contending states has left it physically and morally exhausted.

"And so high history lays its hand down weary to sleep.
Man becomes a plant again, adhering to the soil, dumb and enduring. The timeless village and the eternal peasant reappear, begetting children and burying in Mother Earth—a busy, not inadequate swarm over which the tempest of passing soldiers blows. In the midst of the land lie the old world cities, empty receptacles of an extinguished soul, where a history-less mankind slowly nests.

Men live from hand to mouth with petty thrills and fortunes and endure. Masses are trampled in the conflict of these conquerors who contend for the power and spoil of this world, but the survivors fill up the gap with primitive fertility and suffer on. And while in high places there is the eternal alternation of victory and defeat, those in the depths pray, praying with that mighty piety of the Second Religiousness that has overcome all doubt forever.

There, in the souls' world-peace, the peace of God, the bliss of grey-haired monks and hermits becomes actual.



The passage explores a profound observation about human endurance in suffering, comparing it to historical experiences. It suggests that this endurance is unrivaled, occurring only at the end of "grand History," where something holy and aimless returns—a concept likened to the natural cycles of stars, earth, and ecosystems. This notion emphasizes an intrinsic purposelessness yet holds a noble essence.

The text then transitions into discussing how cultures serve as organic entities with life spans defined by their youth problems and experiences. Each culture constructs its worldview, shaping possibilities in science and religion, setting boundaries for what can be achieved. Occasionally, the tension from dominant forces becomes overwhelming, causing a culture to transform into a civilization before eventually returning to its biological origins once its purpose is fulfilled.
