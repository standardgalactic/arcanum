Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, a German philosopher known for his work on nature philosophy and transcendental idealism, provides insights into this realm through his writings. His commentaries contribute significantly to understanding these concepts. Additionally, C. J. Friedrich's introduction and commentary further elaborate on these philosophical ideas.



Through his mature experience, not through any analysis of the meaning of existence, man attains a vision of a higher world-order. This enables Kant to redefine Christianity on the basis of a transcendental intuition without attempting—like Toynbee—to claim the sanction or external reason for its errors.

Kant's exploration in the "Critique of Pure Reason" suggests that God speaks directly through the categories of reason, rather than moral experience alone. In later life, Kant considered this approach, allowing him to conceptualize a form of Christianity grounded in transcendental intuition. This perspective avoids making claims based on external authority or empirical evidence, aligning with his philosophical principles.

By focusing on internal rational insights and the conditions for possible experience, Kant provides an interpretation that is both profound and aligned with his broader critical philosophy.



For all law is holy and presupposes a will directly determined by its commands, yet all men can achieve in this life is a rightful disposition and longing for the blessing of holiness. The yearning for holiness therefore postulates eternity. The order of nature can offer no happiness as an inducement for the performance of the moral law. But the Christian concept of the Kingdom of God opens vistas of profound peace, in which terrestrial striving dissolves in the blessedness of inward peace.

In God's kingdom and same love, one sees not under a harsh or demanding lord but as the bosom friend of an ethical command of loving kindness. Pathological love cannot be commanded; but a feeling of respect for the experience of the moral law, compelling one to do one’s duty based on an a priori concept expressed in the categorical imperative, amounts to an aporetic achievement that constitutes the true meaning of Kant's philosophy.

Kant has come full circle. His Critique of Pure Reason leads us back to understanding the intrinsic motivation behind ethical actions.



Publishing an analysis of the ethical limits of knowledge regarding reality's edge, by the first room distinction as a guideline on face, be it moral experience. The transcendental experience of freedom gives meaning to the concept of a will determined to action by a priori considerations. The kingdom of ends emerges, and an affirmation of man's dignity becomes the goal of ethical activity.

The rationalistic formulation of Kant's categorical imperative lies in a mysterious relationship with a supersensible world-order, in a reflective apprehension that is otherwise unattainable. This alone makes the categorical imperative operative, but for necessity, it applies only to a specific attitude; its universality presupposes the prior experience of the moral law.

This must be kept in mind when considering the origin of Kant's ethics by Schweitzer and Sartre. Although they differ in their interpretations, both acknowledge that while they may diverge in approach, the fundamental experience of moral law is essential for understanding ethical behavior.



The arguments presented by Scheler and Sartre are remarkably alike. Scheler criticizes Kant's categorical imperative, arguing that its attempt to achieve universality comes at the cost of vitality and practical applicability. According to Scheler, it becomes so vague as to lose all meaning.

Sartre restates this argument in practical terms. He cites the case of a young Frenchman torn between joining the Free French forces under General Charles de Gaulle or staying with his family during World War II. This scenario illustrates the difficulty of applying abstract moral principles to concrete situations, supporting Scheler's critique of Kantian morality as lacking vital relevance and clarity in real-life contexts.



There is a dilemma according to Sartre, in which whatever decision he made, he would treat someone—either himself or his mother—as merely a means. Deeply imprinted on this example is the confusion involved in this interpretation of Kant's philosophy as if it should be a manual providing technical solutions for all problems of existence. But life’s dilemmas are not to be reconciled by manipulation. Ethical conduct must reveal a personality, not mastery over causal connections. Kant understood this and based his moral philosophy on a transcendent, or practical, experience. This implies that the categorical imperative can give conditions only to prior moral experiences. Its universality expresses a feeling of responsibility towards humanity; its obligation testifies to a vision of an ultimate reality.

The existentialists are right in their assertion that life involves action. However, their demand for philosophy to offer absolute certainty tends to deny the uniqueness of the individual. The experience of freedom in a determined world requires that we transcend necessity only by imparting our individuality to the inexorable unfolding of events. The existentialists' emphasis on activity, however, reduces to an atom buffeted by fate—doomed to swirl in concentric circles until a stable conclusion is achieved through understanding or causal laws. This confuses a physical state with an ethical role.

Similarly, Scheler wants ethics to be a necessity of thought. This too expresses a quest for certainty in an uncertain world—a claim to wrest out intellectual constructions such as immortality, which the experience of directedness denies. The necessity of thought cannot occur in a vacuum. The moral life is thus deeply connected with individual experience and personal responsibility beyond rigid constructs.



The tension in existence is not a refutation of the categorical imperative. No one can ever feel the soul's dilemma in the ultimate crisis of life like another person. Man must solve his problem with dignity, but alone. The categorical imperative perspective can guide an attitude only if preceded by a transcendental experience of freedom. But experiences are personal and no outsider can possibly prescribe their content. Love is unique only to the lover. Therefore, philosophy can never create an ethical system that constitutes necessity or thought or provides technical solutions for all of life's problems. It is human experience, responsive, motivational. It is one's own force vector toward its own meaning through action in existence. It sustains itself and transcends through its own initiatives and the transcendence of love.
