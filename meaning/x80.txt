The reign into an inexorable Fate can Homer's heroes achieve freedom—a harsh assertion, however. As the wonder went out of the Hellenic world and the exultation in war (still noticeable in the Iliad) left only its horrors behind, when man began to feel apart from society—an unthinkable notion in Homer—the question of fate emerged as the central problem of the meaning of freedom.

Virgil's Aeneid testifies to this endeavor. Aeneas represents the moral man; his tremendous sadness reflects ease and simplicity. He symbolizes the essential struggle between duty and personal desire, highlighting the complex nature of human freedom under divine influence. Through Aenea’s journey, only those who are steadfast and pious can navigate through life's ordeals to fulfill their destined path.

Empire and history reveal a tension between fate and a quest for moral ideals to validate all striving. In this process, the objectivity of Homer and Virgil's histories reveals an inevitable triumph of good over evil in terms that are possible. Their heroes must possess the absolute inner spontaneity of Homeric characters. A moral decision now serves as the justified standard either by objective necessity or divine intervention.

This narrative reflects the essential human struggle between accepting fate and striving for a moral ideal, suggesting that true heroism involves both recognizing one's destiny and asserting personal moral agency to overcome evil.



Virgil finds freedom in the determination of will by duty, expressing a moral sanction. However, this sanction adheres to which scheme of necessity? The Augustan Empire provided no answer. Virgil's extensive sadness testifies to a valuable reality without salvation by faith. In this inner uncertainty, Virgil's gods become undignified, his longing pervasive and hopeless.

The medieval period found an answer in Dante’s work. Dante gave meaning to freedom as a recognition of necessity by attributing divine sanction to it. While hints exist in Homer—Zeus in the Iliad appears to represent the conscience of mankind—he is ultimately unable to save either Hector or Sarpedon. Athena tells Penelope that Telemachus will escape the woes he has not sinned against God but rather represents a fleeting hope rather than an explicit affirmation of meaningful divine sanction.

To Dante, on the other hand, life revealed a divine plan. There was no need for the creation of a representative creator of a meaningful universe; its manifestation in all specificity was already achieved. Freedom is the recognition of divine immanence under the guidance of reason. The pilgrim's arrival in Paradise witnesses a complete fusion of will, desire, and reason in a blend of transcendental bliss.

This birth, this wonder at the miracle of creation and the meaningfulness of fate makes Dante more comparable to Homer than to Virgil, testifying to a young culture that can still see the mystery in life. The divine sanction ascribed to necessity makes its recognition and true liberation, lifting man above the sensual world.

"This man has come in search of liberty," Virgil tells Cato. When the will comes to its inward realization of limits, expressed by the Confession at the River Lethe, true freedom is attained, and terrestrial bounds fall away. Dante now rises above the determined necessity of the physical world and ascends through the heavens. Now he meets the Saint whose ambiguous appearance in the moon is both necessary and willed: "In His Will Is Our Peace."



Life to Dante appears as a process of achieving freedom in a world of transcendental truths and purposefulness, pervaded by divine action to necessity. Grace, the force that unbinds the will, represents God's gift to mankind and its possibilities symbolized by Beatrice. The pilgrim’s journey, even in the most desperate moments, enables one to will freely yet in accordance with God's wisdom and eternal grace. This underscores a profound understanding of freedom aligned with divine necessity.



This passage discusses a reconciliation with materiality, considering it insignificant in light of a faith that transcends phenomenal necessity through spirituality. Milton gives divine sanction to necessity but represents a later period when the world appears more familiar, yet inward doubts persist despite assurance by faith. The problem Virgil faced reemerges: freedom becomes an abstract concept rather than an experience.

Milton argues this at great length without pause or doubt. The inward assertion of our will's reconciliation with necessity is evident; however, the entire tendency denies this. Freedom is seen to reside in the evaluation of objective conditions and choices available within those constraints. Milton emphasizes that true freedom involves understanding and navigating these limitations rather than experiencing an unbounded liberty.



The necessity in Milton's work is not experienced inwardly like Dante's bliss at seeing the mystical procession, but derives from a shrewd analysis of divine power. Adam’s recognition of lines does not arise from a state of ecstasy but rather from an understanding of God's infinite patience with man's shortcomings. There is a greater focus on God's wrath and man's inherent sinfulness. The concern with materiality becomes pernicious, as it makes a difference whether the physical world is conceived as a norm or inherently evil. In either case, material conditions are exalted. God and Christ become humanized and speak in the fashion of Homeric war-lords. The role of Mary has gone out of life, offering no hope for a struggling humanity. Milton's hero cannot find peace and contrition because he is in a continuous state that does not climax to an inward experience. No Beatrice lights the way through a now joyless existence. Only the world of the devil remains, connected by a bridge to earth, ever threatening, ever tempting, unconquerable for man who looks for his freedom outside himself.

The priesthood of all believers in Milton is a concept that opens vistas of duties only. Milton's notion of freedom reveals a continuous struggle to achieve true humility by overcoming materialism, with a recognition of necessity transferred to the environment. Grace represents not an ultimate condition of bliss but merely a right to struggle.

The vision of freedom contained in these poems reveals a recognition of limitations on apprehension and necessity that also reflect a process of aging in history. While one can discern a major feat of conceptual freedom expressed in the development from Homer's externalized divinity to Milton's internalized divine association, there are subsidiary movements of growth and decline in inwardness, wonder at the world followed by limitation, frustration, pain, and misery. Virgil and Milton testify to this dynamic engagement with history and the groping that occurs when a valley that was once marvelous becomes common and ordinary over time.
