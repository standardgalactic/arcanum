When we consider life's purpose, it often eludes us. Today, everyone is busy with various activities. However, which truly matter? What do we think were the most significant moments of our lives that we've lost touch with as we age and grow older?

Living in a civilization can have no bearing on the ethical content of one’s conduct if our view of the world derives from a mystical relationship to the Infinite. The state of civilization doesn't alter the essence of our actions.

If we must experience freedom before implementing judgments, then there are no merely technical solutions for the dilemmas of the soul available through reason alone. 

Does this mean that mysticism offers the only solution to the problems of existence with reason in the role of a proposer of alternatives? Our distinction between objective and inward demand unfolds in two stages: Reason discloses the objective necessity—the inexorability of causal laws and logical links which enable man to master his environment, presenting them as a technical task and instilling an instrumental utility.

In their sphere, they may achieve much. However, this raises questions about deeper existential meanings that go beyond reason's capacity to address.



The tremendous progress has opened vistas of worlds that even the most optimistic thinkers of the late nineteenth century would scarcely believe. However, knowledge of objective necessity has definite limits; it is confined to a naturalistic mechanism in which the scientist does not directly participate. Action derives from an inward necessity, from the personal conception of the environment and the unique apprehension of phenomena. Consequently, objective necessity can never guide conduct, and any activity reveals a personality.

Reason helps us understand the world we live in, but rational social theory can only assist by developing institutions that make inner experiences possible. Nothing can relieve man from his ultimate responsibility: giving his own meaning to life, elevating himself above necessity through the significance he ascribes to organic immortality or existence itself.

For this reason, political scientists should cease condemning not living up to certain standards; instead, they should understand the fatedness of historical events and the disenchantment that accompanies civilization's growth. However, history is unable to provide inspiration because inevitability is a poor guide. Man lives with purposes and in his hopes glimpses realities beyond mere phenomena. Success and failure are relative attributes, meaningful only in retrospect and never finally decided. But the attitude accompanying activity testifies to a character, to the intrinsically unique which man imparts to his actions.



Objective necessity is a key concept in Spinoza's understanding of inward liberation. His ethics, notably naturalistic, propose that everything expresses conatus—the tendency to persevere in its own being—as the ultimate criterion of moral value. The sage, acting with enlightened egoism, masters life through a recognition of objective necessity. Reason teaches him to require kindness instead of hatred and gentleness rather than violence.

Every man becomes a Don Quixote driven by hopes for his creativity. However, unlike the real is for even an utterly defeated Don Quixote, reality consists not in realities but in dreamers with materialistic hopes. Freedom comes from right knowledge of one's external situation; it lies beyond virtue or passion. In Spinoza's profound vision, when intellectual love—conditioned by the categorical imperative—is realized, a truly meaningful ethics emerges.

Nature is seen as insufficient on its own. As for man who seeks wisdom, intuition based on reason views reality under the guidance of God. This opens a vision of a higher world order.



Part of eternity, to become one with the infinite mind that truly knows, is the only mode in which a man can act and participate more fully in the divine. This is the intellectual love of God by which humanity approaches immortality and contains within it the hope of blessedness, mankind's real liberty.

Knowledge of an objective necessity has developed into the intuition of an inward acceptance. Freedom for Spinoza truly resides in a mystical relationship with the Infinite, made possible through the guidance of Reason, in a resignation that brings peace and in the tranquility of perfect knowledge.

Though it would be unwise to say that Spinoza's goal was a willful resignation, he offered no obvious content to an ethical conclusion. However, Kant's categorical imperative has provided us with a rule for moral conduct: an action can only be considered morally right if it can be universalized as a law that everyone could follow.

In Spinoza's "Ethics," true understanding involves a mystical union with the Infinite, guided by Reason and marked by tranquility and peace.



Certainly! Here is a revised version:

It is necessary to consider that it was merely to Spinoza's ontological interpretation of the intellect and the concept of universal applicability based on a rational conception of a priori principles. How the nature of the transcendental experience of the moral law in Kant becomes meaningful: It reveals an underlying human capacity for objective necessity, though beyond mere phenomena, that fulfills an intuition of the unity of all existence and a sense of responsibility towards others—expressed as tolerance—in the concept of the dignity of the individual. Knowledge of objective necessity gives peace; recognition of inward necessity gives power.

Life is painting a picture, not doing sums, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said. "As twenty men of genius looking out of the same window will paint twenty canvasses each unlike all the others and every one great, so one comes to think that men may be pardoned for the defects of their qualities if they have the qualities of their defects... I learned in the regiment and in the class at least this conclusion: what I think is the best service we can do for our country and for ourselves: To see as far as possible."
