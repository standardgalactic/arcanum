According to Toynbee (op. cit., Vol. IV), civilizations merely exist in a cycle that allows for higher experiences. This vision perceives the rarity, which lies within and beyond this world—the City of God emerges from the ashes of the human city's destructions. Herein lies the concept of transfiguration, transforming worldly events into incidental appearances within a celestial drama, considering true peace as an inner state of blessedness that comes with recognizing limits. Yet, how can we know God's realm to be beyond this world and not part of it? What is the significance of God in relation to His transcendence?

Dante has poetically resolved these philosophical problems with two similes: one geometric, concerning the nature of the relationship between a square and the side of a plane of a cube, and the other geographical, based on a temporal superposition of successive layers of settlements on the same site. Neither are completely satisfactory.

The geometrical simile merely proves the feasibility of constructing such a relation, not its existence. The geographical analogy illustrates the truth that every physical structure is built upon previous ones.



The object is part of a larger whole, as discussed by Toynbee in his work "A Study of History" (Vol. VI, pp. 159-162). Toynbee raises the issue that man participates in a divine plan and, being God's creature, cannot achieve greater perfection on his own.

The conception of the first intelligence (self-evidence of certain axioms) and the affection for the first objects of desire (the pure love of God) express the divine imprint. However, Man has also fallen from Eden. He has tasted both good and evil, making him capable of both righteousness and corruption.

Man's corrupt nature is so extensive that unaided he would be totally incapable of transcending his fallen state. Humanity attains the possibility of Grace only through the majesty of Christ's sacrifice. Its existence reveals an incessant struggle for self-realization of a will corrupted by desire. Reason, "the virtue that counsels," constitutes the agency by which the will is determined into its proper direction.

The potential to love God expresses Man's true essence; the misdirection of this feeling contains the fatality of existence. Inward blessedness exhibits the reflection of God in love and that of all true believers, serving as a condition for transcending the corruption inherent in fallen humanity.



For immortality, yet this love cannot achieve the full implications of its lineage in the mundane sphere or by merely rational conditions. Only Paradise sees the complete union of Love, Desire, and Reason. Here everything ceases in the all-encompassing Love of God. This is the true meaning behind Piccarda Donati’s musings.

It must be understood that this interpretation of Dante aligns with my construction of "Paradiso" as a continuation of "Purgatorio." In the celestial sphere, the dual aspects of volition and necessity are expressed through symbolic appearances, such as in the Moon. There, Dante's retrospective query regarding the justice of degrees of bliss appears essentially meaningless.

Moreover, it is also the case that for the blessed, there exists an ability to read each other’s thoughts. In Paradise, indeed, "the virtue that counsels" has become superfluous at least in directing connotations. Knowledge is now instantaneous; belief and understanding are unified.



The passage explores Toynbee's metaphysical doctrine, critiquing its overly utilitarian approach and lack of explicit formulation. It posits that God's love is akin to a brotherhood in Christian theology, serving as the link between mundane and supra-mundane realities. This connection is symbolized by Christianity through figures like God the Father, representing immanence, and Christ, who sacrifices himself for others' blessedness.

Toynbee uses these metaphysical assumptions to impose a normative pattern on historical events. He evaluates attitudes towards life that characterize disintegrating civilizations within a Christian theological framework. For instance, Stoic philosophy's detachment is seen as violating the imperative of brotherhood based on God's love. Socrates' death thus loses meaning as it represents a futile reaction rather than a meaningful action.

Implicit moral actions in statements such as "the criminality of militarism" or "the greater treasure reaped by Jews who could not accept Christ" are explained through this lens, as their inability to embrace Christianity doomed their civilization. Toynbee's metaphysical assumptions shape his concept of cultural growth: primitive humanity represents a Yin state of integration, preceding further advancement in the divine order.

The operative minority contains saints whose souls experience the divine and inspire response, acting as "the virtue that otherwise" in Dante’s terms, toward the uninspired majority. The fall from Greece results in human nature's perversion, preventing direct illumination and necessitating recourse to a mediated utopianism dominated by material mechanisms.



Title: "The City of Destruction: A Testament to Human Potential"

In his work, Toynbee does not merely seek deeper meanings than Spengler; he situates himself within the British Empiricist tradition. He asserts that history reveals its immanence through the proper application of methodology and patient classification of data. However, this approach is inconsistent with Toynbee's philosophical basis. A mere empirical analysis of history is impossible because the regularity observed in phenomena constitutes an ontological assertion of order. An empiricist cannot find purposefulness in history, as regularity implies at least the necessity of constant conjunction. Historical "laws" deny the unique experience or creative act by reducing them to agents of inexorable processes that consistently produce new manifestations of success and power.

Success constitutes the final lesson that historical phenomena teach humanity. Each accomplished fact and each surviving political organization testify to a method of prevailing, representing an answer to the pragmatic query: "What works?" A mere call to historical data—though it can never be constructed free from the metaphysical presupposition inherent in selectivity—will always represent a negation of freedom and an assertion of determinism. The alternatives accompanying each historical path challenge our understanding of human potential and freedom.

In essence, the study of history through Toynbee's lens invites us to recognize patterns of success while acknowledging the limitations imposed by deterministic interpretations. It is a call to understand that while history may guide us, it should not constrain our creative and free expressions of humanity.



The perverted performances now forgotten leave only the deed to remain as evidence of its fatedness. Failure constitutes the only sin known in history through an empirical and pragmatic approach.

Toynbee, however, does not succeed in constructing an edifice based on empirical considerations. His conclusions are precisely what one would expect in light of his philosophical assumptions and theological convictions. A pragmatist should have been careful about a method that yields answers so obviously in line with his preconceptions.
