It has been suggested that culture and its components—individuals—are not mutually exclusive entities. Spengler would agree that all activity presupposes individual volition. The crucial question, however, is whether this personal volition represents an autonomous, inexorable Destiny that implicitly structures thought or serves as the cause of a Civilization's development.

Toynbee offers no definite answer to this question. He denies the concept of a Culture's soul but his differentiation by growth resembles the psychological debate over whether a child's personality is formed before birth or begins to develop after the first days. It seems that, after initial challenges are surmounted, subsequent problems, in Toynbee's terms, become confined within ever narrower limits.

The dilemma of necessity and freedom remains unresolved. The inadequacy of utilizing history as a technical proof of norms has become more apparent. His concept is very close to a concept of "Conclusions."

### The Breakdown of Civilizations

For Toynbee, the breakdown of civilizations can never contain the sanction of unavoidable fatality. If growth is a process of progressive realization, breakdown must result from a failure of self-determination. A challenge that does not evoke a successful response constantly faces a failing civilization with its threatening presence. Under its impact, the reactive capacity of the civilization becomes exhausted; the creative majority loses its charm for the uninspired majority.

Nemesis breaks down and society degenerates into antagonistic classes. To escape these tensions of the now dormant minority, individuals may turn to...

Toynbee views a universal state as an instrument of repression. The internal proletariat gives expression to its frustration through the creation of a universal church, which serves as the repository for the meaning of history. His metaphysical dilemma accompanies him on his journey through history. The difficulty of uniting normative concepts with empirical deduction becomes increasingly pronounced. If all civilizations have collapsed or exhibited symptoms of breakdown, how can a society's decline be consistently denied? Why is Christianity considered of absolute validity in a cosmology that produces higher religions as the accidental consequence of social breakdown? These questions dominate Toynbee’s analysis of the breakdown of civilizations.

All civilizations that have historically existed have either declined or exhibit symptoms of decay. One cannot draw conclusions from these phenomena until all possible theories have been examined. Toynbee rejects the argument that the decline of civilizations results from a general deterioration of the earth, asserting instead the relative youth of the species in terms of its lifespan.

The racial theory, which has roots since Plato and Aristotle, insists that all creative endeavor results from the infusion of vital blood into stagnant civilizations, while decline follows from the degeneration of this race. For instance, despite the Renaissance being attributed to the Lombard invasions, with their beneficial effects taking several centuries to appear, empirical data fails to support this thesis according to Toynbee. The bloom of the Risorgimento occurred without any preceding barbarian invasion.

What about the cyclic theory? Does the repetitive movement of the stars find its counterpart in human history? At first glance, Toynbee’s assumption of an elemental rhythm that expresses itself in alternate states of Yin and Yang, with Withdrawal-and-Return, lends support to this thesis. However, Toynbee denies that these constitute a correct inference. While the shuttle that leaves the web of time moves up and down, it is its movement that serves as the condition for creating meaningful patterns. The wheel must turn in order to advance. Withdrawing-and-Returning, Toynbee wavers on the question of Western civilization but generally seems reluctant to include it among the decaying societies. It appears likely he sees a racial issue at play.



The process for the liberation of the Promethean Era of creativity is not revealed by cycles but requires a specific framework. Breakdowns of civilizations do not result from cosmic forces alone, but rather from factors within human conduct. What criteria exist for evaluating decline?

Clean examines the relation of civilization to its physical and human environment. Loss of control over the physical environment does not necessarily equate to decline.

In summary, understanding the interaction between civilization and its surroundings is crucial for assessing its stability or vulnerability to decline.



The decline of a civilization is not solely due to technical malpractice across various fields, which can continue long after a society's fall. Wherever command over the physical environment exists, it exhibits its consequences rather than causes social breakdown. For instance, the ability to construct roads did not diminish after Marcus Aurelius, but Roman willingness to do so degenerated. The technical knowledge for draining swamps existed throughout Rome’s history, yet the capacity to respond to this ongoing challenge waned, leading over time to malaria-ridden campaigns.

Loss of command over the human environment also fails as a criterion for the breakdown of civilizations in Toynbee's scheme. Indeed, the early stages of decline reveal an apparent increase in the mastery of the human environment. However, this argument does not refute the necessity of a civilization’s decline. A purposeful movement within objective terms, subjectively involves the growth and decline of civilizations.

These arguments are presented at length because without some glimpse into Toynbee's methodology, his philosophy becomes meaningless.



I was born in a country that was corrupted by civilization through colonization and war, which led to large areas being destroyed. This is not just because of inherent decline; rather, barbarian incursions upon the civilization of nations bleed from their maps like parasites, creating gaps where civilizations once were. Here again are lands that now begin with civilization's end.

Similarly, Toynbee denies that the impact of an alien civilization may call a society to a breakdown. An alien civilization succeeds in making its domination effective only in the advanced stages of social breakdown. A society that has undergone a prolonged "Time of Trouble" without being able to create universal states may welcome an alien intrusion that offers relief from intolerable warfare. This was the service performed by the Ottoman Empire for the Orthodox-Christian civilization.
