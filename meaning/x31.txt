Nobody illustrates the symptoms of "ego-centric delusion" more vividly than Toynbee, who castigates it so violently. Love is not imminent in historical data but constitutes a revolt of the soul. History is not a book designed to illustrate the New Testament; nor do Christ's sayings embody truisms for "successful" conduct.

However, the superimposition of an empirical method on a theological foundation, with data conceived as proving moral validity instead of deriving from a transcendent experience, yields this result. It never becomes clear whether the Pharisees are condemned because of their failure to recognize Christ's moral superiority or because of their lack of political perspicacity in failing to respond properly.

Particularly since Toynbee refuses to accept the Marxist Theory of Material Progress because it fits with his conception of age, he swings uneasily between rejecting naturalism for its ethical deficiency or its suicidal tendencies. 

An empirical criterion does not provide a normative pattern for evaluating humanity; rather, it represents logical inconsistency. The connection between moral action and material success cannot be found in empirical analysis. This lack compelled Kant to propose the postulation of God as the guarantor of the summum bonum.

Empirical analyses value correlational judgments, but they cannot establish causality or normative directives without additional philosophical grounding.



The notion of existence, the consequence of our experience of freedom, cannot be guaranteed by the appearance of historical phenomena. Such a guarantee would reduce ethics to matters of prudence. In this view, a violator of the moral code would not be considered a knave but rather a fool. Freedom is not overthrown merely by assertions or purposes that become self-serving; it should manifest as an expression of its own historical law, observable as a sociological technique for blessing civilization.

The concepts are now available through rational observation and analysis of natural causation and the growth of societal structures. Cleaned-up language helps clarify these points without extraneous notes.



The concept of "virgin ground" in historical progression can be intriguingly explored through Toynbee's philosophy. His work distinguishes two main approaches to understanding history: the biological and the theological.

**Biological Approach:**  
Toynbee views history as an evolutionary process characterized by cycles of growth and decay, much like a living organism. He perceives civilizations as entities that undergo stages of development and decline. This cyclical view suggests that history is driven by internal dynamics where societies rise, flourish, and eventually fall due to their inability to adapt to changing circumstances.

**Theological Approach:**  
In contrast, the theological perspective interprets history as a manifestation of divine will. It posits that historical events are part of a larger plan meant to guide humanity towards certain existential truths. This approach emphasizes moral lessons derived from temporal successes and failures, suggesting that all human endeavors, except those recognizing their transient nature, ultimately fail.

**Virgin Ground:**  
The idea of "virgin ground" metaphorically represents the untouched potential within each civilization or individual soul—a space for renewal and fulfillment. It embodies hope and aspiration, urging us to look inward rather than solely relying on historical phenomena to guide our understanding.

In essence, Toynbee's philosophy encourages a dual recognition: while history may follow patterns of rise and fall (biological), it also holds deeper moral implications (theological) that can inspire personal and collective growth. This concept of "virgin ground" serves as a reminder of the continuous possibility for renewal and transformation inherent in both civilizations and individual souls.



The notion of a supra-cosmic plane of reality denies the substantiality of all worldly endeavors. This is the tendency in Toynbee's analysis of the breakdown of civilizations and their disintegration.

Toynbee as a potential source of freedom, therefore, is deceptive. The biological approach reduces Challenge-and-Response to an illusory description of the immanent Elan Vital. The theological view considers our impotence mainly as a tool to teach us about God's omnipotence on the temporal plane. This is compounded by the empirical method, which moves with great patience through an immense amount of historical data. However, determinism belongs to the past and is therefore ruled by necessity. Freedom, on the other hand, cannot be derived as an attribute of reality only through inward experience.

History as purpose represents a metaphysical assumption, not a necessary conclusion from historical events.

This becomes very noticeable in Toynbee's analysis of the phases of civilization. Challenge-and-Response, the interaction of Culture and Environment, is conceived as the key factor in a civilization's progress. However, his theory becomes meaningful only if it is connected intrinsically with the responsive capacity of reality for response. This is presumably what an empirical method cannot provide ever. Its chief concern is not the uniqueness of the response but the generality of the challenges.

Toynbee carefully classifies all possible challenges as qualitatively equivalent and varying only in intensity. However, this reduces Challenge-and-Response to a restatement of the Environment theory. These are problems raised by this phase of "The Study of History."

Toynbee's philosophy of history begins with a query: What are the smallest meaningful entities which a historian may study? An examination of England's past leads Toynbee to the conclusion that every nation belongs to a larger unit, which acts as the framework for its endeavors. Consequently, civilizations—not states—are the social units with which a philosophy of history must concern itself. For this reason too, relations between states have completely different import than contacts among civilizations. Relations between states represent the mechanisms of a society's growth. Contacts among civilizations reveal the process of apparent continuation-and-affiliation by which new civilizations rise on the ruins of the old.

Toynbee distinguishes only two completely independent civilizations throughout his study— one specimen. 

Toynbee considers the civilizations intelligible fields or studies because they are the representatives of the evolutionary rhythmic premises of existence. Here, his biological approach comes to full fruition. The dynamic activity of civilizations is but an externalized level of integration which in good time will become a phase of the Clean up the spelling mistakes and grammar.
