The theory suggests that no demon can participate in this act of creation, which involves restoring equilibrium on a new and higher plane. On the mundane level, the human protagonist consults the theater for this activity, with their ordeal unfolding over three stages. 

In the first stage, symbolized by the assault of temptation, there is a shift from Yin to Yang—from harmony to discord, from rest to motion. With awareness of the futility and inevitability of certain courses from which there is no return, begins the second stage—the crisis. The momentary rebellion at finding oneself merely a tool in God's hands transcends into peace through reconciliation. This enables man to achieve victory through defeat, peace through suffering. 

Man resigns himself into God’s hands and thus reveres the rhythm from motion towards rest, from storm to calm—from Yang back to Yin. God is revealed not as a harsh taskmaster or the cause of suffering but as all-embracing Love that makes this new level of integration possible.



Toynbee's positive factor for then is that it explains the general laws of civilization and emerging differentiation as the relation of Challenge-and-Response. Life presents a series of problems, however; each an appropriate challenge of its quantitative order to phenomena we have hitherto encountered. Men can evolve a formula for the prediction of historical events, but no one can know the outcome until the ordeal actually occurs.

Despite this analysis of the importance of response, Toynbee engages in an extensive analysis of the historically affective stimuli to determine the range of possible responses. An examination of the genesis of civilizations leads to the law that their birth results not from unusually easy conditions, but frequently in response to difficult environments.



In examining the genesis of civilizations such as those in Egypt and Sumeria, it initially appears that these related civilizations do not respond directly to their physical environments. However, upon closer reflection, it becomes evident that their response is more attuned to the social environment rather than the physical one.

The internal prototype's will to secede indicates a dominant minority's desire to repress, with the final breaking away signifying an intolerance of the challenge presented by their surroundings. Moreover, the geographical location of affiliated civilizations often presents a greater stimulus than the physical locus of the parent civilizations.

Both the physical and human environments can provide the catalyst that tends to initiate the genesis of civilizations. The intensity of the response represents a function or measure of the severity of the stimulus. Ease is crucial for civilization's development. For example, the challenges faced by hard countries led to the superiority of nations like Greece over those in the Rhineland or the triumph of New England over rivals in the colonization of North America.

Dynamic activity testifies to the direction of resources and efforts throughout history. For instance, the Yellow River basin was crucial for Chinese development just as much as the Nile was for Egypt. Similarly, European success in North America highlights this dynamic interplay between environments and civilizations.



A new entity emerged around a provoked province by the Byzantine Empire, akin to a gate of crisis within its realm. Naval tombs recount how this region, once at the center of tradition, faced challenges through blows and pressures that accounted for the upheaval among many political entities. The vibrancy of border provinces was shaped as much by their historical narrative as by external influences like Prussia post-1871, which under the impact of France and Austria-Hungary, found itself in a dominant position within its civilization—a result from enduring constant challenges as guardians at the frontiers.

The history of the growth phase of the Holy Roman Empire exhibits a continuous shift towards border regions. Its decline marked a reversal of this tendency. Whether the Ottoman or the Austrian Empire revived their rivalry for the Balkans remains uncertain, yet this illustrates distinct responses to stimuli: hard blows and counter-pressures versus new grounds and internal stirrings.

Toynbee distinguishes these reactions. An increase in the severity of stimuli yields different outcomes based on their nature.



The passage discusses Toynbee's views on historical challenges faced by civilizations and their responses. According to Toynbee, civilizations cannot indefinitely continue with successful responses without eventually facing a significant challenge—a concept he defines as the "Golden Mean." This principle suggests that there should be enough stimulation to fully realize the potential of creativity but not so much that it becomes oppressive.

Toynbee introduces the "Law of Compensation" to explain this principle. It posits that an excessive challenge faced by either the physical environment or humanity must be balanced by alleviation in the other factor. He cites Switzerland and Holland as examples, where difficult physical environments were offset by reduced human pressure.

However, applying the concept of the Golden Mean raises methodological issues, particularly in defining what constitutes an excessive challenge. An unsuccessful response to a particular challenge might indicate a lack of internal reactive ability. Toynbee offers two approaches: one involves comparing conditions under which the optimal level of civilization produces peak responses; another examines failed civilizations that collapsed upon encountering overwhelming challenges.

For instance, he references the Far Eastern Civilization of the Celtic peoples as an example of such collapse due to formidable initial challenges. For further discussion on these foundational ideas in relation to Aristotle's concepts, see Toynbee's work in Volume II, page 274.



Toynbee, in Volume I, pages 291-322, offers illustrations using a model that focuses on the challenges faced by civilizations and their responses. He suggests that Christianity in Ireland might have developed differently from Rome, as Irish missionaries spread across the continent demonstrating remarkable learning. However, the disciplined structure of the Roman Church and the impact of the Scandinavian migrations posed significant challenges to Irish Christianity. The Synod of Whitby (A.D. 664) resolved this issue but led to Ireland's isolation within Christianity.

The invasions by the Normans were not fully overcome when Henry II invaded with Papal sanction. These successive blows presented a severity that made effective recovery difficult, leading to an abortive renaissance in Western Civilization.

Toynbee’s concept of challenge-and-response characterizes historical purposes, emphasizing an imponderable creative force that prevents predicting reactions to ordeals. This involves integration levels and dynamic activity, leading to inner reconciliation with God and recognition of His love.
