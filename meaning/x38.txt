For Toynbee, growth constitutes a pattern of progressive externalization of challenge-and-response. As the external factor continually diminishes in importance, the necessity for self-articulation becomes more pronounced. Growth is a process of progressive externalization.



If increasing the range of a field-determination through the transfer of the "field of activity" from the macrocosm to the microcosm is considered, this represents an effort in historical representation. Growth exhibits either increased self-determination or another mechanism to accomplish itself. Toynbee examines two common arguments in the theory of atomic independence of individuals and the conception of society as a biological organism. He refutes the former by referencing the Odyssey's description of the Cyclops and posits that language and communication represent an area or activity.

Toynbee also discusses the dependency of this concept on Hegel, emphasizing that thought can only be developed in society. For Toynbee, society represents an aggregate of individuals, each constituting a discrete field of activity. These fields intersect to contain the political and social institutions of each civilization. A field of action cannot serve as a source of action; it merely provides common ground for the encounter of various forces. Society serves as the medium of communication for these interacting components.

Toynbee considers creativity an attribute of suddenly inspired individuals who arise with inexplicable rarity, embodying the essence of evolutionâ€”the force that changes the state of Yin into the activity of Yang. These men of genius push back the vistas of human intelligence and serve as guideposts on the road of history. Their illumination is achieved in a mystic ecstasy, transforming the essence of their souls and indicating the necessity for fresh creation. They represent the future state of Yin and an intrinsic superiority comparable to the eminence of civilizations over primitive societies.

The appearance of these "saints" or "geniuses" presents society with a dilemma: though they galvanize society into activity, the uncreative majority remains.



The trial was a lengthy affair that required a lot of preparation and collaboration among all parties involved. The reliance on digital tools was significant, facilitating various aspects of the process efficiently.

At the conclusion, actions were taken to ensure everything adhered strictly to procedure. Notably, at Tulane University School of Law, it was observed how these processes unfold in an academic setting as well. Throughout, maintaining clear and effective communication proved essential for successful outcomes.



However, at a certain level, can integration be achieved? Indeed, it is possible. I am discussing an analysis that generates existing insights into specific features so crucial for filling the social void by offering more than mere realism and everyday life rejections.

Such challenges include acquiring practical insights through thorough research on real-life needs, leading to effective measures. These measures encourage personal growth, help achieve goals, and facilitate clean-up actions. They also promote significant changes in individuals' lives, allowing them to pursue a more fulfilling existence with purposeful direction.



The direction in which an action is taken constitutes a crucial cut fraught with danger for the mechanicalness that might be channeled into brutal directions. Yet, it reveals the only condition for social growth; it risks the problem of mortality.

The Saint cannot achieve his mystic ecstasy in society. Only in solitude can he attain it through suffering that inspires those who share his vision to rise above their weaknesses and enter a state of enlightenment promised by the Primordial promise. This process enables them to clean up their spiritual paths, paving the way for social advancement while embracing the inherent risks involved.



He was determined to lead his people. The story unfolds with a young individual who grew into greatness, renowned for his remarkable abilities. He was known for his strength and leadership.

The tale is about the birth of the agricultural god, Christ's sojourn in the wilderness. The intuition that withdrawal obtains its moral sanction becomes apparent as he seeks clarity and purpose away from society. This period of solitude helps him understand the true essence of moral values.



The transformation of the microcosm must manifest itself in the macrocosm. The Greek philosophers considered withdrawal as the ultimate state of bliss. Plato's captives return to the cave with a heavy heart. Christianity, on the other hand, sees the value in the ordeal and the quality of the return; it will lead the captives towards the light.

Here, Tuynbee's mythology of the genesis of civilizations recurs. It is the crisis state of a civilization whose balance and stability are disturbed.



In the inner council, I enable the macrocosm to participate in creating its own reality. Growth exhibits a return on investment that represents these universal pulses through rhythm and harmony. This results in peace from activity, reconciliation from suffering, and harmony from discord.

This is the meaning for Toynbee of the lives of Dante, Hildegard, Saint Paul, and Buddha.
