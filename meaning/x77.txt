This essay aims to explore the sense of responsibility within a determined system. I seek to understand how humans set norms for themselves and find meaning amidst inevitable events through categorical imperatives that reconcile conflicts, promoting lasting peace in line with human aspirations. Kant's philosophy integrates knowledge and belief, elevating humanity beyond deterministic phenomena into a relationship with a supersensuous world order.

Kant sought to extend his historical philosophy as a guarantee of attaining moral law, yet this was unsuccessful due to the lack of reconciliation between freedom and necessity through external experiences alone. The mechanism of nature offers no clear assurance for implementing freedom, highlighting the challenge in aligning ethical actions with organic necessity.

Nonetheless, Kant's ideas emphasize the coexistence of experience with knowledge of both necessity and freedom. This transcendental perspective challenges mechanistic views, suggesting that our perceived limitedness provides norms to overcome necessity through purposeful striving. However, unresolved questions remain regarding the relationship between subjective experiences and universal purposes.

The following chapter will attempt to address these issues by exploring the sense of responsibility in a cosmological context.



When viewed retrospectively, history evokes a dual feeling of inevitability coupled with an immeasurable doubt. The sense of inevitability arises from contemplating completed actions, apprehending the facts of occurrence, and unraveling the veritable sequence into which the mind orders events. We can never be certain that another development was possible or that strict inevitability did not escape all endeavors. This doubt is a token of rebellion against such a view, an assertion of individuality, or a demand by the soul for its freedom.

Every concept about the necessity of events at the moment of their performance offers no guide to action. Spengler believed he could derive from it maxims of effective conduct, yet his analysis failed as a postulate of action because necessity constitutes an attribute of external reality. It classifies the past, but man lives in the future. The causality Toynbee understood as a purposive element, but did not admit to its attainability.

Re sought to wrest from historical events assurance of permanence and a pledge of physical salvation. But life does not exhibit this certainty. Phenomena may always appear inevitable at the moment of perception; they already form part of the past. Purpose, insofar as it is an attribute of the soul or vision that man imagined would surround him, conditions motivation. Man experiences himself as an equation of freedom.

Life is an inward state, transcending external appearances and realities. Activity, desires, dreams which make life possible are expressions of this inner freedom.



Categorical imperative entails a vision that lifts man to an order beyond empirical reality. A mystical relationship with the Infinite provides the foundation for motivated activity, to which the phenomenal world can offer no permanent obstacles. The basis, Kant's idea in "Idea for a Universal History" demands from the realm of necessity gifts of the realm of freedom. This inconsistency is subsumed in the transcendent experience of the moral law, which alone suffices to validate all historical striving.

What is the nature of this experience? It does not derive from the phenomenal world, for that knows only necessity. It is not produced by rational reflection, for it provides the condition for determining the will by reason. It must constitute a mystical attitude then, an inward state that feels the cosmos in the universe.

There are moments in every person's life when even tensions fall away and the unity of all creation appears as a sudden vision. These are the occasions when time stands still and man partakes of eternity. This is akin to Spinoza’s intellectual love of God—the total apprehension or the divine immanence, the resignation that gives peace, the bliss that elevates man above himself.

This was what the Greeks considered to be the good, the divine in action, the beautiful as an intuition and a quality; it was regarded by them as the ultimate form of beauty. This is akin to an intuitive understanding of unity and totality, as the ancients recognized beauty not just as a sensory experience but as an expression of deeper truths that connect us with the cosmos itself.



In ultimate contemplation, man is free through the recognition of necessity that enables him to transcend his determined level of stability and environment. But how can a recognition of necessity imply freedom? If this were true, why not multiply restrictive measures to increase liberty? The objections here miss the objective necessity of the phenomenal world for the inward necessity or recognition of limits. 

The sanctity we give to the necessity felt as a reality transcending our existence—the meaning ascribed to our particular life (which also sets limits)—testifies to a personality, to the uniqueness each man imparts to the inevitable. This is ethical freedom, which reveals reverence for the soul and exhibits a realization that one is human and not divine.

From the feeling of reverence stems tolerance, respect for the dignity of the individual, and the apprehensions that set boundaries on one's endeavors.

Schwaller believed that the will-to-live provided the basis for this inward liberation. However, he was mistaken. The will-to-life merely wishes to prevail. It may derive maxims of prudence for self-preservation at best. But ethical survival activity does not derive its maxima from the struggle for survival itself. It reveals an inner state that conditions the self-assertiveness of the will by recognition of a higher reality which contains the sanction of all endeavor.

Life is suffering, birth involves death. Transitoriness is the fate of existence. No civilization has yet achieved permanence in history, highlighting the dilemma of mortality. However, Spengler's assertion that life exhausts its meaning with appearances denies the transcedental fact of existence. We know we must die and yet live with a mode of permanence. Despite how determined our actions are by our convictions, consciousness conspires against this appearance, aspiring to something more enduring.



In exploring the inner workings of form, we encounter results that were not consciously intended—unexpected successes and failures that seem undeserved. This necessitates setting limits to one's actions and fosters a feeling of reverence. Instead of claiming hopes as patterns of reality, this reverence becomes the foundation of morality. This is not merely a necessity of thought but rather a condition of experience, not merely utilizing nature’s mechanisms but finding means for its transcendence.

This leads us to our second question: What is the relation of history to man's experience of morality? What does the transitoriness of historical existence mean in the face of man’s possibility for self-transcendence?

If moral action derives its maxims from phenomenal reality, one might expect history to disclose some increase in mastery over human existential problems. If virtue were merely right knowledge of an objective, naturalistic necessity, then the past should reveal progress toward universally recognized ethics. Moreover, if the cause of nature parallels aspirations, then all hope of the past becomes a cruel joke, reducing history to “a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.” It would be akin to cleaning up ancient oracles written on leaves that the wind shatters, which depart without counsel and hate the sibyl.
