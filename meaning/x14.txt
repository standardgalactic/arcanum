The primary essence of a moving soul is to empirically understand the world as a condition for survival. However, technical knowledge alone does not suffice. Beyond mere technique and environment, humans intuit the presence of "something other" in themselves and others. This something, with its physiognomically impressive powers, evokes both the desire to know and anxious curiosity about everything.

Man perceives this deeper reality within the cosmos—a world beyond just nature and technology. It's a profound awareness that drives our quest for understanding and connection with what lies beneath the surface of observable phenomena. This perception is not merely intellectual but deeply emotional, urging us to engage with the mysteries of existence and meaning.



The text delves into a philosophical exploration contrasting Time with Space, suggesting that just as Time serves as a counterpoint to Space, the notion of a soul is an inverse reflection of the world's picture. This idea aligns with Spengler’s metaphysical framework, where the soul's representation holds religious and spiritual significance yet becomes subject to critical analysis when observed through a scientific lens.

The passage also touches on how every psychology can be viewed as counter-physics, implying that psychological understanding limits an exact science of the universe due to its depth experience within cultural contexts. For instance, Apollinian culture constructed its inner world from excellent parts, illustrating how Western thinkers conceptualize their perceptions and ideas.

This text suggests a complex interplay between metaphysical beliefs, cultural constructs, and scientific inquiry, emphasizing that spiritual and psychological dimensions challenge objective analysis of the universe.



The Magian psychologist views his soul as an airy substance (nephesh, ruach) in conjunction with a bodily substance; both derive reality only from an infusion of the divine pneuma. Spengler defines the image of the soul as the possible, and the world as the actual. Thus, life is the process of actualizing the possible, and the history of each culture constitutes a ripening and deepening of its soul-picture. This accounts for the profound symbolism of all manifestations of activity in Culture, and the complete lack of inner meaning of every creation of both primitive and civilized states.

Since working-consciousness achieves self-knowledge through the experience and fear of death, the rites of burial serve as profound indications of the depth-experience of different cultures. Because all art is an expression of world-longing and all natural science an analysis of the religious world-picture, the grand emblem of culture includes their manifestations with the provision that maturity and decline will see a diminution of the cosmic beat, its emanations becoming more uncertain and inconclusive until the inevitable approach of the fallah state.

The Classical or Apollinian soul conceived of existence as exhausting itself in a pure present against the background of the Golden Age. Its passionate denial of infinity came to expression at its inception with the great refusal to take over the form-world and architectural style of the Minoan world, around 1100 B.C., when Mycenaean culture emerged. The barrow for the burial of the dead was supplanted by the burning of the corpses; wood replaced stone as a building material despite an abundance of quarries in Greece. Existence consisted of a denial of infinity and an emphasis on pure being.

Thucydides notes that before the year 400 B.C., not much of importance had happened in Greece. Life, in the Apollinian world, constituted a spiritual state. The Greek word for personality, "persona," does not express the concept of character but describes the public guise or its carrier. The ideal of the Classical was Cosmos, the perfectly defined absolute Entity, in opposition to which space was relative—not as a challenge but as Non-Entity. Chaos, the not-yet-formed.

The self-asserting ego of the Eastern culture, or its forceful, all-pervasive God, would have been equally alien to the Apollinian world feeling. Man achieves reality through his relation to other bodies, with the Gods as the upper limit and the slave as the lower. This explains Aristotle's statement that only a fool of a god could live alone and makes the idea of an Athenian Robinson Crusoe unthinkable. The Gods were merely perfectly formed bodies of more than average powers, though equally subject to other bodies to the blind workings of Tyche. Zeus in the Iliad holds up the aegis, not to determine but to learn Hector's fate.

The Platonic conception of the soul as a sum of excellent parts, with Reason in the Olympian commanding position, emerges just as its yearning for concreteness constructed a scientific theory of static mechanics.



The problem concerning the relationship between the knower and the known is often addressed as a straightforward transition in the passage of knowledge to the recipient. The prisoners in Plato's Allegory of the Cave were truly captives, objects illuminated by common light, rather than, as Immanuel Kant suggested, imposing their forms on the world or radiating the universe themselves.

The essence of Attic drama centered around pivotal moments where its heroes, representing Euridician bodies, faced challenges not of their choosing—confronted by fate's blind forces, divine jealousy, and the profound experience of being negated. While Heracles' transformations resulted from meaningful inner development, Oedipus became a victim of circumstances that could befall anyone. The grand gesture, defining a being in relation to other bodies, represents the only possible outcome for an entity being destroyed gratuitously. Spiritual characterization was hindered by masks and padded figures, limiting movement almost entirely.

Classical architecture constantly countered the static nature inherent in building, which implied permanence. This led to the Classical temple's form of extreme poverty, as the recognition of many styles would have suggested a type of infinity. Its columns with even spacing, emphasis on beam and load, and flat roof all denied space while affirming the exclusive validity of the present. Appollinian art thus evolved into creations marked by great delicacy in characterization but also timeless evenness.

Since natural science is an outward expression of the soul-image or a religious view, it resulted in static methods. The human tendency to simplify nature's portrayal into minimal forms suitable for intellectual manipulation led to an atomistic theory—comprising small, perfectly elastic bodies with unpredictable motion through push and pull. Motion became not a spatial force but an attribute of bodies. Consequently, the greatest creation of the Classical scientific mind was Euclidean geometry: the measurement and circumscription of concrete representations.

This also applied to Classical political life. The feudal kingdoms of the Homeric period continually contracted until reaching the polis—a pure point of being where the Greek world converged.



Acropolis among other bodies could view his conception of a political organization as a self-contained state, which made everything beyond its horizons strange and potentially hostile. This led to the struggle for sheer extinction that characterized the politics of classical city-states like Athens. The only way these campaigns could be effective was through hostility towards or extermination of rival polities.

The ideal of each polis lay in autarchic complete economic independence, minimal intercourse with other city-states, a state of blissful present being—the utopia described by Plato and Aristotle for all Greek states. This anti-historical intent expressed itself in the complete depletion of national resources. The prudent, long-term policies common to Western cultures were completely unknown.

When surpluses were achieved, they were distributed among the population. In Rome, what was merely a city became immense, dotting the Mediterranean with dependencies and always focusing its attention on embodying regional existence in a central point. This Rome knew Alexandria but not Egypt. Even after citizenship was granted to all Italians, the center and meaning of events remained Rome. The idea of transferring the vote from Roman estates to state representatives never occurred.

Spengler's conception of the classical soul reveals insights into the political dynamics of these city-states.
