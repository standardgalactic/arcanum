On the other hand, does a statement about square circles posit their reality? Traditional logic would reject this based on Humean principles that although one can imagine non-square and circle shapes, a square circle cannot be logically constructed without resulting in a false judgment. However, since existence is posited to be implied by judgments rather than a requisite for them, this does not provide a reply. Russell attempted to resolve the problem by classifying objections like square circles as logical constructions that do not correspond to real entities.

In summary, within the system of reality discussed, the existence and nature of concepts are tied to their logical coherence and ability to be conceived without contradiction.



The existence theory of propositions expresses their implications concerning logic. Its structures try to present a priori and determine the nature of the analysis. It recognizes meaning as subjective implication, and reality as an emanation or an aspect expressed in the conviction of truth. Yet, it proved too great a demand on subsequent claims to provide a firmer metaphysical basis without offering objective criteria for measuring. 

## Predictive Logic

L.S. Stebbing sought to resolve the meta-physical difficulties of traditional logic. She denied the necessity of the subject-predicate-term relation, emphasizing instead that other relations between its terms than 'this paper is white' and 'snow is white', at attempt to achieve uniformity can only distinguish the meaning or the proposition.



The traditional theory of judgment is completely abandoned by Stebbing. To begin with, judgment implies truth-value but merely expresses the subjective relation of an individual to a proposition. Since the copula "is" plays no essential role, a separation from the verb of existence cannot be made. Moreover, the existence-theory of propositions results in false judgments. From this, it is inferred that if one infers the existence of lions from the statement "I think of lions," one could mistakenly assume that similar formal structures imply identical logical constructions.

In the first statement, the property of being thought-of is attributed to the lion itself, as if it were an inherent property like a lion's roar. In contrast, in the second statement, related attributes are expressed, and 'being thought-of' is not really a property at all. Thus, a bush cannot think of a lion being hunted; this misinterpretation arises from assuming that similar formal structures imply identical logical constructions.



**On the Logic of Propositions and Existence**

The concept of logical propositions involves an intricate relationship between a subject and its predicate, suggesting that every proposition is based on this subjective relation. However, the existence of such relations does not necessarily imply the existence of their subjects or predicates. This idea poses interesting challenges.

Consider the scenario where a proposition addresses a subject that is not evidently non-existent (like "things-in-themselves"). If a relationship can be attributed to these entities, does the proposition then inherently imply their existence? According to Stebbing, this question would need an affirmative answer. Yet, the most prudent conclusion from Stebbing's analysis is that propositions do not necessarily imply existence—a notion sufficient for theories like those proposed by Joseph and Bradley.

This approach challenges the philosophical assumptions underlying propositional logic, albeit at the cost of undermining the psychological attributes associated with the speaker. Essentially, if a statement merely expresses an idea without affirming the existence of its subject or predicate, it shifts how we interpret the role and meaning of language in logical discourse.



If we shift our focus from physical to metaphysical aspects, then the meaning of a judgment is simply shifted to its formulaic form. The more important aspect of Stebbing's work is the concept of descriptions derived from Frege, which constitutes a further step in understanding Meinongian consequences within metaphysical and psychological context. This illustrates that phrases such as "a square circle" can be used significantly even if they apply to no existing thing. This becomes apparent in pre-assertional logic.

According to Stebbing (op. cit., p. 138–142), the analysis of propositions to which such phrases apply is essential, whether or not they describe something real. Two examples will illustrate this:

1. The proposition "Scott is the author of 'Waverley'" can be analyzed into three assertions:
   - At least one man wrote Waverley.
   - No more than one man wrote Waverley.
   - That man is Scott.

   This proposition will be false if:
   - (1) No one had written Waverley.
   - (2) More than one person had written Waverley.
   - (3) One person had written Waverley but it wasn't Scott.

The second statement concerns what in Russell's original view would be called a "logical construction": 
"The man in the moon."

This can be broken down as:
1. There is at least one man in the moon.
2. There is only one man in the moon.
