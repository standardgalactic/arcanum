and more as a tool under human control.



A longing for divine compassion leads us to ponder the humanity of God, whose love is so great that He sacrificed His Son to offer blessedness to humanity. Salvation can only be attained through suffering; thus, a Saviour-God must experience the depths of human agony. This represents the symbol of Heraclitus and Prometheus. Orpheus appeals to Apollo as the final criterion of Love, just as Attis does for Cybele.

Among all these gods, Christ alone meets this test. His death was suffered on behalf of humanity, embodying the ultimate merit of the sacrifice made in the spirit it was endured. Of all the incarnate deities, only Christ achieves this ideal.



Toynbee engages in a prolonged critical examination of modern approaches to the question. For an accurate selection, refer to the original source for further details.



When considering these questions, one should be led not by resignation or sadness but reveal that transcendence ever abides in belief eternal love with Him which should be God's lot to love people rich this world. But who would have said the same last thing whose whole being is only last hope or mankind—the true purpose of history and the condition of eternal life.

The member of the disintegrating society, most has taken this road, has a certain hope and therefore deserves deep sorrow for their loss.



Happiness is more than mere growth; it lies in recognizing a saving truth from the Most High: He did not make one world, but two. The human wayfarer who still finds himself a sojourner in this World is not beyond the pale of the Other World, but is traveling all the time within the Kingdom of God and is free to live as a citizen of that omnipresent commonwealth both here and now, if he is willing with all his heart to pledge allegiance to Christ the King and take upon himself fully their obligations.



Zens, n.  
The hip which Christ has consecrated as his entry into the Kingdom is a discovery and birth, that is for those who seek to comprehend this citizen's identity. It is akin to finding a great treasure hidden in a field or discovering one pearl of great price.

Arnold Toynbee's journey through history ends with a paean of celebration. The theological foundation of his philosophy asserts itself in full clarity: the defeated soul of a disintegrating civilization seeks redemption. This rejection of this world is hope for salvation.



Civilization has exhausted all alternatives for healing itself, but truth emerges that true knowledge with God comes through understanding the attainment of wisdom in God, this is of worldly infinite beauty, both temporal and eternal recognition. This record of an emanation of God's love is apprehension and comprehension of the supra-mundane subsistence.



Dante's influence is clear in this text. With transfiguration, the pilgrim reaches Paradise. His mind unites with Divine Love, and terrestrial bonds fall away. Here, everything stands still; time and space no longer obstruct. The greater truth appears to man—the insignificance of mundane affairs and the transcendent reprieve which God grants to those who repent.

A method which recognizes noble qualities is marred by mysteries and impulses that detract from its essence.



Seth's essay explores the causal ways of human behavior across all its manifestations. The alternation between feeling and thought is considered metaphysical emanations from an ontological viewpoint, a perspective not supported through Christ. 

There exists a vast amount of empirical data that does not necessarily lead to disintegration. Jesus' moral "Battle of the Gods" is derived from his decision to sacrifice himself; however, this represents a value rather than a necessary conclusion from his teachings. Even such incommensurables as Hitler's abolition of the old system and Peter’s shearing of beards, or Japan's actions, are symptoms of a suicidal routine. Nothing illustrates better the frustration of empirical data reduction than that which must confine itself to mere phenomenal appearance reflecting noumena, the soul.

The assertion of purposiveness in the first phase disappeared. Can this world really be saved? For only through the disintegration of civilizations does man learn to know God.
