Spengler dates the his tory of the WBstern culture from 
fae years 900-1000. At tla t t;ime , the f'ear or the end of' the 
world , the c onfueed yearning of the V.erovingian and Carcllngian 
period , the dark groping of' the migrations suddenly c oalesced 
and tba Wes t ern a oul appeared , 1ta ess ence a s triv ing into the
irSini te, a passionate driv e to overcame all limit, to 1oae 
itself ln the que st fo:r th� e ternal. I t s repres entative for 
�ngler ls the Paus tian man , an integer of forc e , will and · 
action-at-a-dis tanc e, a lonely ego . in an endless void , reel￾ing t ime as , an e�resalon of' direo tedne ss , proj ecting his 
determination into all his ac tivities . In almos t every reapeot 
thi s emerging culture repre s en ts the polar opposite o:f the 
Appollinian . 'llle Greek Gcls dwell on Olympus ,· "but Valhalla 
ia nowhere � a eya t!c res ting place, wi th !ta d1aharmoni oue God� 
and heroes the very ay.mbol o:f s.ol1 tude ."
