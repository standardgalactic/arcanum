Complete tense as the predicate of a code that implies all the determining aspects, cryptives, and theorems belonging to the subject matter with absolute necessity. Analyzing specific portions of a system is even more desirable than focusing on consistency, which is one of the essential properties of a code. Inconsistency prevents any deduction, so construction of any system must address both consistency and an opposite discussion of this notion in relation to the pre-code.

Thus, though the hypothesis contains assumed relations and determines the code by their implication, criteria for evaluation exist only in terms of internal consistency. Yet this consistency does not indicate absolute validity. The scope of the axioms can only be revealed by the range of the theorems, and reliance on consistency gives us nothing about the adequacy of the philosophical assumptions.

In 1904, Oswald Veblen developed codes for geometry utilizing only the notion of a point and its relation to another. In 1911, Veblen conceived another code adding the notion of curvature as well. He divided his second code into two sections based on code prescriptions dealing with certain subject matters like assumptions of order among points on a line.

In 1913, Huntington elaborated a code using the notions of space and their relation within an inclusion framework. Although this resulted in great complexity of codes and cryptives, it was logically simpler than Veblen's due to the dyadic rather than triadic relations between elements compared to the latter.

Several examples from Veblen's first code will be presented to illustrate the nature of a curve as a criterion used to serve as an extension unique to the discussion of the generalized notion of topology II. If points A, B, and C are in the order (A, B, C), they are not in the order (B, C, A). Therefore, ABC implies not between BCA.

Veblen's assumptions thus consist of two elements: the geometric ones represented by terms such as point, between, and line.



The act of cognition is independent of the notation of points and between which a region only arises in such a situation in a concrete system of the topological sort, as applied to this Young function based on Newton's method. Modern Veblen continued this themeatics.

It procures at a high level calculation of the notion of code derived from the concept as a dynamic, quantified, and complex category. Since the notions of point and body between only through application to certain cases create the scriptive excess of the purely logical space. This recent transition is called the pre-code.

What critique does it offer? Two considerations are crucial for this discussion.

First, an insistence on legal consistency to each concept in its formation implies that a concentration on legality may hinder adaptation and flexibility. In a concrete pre-code instance instantiated by empirical codes (an instructive descriptive about the existence of a 500-year-old man would withstand both), it would tell nothing about criteria. Yet, no absolute standard for consistency exists. To propose consistency, concepts utilized are in turn assumed consistent. An aspect for consistency, with these reserves taken into account, would be the deduction of the pre-code.

Second, cognition necessitates abstraction and generalization from empirical data to form conceptual frameworks. This process involves a balance between maintaining enough structure to ensure coherent understanding while allowing flexibility for novel interpretations and applications. Therefore, any system claiming absolute consistency without room for evolution or adaptation risks obsolescence in dynamic contexts.



A mere general test of consistency is the instantiation of the pre-code. The free possibilities of interpretation—logical, mathematical, metaphysical, etc.—exist. If a pre-code is instantiated by a code in fluid geometry and we learn that classical geometry is consistent, we have proof for the consistency of the pre-code.

An example is provided by "this" as a Principia Mathematica logic code. In an empirical system, the element of simply passing the burden of proof to a higher order of logic or another set of assumptions involves the following epistemological axioms:

1. The empirical world is consistent.
2. Therefore this part of the physical world is consistent.
3. And our propositions about this part are true.
4. Therefore, the code regarding this part is true.
5. Therefore, the logical portion of the pre-code is consistent.

Thus, the test of the system is internal consistency, which leaves the scope of the metaphysical assumptions unanalyzed. This raises the question of the use of a pre-code. By generalizing the notion of a code, the possibility of instantiation in any manner or different sciences is given. The realization that two different sciences have the same logical structure (utilizing the axis pre-code) is preliminary to translating one science into another. This essentially follows the procedure used by Descartes in transforming algebra into geometry.

The theory of systems contains an examination of a certain unity. Unity is no longer given by self-evident propositions, but by studying all implications and deriving criteria. Yet, this unity allows for variability of metaphysical assumptions and multiplicity or validity of criteria. Its only necessary postulate is internal consistency, which in turn recognizes its epistemological limitations. Meaning is recognized as a humanization of a philosophical point of view.

This approach applies to philosophy and history. Historical data by itself is neutral; its significance constitutes a function of the resolve of a scholar. This does not imply that all metaphysical constructions are equivalent, nor that an unbiased choice exists in the selection of hypotheses or that historical data may be ignored. A hypothesis must always be in terms of some data and its relevance to this framework.



The philosophy of history seeks to explain events, aiming for more profound approaches as they broaden in scope. Events themselves testify only to occurrences; phenomenal appearances contain no moral connotation and can be apprehended solely as a category of necessity. Their inner meaning must always rely on physical causation.

For example, consider the role of Newton or codes—these derive their validity from an overarching purpose or meaning that is not immediately apparent in isolated events. Progress and its purposes are not attributes of reality but reveal inward experiences.

Gibbon thought that Rome's collapse was a triumph of barbarian force over Roman civilization. Yet, Toynbee considered the Peloponnesian War the beginning of Hellenic decline and degeneration. Similarly, what caused Hitler's downfall? Was it the invasion of Russia, the declaration of war in 1939, the seizure of Prague, or the Anschluss? Or perhaps was the fact of collapse inherent in a personality to whom the recognition of limits constituted an admission of defeat?
