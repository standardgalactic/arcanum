On May 1st, one might intend to feel the great forces beneath every detail—for that makes all the difference between philosophy and gossip, between great action and small. The least wavelet of the Atlantic Ocean is mightier than one of Buzzard's Bay—so as to hammer out a compact piece of work as well-crafted and first-rate as possible, leaving it unadvertised.

Does this mean that all attitudes are equivalent and no absolute standard of morality exists? Is man doomed to struggle without certainty and live void of assurance? In a sense, that is so. Man cannot achieve a "quarrel" or his conduct. No technical solutions to the dilemmas of life are at hand. That is the fate of existence. But it also poses a challenge with meaning for one's life.

Ethics must reside in an inward stance, in a person’s recognition of limits. Reason cannot guide the soul to knowledge of objective necessity as Spinoza demonstrated. Rational principles, such as Kant's categorical imperative, may give effect to a transcendent experience. But ultimate liberation derives from within us through an experience that is both personal and essentially incommunicable.

Philosophy may describe the nature of ethical conduct but cannot enforce its acceptance. The sanction for our actions must constitute a necessity for our souls, not merely of our thought, as Schwei tzer implies.

But if morality issues from mystical relationship, how can one reconcile this with a concept of tolerance? If our transcendent experience is in some sense absolute, must we not assert it against all who disagree with its elements of strength?

To be sure, the reconciliation or an ultimate, but personal, vision with universal applicability does not constitute the problem of ethics. Moral conduct reveals not merely the will to live, but a will that has been conditioned by a reality transcending man. Freedom derives not merely from an inward state but from an experience that conveys the recognition of limits.

This acceptance is tolerance—the knowledge that one must set boundaries for oneself and strive within them, which will lead to the positive infusion in the individual. 

Tolerance is achieved in two stages: objective necessity faces a subjective understanding.



The man's unpredictability, even with his physical weaknesses, leads to a technical system of rules such as prudence, exemplified by Hobbes' "Leviathan" and the laws of Nature. These reveal the impotence of self-assertiveness, making harmony a limiting condition and tolerance a maxim for self-preservation. Hard necessity transcends this mere evaluation of empirical relations. It leads to the bliss of Spinoza or Donne, going beyond mere resignation to become an active principle in life's challenges.



The categorical imperative of Kant is not merely based on an understanding of fallibility, nor solely on the physical necessity of mutual support; it is founded on a vision of man as an end in himself. The ultimate (which a religious soul may call divine) view which appears to his surroundings as something unconditional, originating in phenomena inherent, transcends potentialities and elevates all men above transience.

This leads to the experience of the dignity of man, by feeling inwardly reverent and preeminent over phenomena. It inspires an understanding of humanity that goes beyond mere existence, recognizing each individual's intrinsic worth.



The connection between Schopenhauer's philosophy of "inscrutable necessity" and our understanding of history is profound. We perceive the past only through phenomena, including our own actions in retrospect, which accompany their inner experiences. The past provides a framework that must be transcended by our present awareness.

In this context, recognition occurs in two stages: initially perceiving the past as governed by necessity and then experiencing freedom from it. This duality is evident in the philosophy of history. Spengler poignantly described history's objective necessity, yet we also experience freedom when considering the future. The past may be ruled by necessity, but our present moment carries an inherent freedom.

This perspective cannot be empirically proven; it arises as an attitude found within ourselves. It must be understood that while this concept suggests a fundamental difference between ideologies, such as existential freedom versus deterministic views of history, these differences are subjective and can vary widely among individuals.



One cannot quarrel with a system, such as that proposed by Hobbes in his *Leviathan*, which derives from an evaluation of the requirements for survival. However, one can bridge the gap between attitudes and their implementation. The implementation of experience is a technical problem and therefore arguable, but the experience itself is personal and incommunicable.

If a person has no transcendental experience of freedom—for example, discussions about democracy become self-discussion or debates about the efficiency of economic systems revolve around objective necessity and thereby debatable. The inward intuition of freedom, on the other hand, would reject totalitarianism even if it were economically more efficient.

For this reason, arguments suggesting that international conferences with Russia can magically resolve all differences seem fallacious. If conditions are ripe, they may achieve an understanding based on objective necessity, which, as any evaluation, may be overturned by subsequent analysis. Permanent understanding based on inward reconciliation requires more than conferences alone when the differences are more than just misunderstandings.



It seems that Kant has opened vistas for a resolution beyond mere occurrence, offering hope beyond the uncertainties of success. Peace and freedom in Kant reveal the state of a soul—a duty perhaps difficult but also of great responsibility.

What about the dichotomy our brief examination of literature indicates? Life involves suffering and transformation. No person can choose their age or the condition of their time. The past may rob the present of much joy and most mystery. The generation of Buchenwald and the Siberian labor camps cannot speak with the same optimism as its fathers. The bliss of Dante has been lost in our civilization. But this describes merely a fact of decline, not its necessity.
