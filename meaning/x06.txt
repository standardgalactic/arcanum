Everything is determined, according to the devi1te Johann Kramers (and humanity is settled forever). But due to men's inveterate stubbornness, this cannot come about for at least a thousand years. Everyone who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately order their life as they please, based on new principles. In that sense, all things are lawful for him. Moreover, even if this period never comes to pass—and there is no God or immortality—the new man might well become the man-god.

This discourse reveals the true implication of Spengler's position. The dilemma he presents is expressed in the striking phrase: "In the world of history, Rome caused the Galilean to be crucified—that was its Destiny. In another world (of Causality and morality), Rome was cast for perdition and the Cross became the pledge of Redemption—this was the Will of God." Yet, the Cross on the hills of Jerusalem has long disappeared, the temple is in ruins, and the Roman legions are not even a memory. But on roadsides all over the world, in the souls of whole civilizations, the Cross still stands. If this death and that Cross were all implied by destiny then, what does it mean?

The only analysis that holds true is if one interprets Spengler as a philosophy embodying norms of activity; though usual analyses interpret him differently. His poetic intuition became fascinated by the mere empirical analysis of power-phenomena. His approach through intuitive perception reveals no more than the empirical analysis of Toynbee.

The narrow confinement to the specific natures of each Culture seems arbitrary. There is meaning not only in the aspirations and symbols long dead but also in those that have been continued as the matrix for other civilizations. Though Spengler might argue otherwise, it's clear there is a broader significance beyond his framework.



In its original conception, Toynbee sought to address the impact that adopting an alien form must necessarily exert on its user, beyond mere adoption. While Spengler's insights are challenging and perhaps prescient, they do not fully capture the meaning of history.

Toynbee pursued a deeper understanding by seeking empirical verification in history rather than relying solely on theoretical acceptance, as was almost completely the case with Spengler. He attempted to solve one particular problem that Spengler never addressed: what causes the emergence of culture from formless humanity or the genesis of original culture.

Toynbee finds the answer in the doctrine of challenge and response. Life presents a series of problems, each posing a challenge to undergo change. The initial reaction constitutes the civilization's birth. Its course is not determined by an organic necessity but rather through responses to novel challenges. Each solution does not lead to equilibrium but creates overabundance, which becomes a new challenge. Progress occurs when societies fail to react to new stimuli.

A civilization grows through the leadership of a creative minority that directs raw material, providing social direction in the absence of direct inspiration. However, in every civilization, mimesis eventually breaks down, and an active originative minority assumes dominance, substituting force for charm. The progressive differentiation of a civilization into competing minorities and an internal proletariat, which is integral but not entirely part of a given society, occurs while creativity and meaning are invested in other-worldly pursuits—culminating in a transcendent knowledge of the unity of mankind through a universal church.

Through this net of faith, the internal proletariat rescues the values of the collapsing society, embodying them in the new civilization erected by a vigorous external proletariat on the ruins of the old. The decay of civilizations manifests outwardly as a universal state, within which the internal schism occurs. This is followed by a period of contending states and a final apocalyptic emergence of a higher religion as the embodiment of the meaning of history.

Toynbee's theory of Challenge and Response shares similarities with Hegel's dialectic; it does not negate determinism but rather describes its operation. The dynamics of response are almost exclusively in terms of challenges, lending to a refinement of Environmental Theory. Since Toynbee attempts to verify theological assumptions by empirical methods, success becomes paramount in his analysis.



The criterion of moral flight is survival. The historical purpose is identical with man's aspirations. 

The unsatisfactory conclusions of Toynbee's philosophy derive from his method. Although his conclusions provide an intuition of transcendent experience, they lack empirical support. His attempt to find a causal realization of a divine purpose in political power results in inconsistencies, such as the assertion that the act of Christi-anity will save the West, despite the collapse of every other civilization and the fact that in Toynbee's scheme, universal churches appear as concomitants of disintegration.

An arbitrary experience cannot be proven by empirical data. A philosophy of history without a profound metaphysics will forever juxtapose surface data and can never satisfy the totality of man's desire for meaning.

Spengler had a vision but did not press its implications. Yet his intuition of History-as-experience has pointed the way to solving the enigma posed by the experience of freedom and the knowledge of necessity. He realized that the phenomenal world is explored in vain for proof of those ideas, "the possibilities of" which no human intelligence will overcome, but whose truth no sophistry can wrest from the conviction of even the commonest man. An analysis of historical phenomena reveals only the inevitability inherent in completed action.

Freedom, on the other hand, testifies to an act of self-transcendence which overcomes the inexorability of events by infusing them with its spirituality. The ultimate meaning of history is found within ourselves. 

What is the content of this transcendental experience? It is not easy to express. When Socrates in "The Republic" is asked to explain the "Idea of the Good," he replies that it cannot be defined. Men attain its vision only by analogy, by studying those objects which contain some portion of ultimate reality, such as beauty, truth, mathematics. This reflection may lead to a sudden illumination which will reveal the transcendent knowledge.

Tolstoy has been called "the great criminal." Yet Tolstoy's insight into the depths, his very ability to do so without finding, rested on a sacredly realistic conception of this transcendence, an apprehension of the unity of mankind expressed in the concept of love as the mystical bond that connects us all.



If one loves everything, according to Fatih Er Zosima, they will perceive the divine mystery of things. When something grows and is alive only through its contact with mysterious worlds, losing that feeling means heavenly prosperity will die away in you.

"The Idiot" expresses a longing for a final culmination of all destinies: "What difference can it make if the tension is abnormal, or if the result itself, when remembered and examined in a healthy state, proves to be in the highest degree harmony and benefit? It gives an unheard-of and unexpected feeling of completion, balance, satisfaction, and exultant prayerful fusion with the highest synthesis of life."

There are two levels of historical analysis: the empirical, which classifies historical data by its phenomenal appearance and discovers a cyclical pattern, and the ethical, which views history as a key to action. The doctrine of historical inevitability represents the outsider's view of history—the concept of a person who has not experienced the accomplishment of an event. No representation of inevitability can absolve the individual from giving their own meaning to their existence.

Necessity describes the past, but freedom rules the future. Purposes reveal a task to be achieved—an expression of a soul, not an attribute of historical events. The ethical basis of conduct depends on the transcendental experience implied by philosophers like Plato, Kant, and Dostoevsky.

Does this mean that mysticism contains the only key to wisdom but is an obstacle to the ultimate determination of life's meaning? As Kant has already answered... morality derives from a mystical relationship with the Infinite, a personal experience which elevates man above the realm of necessity. This transcendental experience, however, enables reason to give rules of generality. The categorical imperative is not a law in the ordinary sense but a guide to action postulated by Kant's philosophy of history.
