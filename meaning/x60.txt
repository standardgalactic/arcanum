Toynbee views reliance on mimesis as doom-laden for such philosophers, suggesting it is an inevitable aspect of social dynamics. He considers this feature what distinguishes civilizations from primitive societies. Ultimately, Toynbee shifts away from the organic nature of civilizations to suggest that relations can persist independently.



The issue at hand concerns not merely relations but their nature and implications. Toynbee's analogy demonstrates the appearance of such a relation without confirming its existence. The question arises: What constitutes the common field activity? If they represent a medium of communication or their component political communities, then the original civic capabilities appear in different forms. For since these constituent socio-political entities are themselves merely relations, they cannot exhibit dynamic fields.

On the other hand, if civilizations represent the totality of their individual members, then the withdrawal-and-return by which Athens and England grew in stature—and the simultaneous rise of a creative minority—remains to be explained. Toynbee can never escape these difficulties. He tends towards the concept of civilization as the field of action for component political communities, must perforce consider these units as organic entities. This is the basis for the assertion that Athens played truant at a crucial stage in Hellenic history. This is also implied by Toynbee's conception that the domination of an ephemeral self by Athens was so pervasive that the Byzantine Empress of Athenian birth, involved in the iconoclastic controversy, exhibited the same perversion which once before had led the Athenians to reject philosophy.

The concept of the Schism in the Soul cannot be maintained if each individual of the disintegrating society exhibits these opposed attitudes. The immutability of organic functions resurfaces. Toynbee rejects futurism and archaism as false appearances, suggesting a poverty of spirit which will not be denied.



Sovereignty evaded by defining its necessity as sin. The assertion of freedom stands revealed as the mechanism of inevitability. An attempt to impose an empirical method on noumenal reality could yield no other results. Differently, perhaps a genuine growth system sets for each part of development automation requires personal agency. Each must produce outcomes as ever a narrow challenge emerges.



The tendency to determine reactions reflects society's conception as a relation, accentuating its insignificance. In social life, humans possess the power to order their affairs according to a rational plan. Society is not solely for one owner but serves as common ground for many individuals—a field of rights and obligations. The family is a household or community where practical wisdom is common in the sense that it is advice for perfection in social affairs. This aligns with Aristotle's view on the ethical dimensions of communal living.



The true implication of Toynbee's philosophy is that freedom cannot be understood through historical laws alone. Inner experience remains unsatisfied by a purely pragmatic approach. Morality does not reveal itself in maxims of prudent conduct.

Such logical schemes necessarily lead to an untenable position, as seen in the work of thinkers like John Stuart Mill and Immanuel Kant. They suggest that ethical actions must align with universal principles rather than being contingent upon historical contexts or individual circumstances. Thus, freedom involves a deeper existential understanding beyond empirical laws.



The essence of history is to be found in inner truth, based on the concept of eternal moral standards for critical rationality and ultimate tests for historical endeavors. Immortality, however, is not data or history but an inward resolve. The concept of evolution contradicts its attainability. An unfolding of growth and decay has characterized all historical existence; every stage of development, even in these terms, has lasted only a finite time. Every civilization has either collapsed or exhibited the symptoms of decline.

Sclerotic elements can be found in dialectical processes, where alienation precedes both universalization and realization. It is suggested that particularization precedes the universal state, with birth representing an ideal form of becoming. Temporal accession may contain the causality of history.

Is life the cause of death, or night of day? 

Toynbee's causality recognizes no mysteries; it tends to simplify complex phenomena into a mere series of events and consequences. This approach often lacks a deeper purpose for its interpretations, reducing them to mechanical processes rather than embracing the full complexity of causation in history.



Here is a revised version with improved spelling, grammar, and readability:

Even God is subject to normative criticism. History exhibits underlying laws; its rhythm is apparent to the discerning, and its morality succeeds.

Toynbee's approach to mythology illustrates claims that rationality denies any reality outside of fiction. Historical testament and Natural Science are qualitatively equivalent modes of apprehending an equally objective reality. Their stability in describing phenomena is determined by the quantity of data. Thus, natural science, with manageable calculations and formulae for laws, delimits the manifest possibilities of everyday existence.
