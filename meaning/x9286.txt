Kant' s nine princ iples are : 
1. All natural ap ti tudes of a c!'eature are des tined to unfold 
themselves cor.rpletely and purpos e.fu.lly . 2. As for man ( the only ratio nal creature on ear th} ., these 
na tural ap ti tudes which are direc ted toward the use o.f his 
reason wi ll d evelop fully in the apeciea ., but not in the 
indi vidu.a..l. 
3. Nature has willed tha t man should develop O Ol!I])le tely by 
hir.rn eli' every thing which goe� beyond the mocha.nic nl orcle!'­
ing of his animal exi s tenc e ., and tha t he should not partake 
of any !1app 1nes s ar pe rfection exc ept such as he has se cured 
by and for himself through his own reason , independent of 
ins tinc t •. 4. The means which m.. ture employs to produce the development 
of all mun ' s ap ti tudes 1s the a.n ta5onism in soci e ty, since 
this antagonism becomes in the end the cause of a law.ful 
order or society. 
5. 'lhe grea te st pr oblem t ar:- the species man , the s olution of 
which nature for�es upon him , 1a the es tablishment of a 
civil society which gene1•ally adminis ters the law. 
6. This prcblem is mankind's mos t di.ffi cult problem and will 
be the last solved by the species . 7. 'Ihe pr oblom cf th e. e s tablishment of' a p erfect c ivil cons t1- . tution 15 dependent upon a l awful ext ernal r ela ti on b etwe�n
