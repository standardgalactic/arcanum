**Conclusions:**

Toynbee's philosophy represents an attempt to transcend the conception of history as an organism, continuously producing manifestations of power. The inevitability of decline in nature is replaced by an assertion of purpose and agency. Challenge-and-response represents the mechanism through which growth accomplishes itself; it evokes a new element into play within the framework of historical progression.

In Toynbee's view, civilizations are not bound to decline inevitably but can adapt and respond to challenges with creativity and innovation. This approach emphasizes human potential and self-determination in shaping history, highlighting the dynamic interplay between societies and their environments.



This analysis discusses a dualism in historical exhibitions characterized by static repose and creativity, integration and differentiation, Yin and Yang. Progress results from civilizations holding new stages within an evolutionary rhythm that sustains existence. Civilizations are not organic entities with predetermined destinies; instead, they are fields of activity shaped by the limitations imposed upon them.

The discussion focuses on critiquing Toynbee's philosophical position and central concepts in his schema, without exploring ideas irrelevant to his main argument. For instance, while Toynbee suggests that Europe may be a new creative minority within the West—a criterion for growth—he also implies the West is in decline. There’s an apparent contradiction where geographical expansion accompanies breakdown against a previous description of expansion as a stimulus for new ground.

Toynbee argues that a civilization's influence over neighboring societies increases during its period of decline. This includes India, which he considers part of Western civilization due to its adoption of Western technology. Although these inconsistencies reflect on Toynbee’s precision in thinking, they do not invalidate his central position. For criteria details, see Appendix A - The Concepts of Teaching. For other incidental ideas, refer to my previous notes.

The dynamism expressed by civilizations manifests through social drills as a substitute for the direct absorption of instruction from a creative minority. Yet, growth and mechanical processes are intertwined with dynamic creativity.



I am a mino-heretic tasked with the duty to oppose the cult of the ephemeral for the sake of the eternally true. Civilizations do not break down because of an inevitable fatality but commit suicide. The tradition repeated first by men of letters is to respond to the challenges each generation faces as ads and tasks a schism in the social body.

The creative minority institutes charm, evoking a correspondingly violent reaction.



The editing within this context constitutes itself as an external proletariat constantly threatening across military fronts, gradually sapping the energy of the dominant minority. The schism in society is paralleled by a schism in the soul. All alternative ways of behavior and feeling seem doomed; however, out of the collapse of material hopes arises the vision of the ultimate meaning of human suffering—the real value of historical existence, the Kingdom of God with its kinship. The soul, which had detached itself on the mundane plane, understands the immensity of God's love, and through repentance and humility may win its way to salvation.

Toynbee’s common-sense approach pretends to derive its conclusions from a vast and impressive collection of empirical data. However, the logical antinomy of his position presents itself at every stage of Toynbee's philosophy. The realm of theology and the field of natural laws can be reconciled only with extreme difficulty. Does history reveal the gradual unfolding of a divine purpose? Or is history a natural force, obeying well-understood laws of evolution through which a rhythm of self-implementation appears for the discerning? Finally, does history merely constitute the common field of activity of constituent civilizations, its standard problem-solving self-determination, with disintegration the penalty for internal failure?

These three questions exhibit Toynbee’s conflicting tendencies. The assertion of purposefulness in the first two volumes seems to be only a proceeding emanating from or to a biological evolution—from Integration to Differentiation. In these terms, Challenge-and-Response merely appears as a beat of an elemental rhythm and a description of clean up.



The discussion centers on Toynbee's metaphysical assumptions, which draw from a medieval tradition similar to that of Dante. In this view, love is considered preparatory for the Kingdom of God. Consequently, evolutionary manifestations of the Eternal Life are critically examined, especially when viewed through a lens critical of materialism as an original sin rather than a pathway to divine fulfillment.

Toynbee's analysis often critiques historical developments like the Renaissance and modern Western society by categorizing them into archaisms, futurisms, or primitivisms. For instance, he criticizes the Renaissance for its traditionalism and the modern West for rejecting traditional norms. Similar critiques extend to other historical events, such as Japan’s modernization under the Meiji Restoration, seen as an indication of cultural suicide, while the British Empire is viewed through a lens of archaism doomed by self-destruction.

A significant consequence of Toynbee's attempt to blend theological and biological approaches is the notion that survival itself becomes a divine mandate. Sin represents the absence of this fundamental manifestation of life. Success is thus equated with moral action, reflecting a Calvinist view where success is seen as validation for one’s actions. This concept of "Transformation" is evident in his analysis, particularly when he discusses how civilizations respond to challenges and crises.

Overall, Toynbee's empirical method aims to uncover patterns from historical experiences, though it often relies on normative assumptions derived from a deep metaphysical perspective. His work underscores the tension between survival as an evolutionary imperative and its theological implications.



In a holo-caust, he has so dismally foreboded that truth would ever bring himself to the point of fleeing from the mirth to come. Of which will he begin to run—crying "Life! Life! Eternal life!" with his eyes radiant and his feet bound for a distant wickedness—and an answer to this question depended on nobody but Christ Himself. Our knowledge of the uniformity of human nature induces us to predict that Christ's imminent destination is Death, not Life.

But in the classier version of the narrative, he was not left alone to his own resources at the hour decisive for such a fate. According to John Bunyan, Christian survived by his encounter with the Evangelist. And since it cannot be supposed that God’s nature is so constant as to deny him once an opportunity which He has once given, it may be hoped that a reprobate whom God has not yet refused assistance if we ask for it will not be refused again, spirit and flesh together.

This is, of course, not inconsistent with others' opinions or propensities. For the only indication of God's favor in a world of dark mysteries is the eminence achieved by strenuous striving.

On the other hand, the impossibility of uniting general laws at phenomenological levels with the unique spirit of Christianity issues in a rejection on all possible attitudes towards life that fail to achieve that permanence which alone can indicate attaining the Kingdom of God.
