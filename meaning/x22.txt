The era of Caesarism follows a period of grand conflict, known as the "Period of Contending States," which spans from Alexander to Caesar in the Classical world, starting with Napoleon in the West. This epoch sharply presents the opposition between collective will and individual ambition. The loss of connection to communal destiny creates opportunities for individuals who seek power at any cost and personify raw force, eluding the fate of a Culture.

In this transition, great tradition—which once made genius dispensable—gives way to great men whose accidental appearances can define an era or cause its collapse upon their death. The transitional period from Culture to Civilization also produced figures like Napoleon or Alexander, where there remained a strong influence of Baroque traditions and the pulse of being had not yet entirely faded.

Culture bound all forces within strict forms. However, with the rise of Napoleonic principles, these forces were released and ultimately burst forth. Cabinet diplomacy was once confined to definite rules. The tactics of the 18th century consisted of maneuvering small armies under known conditions. But preceding Caesarism replaced absolute states with a society of battling nations.

This dynamic began in the Classical world with Hannibal and continued in the West through the World War. Warfare became increasingly violent and uncompromising. Until civilization, the techniques of war were secondary to craftsmanship. Now, the demands of continuous or potential warfare required the subservience of all mechanical means to instruments of destruction, shaping technical progress by their presumed military utility.

Universal military service and mass charges dominated battles that contemporaries of Frederick the Great would have deemed madness.

The ruthlessness of peace conditions facilitates expansion. Starting with Napoleon, 18th-century conventions of warfare were violated, limited only by physical restraints on exploiting military successes. The Treaty of Versailles deliberately avoided final peace terms, allowing victors to modify them.

Demands in changing situations reflect the inevitable product of civilization—an outward thrust to mask an inner void. After the formal end of early conflicts, the most self-assured powers emerge as the dominating force. The vacuum created by the collapse of all inner meaning is so strong that it does not matter whether a people will assume this role; they are seized and pushed into it. Rome did not conquer its Empire; rather, it condensed itself into that form, and despite Scipio's awareness of the danger, Rome could not escape its destiny. Similarly, it will be with the West. The power centers will become ever fewer, tensions greater, wars more violent. The great foci of power will decide the fate of continents until Caesarism in political form supervenes, and life gradually slips back into biological periods.

In the souls of people at this age, there is a great desire for peace. Every civilization knows the cry for reconciliation and universal understanding. But the logic of the age of Caesarism will not allow it. The Hague Conferences of 1907 and 1922 were preliminary steps toward preventing another world war, but these efforts have been overshadowed by the unfolding events leading to World War I. Civilization faces a time when aspirations for peace are at odds with the prevailing forces driving towards conflict and domination.

Does not permit a people to choose its mode of life, judging it by its "fitness" for struggle. In this task, whatever remains of old traditions representing organic factors—such as the U.S. Constitution—acquires tremendous force and can bring about historical results of great magnitude.



Title: The Ethical Evolution in Young Comoll's Thought

In the young Comoll, ethics become a form of social engineering. "Property theft," representing an ultra-materialistic conception of thought, poses the question: "What good is it for a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" However, money is merely a form of thought that orders all activity with reference to itself. Like other problems in the Culture, this dynamic will eventually reach a state or absolute inner finishedness, regardless of how powerful its present manifestations might be.

The dynamic economics of the Faustian Culture, symbolized by double-entry bookkeeping—a pure mathematical analysis of an economic condition—focuses on true values such as production and work rather than mistakenly assumed gold. This system has reached the limit of its inner possibilities. Just as thinking in terms of money gradually ceases and the force or law, the power aspect of becoming triumphs over mere acquisition, Spengler believes this may also be the fate of the Faustian machine.

No other Culture has construed its relationship to the mechanical in such a thoughtful fashion or achieved such a thoroughgoing revision of its environment. The working hypothesis ever exhibits the Faustian attitude towards the universe. Work and deed are the great ethical concepts of this Culture, with Kant's categorical imperative serving as a command for activity. However, technical knowledge will be of no avail to a soul that has lost its meaning. If the best young minds of the future no longer see life's purpose in practical pursuit and withdraw into mysticism—if succeeding generations become obsessed with the Satanism of their technological achievements—there is cause for concern.

Creations, of then not within the old legal cage, act in a way that stops the pure decay of labor. This stage will be of pure Caesarism, the formula for force, which whatever its outward trappings, depends on the personal power of its possessor. The huge citizen-mill is replaced by chiefs and their followers, private armies whose destinies depend on their leaders as in the time of Caesar, Pompey, and Octavian. The real focus or events becomes the Megalopolis in which wars of infinite bloodiness occur because of their private nature.
