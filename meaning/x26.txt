The scholarly criticism of Oswald Spengler's theory of cyclical history has been sporadic and often misses the point. Sabine offers a brief summary that is more a tirade than an analysis, while V.S. Yarros confines himself to character assassination as though he were opposing progress achieved in social legislation and liberty by Western man. The article suffers from having been written on the eve of a particularly demoniac outbreak of "progressive" West. 

The most promising analysis is probably that of Eduard Meyer. Though accepting many of Spengler's conclusions, Meyer opposes the concept of an organic culture with definite extension and fixed duration to one of overlapping cultural circles. He emphasizes their capacity for absorbing alien influences as well as their potential for different development, arguing that decline results not from excessive involvement in imperialistic ventures but can include a purposive element of human choice.

Is Spengler a determinist? This question is more complex than it might appear from a cursory reading of his philosophy. Schroeter's "Der Streit um Spengler" presents a primary analysis, suggesting that while some see him as such, there are nuances in his work indicating otherwise.



The points of tangency of an angle \( \angle AEWB \) and \( \angle CDFU \) lie on a circle named "Abendlandea - Curtis." This is part of a function called convergence. It can be argued that this volition, often perceived as a flexible concept, is not free from limitations—freedom cannot offer unlimited choice nor deterministic planning.



The question of necessity versus freedom in history involves assessing various tendencies rather than merely serving interests. Spengler acknowledged this, though his enthusiastic formula sometimes seems to undermine his theoretical awareness. The concepts of incidentality and destiny represent oppositions within historical direction—the fixed, unalterable path as destiny is realized through incidents.

For example, Columbus discovering America happened as an agent of the Spanish throne rather than the French, setting a political course for the next centuries directed by Madrid instead of Paris. A determinacy existed that the Western period should come to its culmination through absolute revolution—a process completed by the Napoleonic era in France. This incident was crucial because it complemented the cultural transition into activism.

Great individuals like Napoleon can encapsulate the essence of an epoch, achieving what might take decades for an entire class. The inner logic of events is fixed; the central tendencies of development are determined, but their incidental appearance results from the self-assurance and work of people who shape destiny rather than merely endure it.

This leads to a dilemma in all philosophy of history that emphasizes the organic aspect as passive rather than active: the connection between the necessary and the possible. This was a problem Kant considered but did not resolve conclusively.



The categorical imperative, as a foundation for eternal peace, forced Kant to demonstrate the possibility of its application. However, his proof of feasibility became a dictate of necessity and seems to negate the moral basis of the Categorical Imperative.

Similarly, Spengler concluded by posing the alternatives of doing the necessary or doing nothing. Yet this is merely a description of a psychological state rather than a guide to action. Just as the pleasure principle in psychology describes a definitional motivation toward past satisfaction but is solely useless as a standard for the prediction of future behavior.

It should be noted that Spengler's later work, "The Decline of the West," does not represent these ideas. Instead, it offers an analysis of the tendency of Western culture at its present stage. See his works on history and man’s experience of morality.



Man may always strive to do the necessary or pleasurable, varying the field of activity in which one focuses. This can take place either through the moral or material aspects of life. However, it is not merely the postulate of necessity but also the content ascribed to a consistent system that forms the real criterion for our actions and activities. According to Spencer's standard, an action is necessary if it succeeds. Yet this represents no aid whatsoever in making crucial personal or political decisions—what makes them problematical are the existence of difficult alternatives for which he offers no standard. What does he mean by success?

Consider Peter's mission to Jerusalem, a miserable moment of failure. Was his action therefore historically unnecessary? Hus was returned in Constance and Luther split the Church. Whose actions embodied necessity? Was Luther possible only because Huss was not? Some day, Protestant Christianity may disappear.

The difficulty with the pleasure principle derives from what is implied by the word "pleasure" in everyday language. The psychologist counters arguments that most people are incapable of striking a rational balance between various possible sources of satisfaction with an assertion of the unconscious factor of motivation. Since it is a fact that many persons commit acts which are actually painful, the psychologist finds refuge in a balance of greater and lesser pain. But what he is really saying is that every action must have a preponderance of motives for its performance, describing motivated activity—not merely activity—nor pleasure.

Of course, an aesthete has a perfect right to adopt any definition suitable (see Appendix A) provided they stay within the conventional boundaries of their field.



**Understanding Motivation: Pleasure, Necessity, and Cultural Influence**

The challenge in defining motivation often arises from equating it solely with pleasure. This approach merely shifts the problem without providing a clear definition. It's uncertain whether actions result from calculated measures or sheer convenience—the distinction between an action being pleasant and necessary remains blurred.

Consideration must be given to whether actions arise from necessity or happenstance, especially when viewed against the backdrop of Earth. The question arises: are such actions due to inevitability or mere coincidence? Moreover, since history functions as a reflection of cultural imagery and awareness is shaped by symbolism, both determinism and incident seem merely transient manifestations of specific depth experiences rather than applicable explanations for activity.

Two misconceptions underlie this issue: the necessity as a sanction of conduct and the confusion between the doer and the deed. These concepts suggest that actions are predetermined or justified simply because they exist within certain cultural frameworks, ignoring the complexity of human motivation.
