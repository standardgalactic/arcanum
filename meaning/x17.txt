In a rock stratum are embedded crystals of a mineral. Cracks occur, water filters in, and the crystals are gradually washed out so that only their hollow mold remains. Then come volcanic outbursts which explode the mountain; molten masses pour in, solidify, and crystallize out in their turn. But these cannot do so in their own special form. They must fill up the spaces they find available. Thus arise distorted forms, crystals whose inner aspect contradicts their external shape—a token of one kind presenting the appearance of another.

Geologists call this phenomenon pseudomorphosis. The mineral-historical pseudo-morphosis Spengler defines as the process in which an alien culture hangs so heavily over the birthplace of a young culture that the latter cannot attain its own inner development. Its spirituality is forced into strange forms, infused with new meaning but at the same time serving to certify the inner drive of the cultures' youth. Such cultures can only look on the strange form with all-consuming hatred, spending their latent creativity in half-hearted efforts, ever ready to burst through the fetters in a violent orgy.

Such was the case for Spengler of Peterina Russia, which accepted a dynastic form of government in imitation of a culture from which it was inwardly remote. Only the formless power of the early Romanovs could have succeeded in guiding this young colt that felt large cities as effeminate illusions and remained a peasantry longing for the soil no matter how large the cosmopolitanism. There developed no aristocracy that embodied a destiny, only senseless aping of alien practices. The intelligentsia grew up as an adjunct to the Court, ever bent on discovering problems not felt against the background of a peasantry that mixed hatred for the alien form stifling the culture with distrust of its own overgrowth.

Dostoevsky represents the peasant; Tolstoy, the man of Western society. The former could never in his soul get away from the land; the latter, in spite of his deeper efforts, could never get near it. Tolstoy is the spokesman of Pseudomorphism—even in his denial. His rejection is intellectual, his hatred based on property founded on economics. The very inability to shake off the West leads to his hatred of all existing forms and he therefore becomes the true precursor of Bolshevism. For Bolshevism is merely the rebellion of the lowest strata of Peterina Russia.

In society, there has always been a deep undercurrent related to Christ's legacy, yet it also represents an extreme form of degrading metaphysics. Spengler suggests this in his work (Vol. II, p. 194). This societal shift becomes a new phase known as Pseudo-morphosis.

Dostoevsky is portrayed as the true opponent of this upheaval. He embodies Russia's future and perceives both personal gain and social betterment schemes as equally meaningless. Like Christ, Dostoevsky would see no difference between working for one's own benefit or for others' societal improvement because communism could not address humanity's deeper agony. Thus, Dostoevsky represents the destiny of Russia, which is now experiencing the final stages of Pseudo-morphosis—a form filled with boundless spirituality that will be swept away by the inner logic of actualizing the Russian soul.

Similarly, the Magian soul grew within the forms of Classical Aftermath. In the East, where tales of a Messiah were prevalent and there was certainty of an apocalyptic fulfillment, the existence of immanent gods like Yahweh or Ahuramazda was felt. These beliefs had to manifest in the West through Classical culture. The classical world featured deities tied to specific places and bodies perceived sensuously nearby, with each locality having its own divinity deserving homage.

This explains why Paul misunderstood an altar to unknown Gods—intended for gods not named by foreign sailors at various seaports—as a monotheistic concept. Classical tolerance extended to all sects that did not claim exclusive validity; any transgression of these limits resulted in intermittent persecution, like the Stoics in Athens or Christians in Rome.

This also explains the shift in world-feeling towards universal reason laws of Stoicism and the mystery cults represented by Mithraism. Previously, gods were conceived as adhering to specific worship places, but now any two believers constituted a church. The Spirit or God, ready to descend upon his elect, became a universal production of this age.

Only the unparalleled symbol of Christ's passion, representing the essence of opposition between fact and truth, time and space, history and causality, distinguishes Neoplatonism, Mithraism, and Christianity. A Magian nation is a consensus of believers. When Constantine recognized Christianity as the official religion, he did not acknowledge a cult but established a new community.

Before this, the spirit of the East had already permeated Roman society.



The transformation of capital to Ilyzantium and the Divus cult made Roman Emperors akin to the first Caliphs. Yet, the spirit of the West was that of a civilization—cold and highly conceptualized. The direction of Christianity under Paul, who preached in the cities, remained aloof from the apocalyptic feeling of the countryside. This attempt at conceptually defining the Logos idea led to the violent secession of the Monophysites and Nestorians. When Islam appeared, it was greeted as a liberator by the spirit which recognized its own essence and spread with the rapidity of a soul that had been robbed of its youth and feels its time is limited.

### The Eastern Perspective: The Magian Soul

Spengler's symbol for the Magian world image is a cavern filled with dim light. In the uneasy tensions of waking consciousness, the opposition of 'becoming' and 'being,' which the Classical conceived as 'bearer and load' and the Pauline felt as force and mass, consists for the Magian of an unsure saying of substantial realities. Up and down, heaven and earth are the substances Divine that vie in a cosmos struggling with all-reality for mastery over man. Out of this basic yearning, with man as the theater of battles between the powers of darkness and evil, emerges the Concept of God the Divine Mediator who transforms this state from torment into bliss.

Man consists of soul and body, both different modes of the same substance deriving their reality and participating in the light only through the infusion of the Divine Pneuma. This serves as the condition for the heroic deeds of figures like Samson, the holy wrath of Elijah, and the enlightenment of Solomon. This infusion or divine presence into the bodies of the faithful binds a community of believers into a consensus and makes it one with the enigmatic power above. Thus, man as body and soul belongs to himself alone. But at the same time, he contains something else—something higher—an emanation of God—which elevates his existence beyond mere earthly bounds.



Certainly! Here is a revised version:

**Title:** Understanding Ego and Divine Manifestation

The ego is not the fundamental phenomenon but rather an expression of the divine within man. God is immanent in every manifestation of phenomenal appearance, serving as the underlying cause for all visible workings.

Gnostic science seeks to comprehend this substance that appears differently across actualities by purifying it from foreign elements, a process akin to alchemy. Time itself is seen as cavernous—a journey outward into salvation and enlightenment through the essence of truth.
