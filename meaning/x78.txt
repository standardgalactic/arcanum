Dewey laments that freedom does not reside in a manipulable tool of knowledge or external reality. It does not derive from an apprehension of objective necessity to be mastered as a technical problem. If, on the other hand, man's existence constitutes a mysterious relationship with the Infinite, it becomes each individual's responsibility to infuse his specificity into the inevitability of phenomena and an absolute ground for action appears necessary.

If morality reveals its basis between transcendental reality and phenomenal experience, it underscores the distinction that must be maintained. Otherwise, ethics become otiose, and naturalistic standards are equated with freedom and causality appearing as parallel appearances of the same inexorability.

Since an experience is always unique and solitary, its simultaneous appearance in others cannot be postulated. For this reason, history offers no guarantee for achievement or success.

**Dante's Man's Experience of Morality**

Man's moral norms do not exhibit values in their own right. This does not mean that the unfolding of events necessarily frustrates man. Such an opinion would also make the physical world the source of moral maxims, for the purpose of every reaction is determined by its object. This shows how absorbed the energies are in a notion of carnal pleasure and leads to the invocation of predestination as God's sanction to the elect, revealed by temporal success.

The transcendent experience of the moral law leaves the question or purposes in history undecided. Freedom is an inward state that has come to the recognition of its limits, and with that realization overcomes the inexorability of phenomena by infusing them with its spirituality.

Dante expressed this concept on the pilgrim's journey towards inward peace: "Master," I said to him, "now tell me also about this realm of which thou hast spoken to me, what is it that has the good things of the world thus within her grasp?"

And he to me: "O foolish creatures, how great is this ignorance that falls upon you. Now I wish thee to receive my judgment." He, with his eyes turned to the heavens and gave them a look so profound, said: "This is transitory; every center of creation turns over, yet it shines so brightly."

This passage reflects Dante's exploration of morality through freedom and spirituality rather than external success or pleasure.



On every other part, equally distributing his light; in like manner, for worldly goods he ordained General Ministers and guides to change betimes the vain possessions from people to people and from one kindred to another beyond the hindrance of human wisdom. Hence, one people commands while another languishes under her sentence, which knowledge is not unknown to those who cannot understand. For there are perpetual permutations with no truce; necessity makes them swift. This is why she is so much reviled, even by those who ought to praise her when blaming her loudly and with evil wordsâ€”yet she remains in bliss and hears it not.

Phenomenal reality can offer no motive force for moral action. Resignation as to the purposes of the universe provides the foundations of a meaningful ethics. 

Aristotle stated that poetry is truer than history. He meant that man's hopes reveal his essence more clearly than their incidental emergence in historical fact. Poetry testifies to humanity's immense surroundings. Poetry is truer than history for it exhibits the spirituality with which man meets the inexorability of events.

**"Redemption and Necessity Reconciled - A Clue from Poetry"**

Dante, *Inferno*, Canto 7.



The problem of freedom and necessity should therefore be referred to in literature, perhaps more purely, because the incidents of the phenomenal world are here less pervasive. This is particularly true of epic poetry, which still concerns itself with men, not things, and draws inspiration from greatness rather than a negative sentiment over social conditions. For this reason, Homer, Virgil, Dante, and Milton may give us a clue to the meaning of freedom, to the longing for self-realization that characterizes all endeavor. And if poetry is truer than history, then the state of their souls should illuminate the spirit of their age, thus explaining the growth and decay that this history exhibits.

To be sure, this will be a very inadequate analysis. But on the philosophy of history which I have indicated, it might indicate certain tendencies or norms of behavior. Dante and Milton may verify such tentative views.
