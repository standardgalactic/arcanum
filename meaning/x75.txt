How can a law be binding in reality when it lacks all probability yet still not be obligatory? This apparent contradiction resolves when we consider that Kant was quite aware that an absolute proof of impossibility is out of the question. For methodology, such an effort would be futile. If particular political circumstances do not suffice to negate the duty to work for eternal peace, if the reconciliation of all conflict is commanded against all probability—probability implying an evaluation of existing relations—then no proof for the impossibility of moral maxims is conceivable. Only an infinite mind encompassing all possible conditions could make this demonstration.

The law commands through a priori obligations and by its own inherent necessity. It expresses man's experience of that ultimate reality which lies beyond mere phenomena, transcending our current states. The recognition of a rational basis for moral experience acknowledges no limits. Wherever its maxims seem to conflict with the empirical world, Kant postulates entities which override all consideration of phenomenal reality—God, freedom, and immortality reveal the strength of an intuition that has perceived a higher world order and will not let itself be denied by the constructions of pure reason.

Kant often discusses the "possibility" of his moral maxims. However, this feasibility did not depend on an evaluation of phenomenal reality. On the contrary, Kant repeatedly asserted that the possibility of the categorical imperative is given in its very conception. For if the experience of the moral law elevates reason out of the phenomenal world and shows entities which underlie all phenomena, it transcends empirical limitations.

Kant specifically questioned a proof of impossibility. This is based on his later writings where he suggests that while scientific proof involves the evaluation of a particular set of circumstances, Kant's approach requires demonstrating absolute impossibility within the empirical world. In mathematics, for example, where all conditions are previously defined, such demonstration differs from evaluating probabilities in empirical contexts like politics.



Visible workings suggest that the physical world might preserve an idea for a universal history and guarantee eternal peace. However, this raises the dilemma of reconciling human experience of freedom with a necessary framework.

What exactly does man learn by experience? It cannot be the formulation of the categorical imperative because right cannot be taught by experience. For instance, consider the following quotations:

1. From "Theory and Practice" (Friedrich, The Philosophy of Kant, p. 429): A constitutional law has binding force without considering its outcomes since knowledge of these results is based on experience. Yet, a theory of constitutional law must align with practice to be valid, as it is grounded in principles a priori.

2. From the "Critique of Practical Reason" (Friedrich, op. cit., p. 262): The moral law reveals a life independent of animality and even of the entire world of sense through personal identity, signifying infinite value through morality.

If one looks at the mechanical implication of the moral law, experience is useful only as a counsel of prudence, not as a test for validity. Historical necessity may demonstrate 'not impossible' and 'possible,' but they cannot imply inevitability.

Kant expressed the nature of the obligation of natural law as a guide to understanding history's meaning and norms: "To harmonize practical philosophy within itself, it is necessary first to decide whether in taking of practical reason we should start from the material (i.e., substantive) principle or from its formal one—which states: Act in such a way that you could want your maxim to become a general law. Without doubt, the latter principle must take precedence; for as a principle of right it possesses absolute necessity, whereas the material principle is compelling only if empirical conditions for its realization exist."

The first principle, which conceives peace as an end, concerns the political moralist and is merely a technical task. The second principle, that of the moral politician, now considered not merely physical but theoretical, emphasizes practical action. This historical necessity is hypothetical and does not affect the argument, which explores the possibility of making such determinations in light of Kant’s analysis.



Good, but as a condition resulting from the recognition of duty, much knowledge of nature is required for solving the first problem of political prudence in order to utilize its mechanism effectively. As far as the result—eternal peace—is concerned, by contrast, the solution of the second problem of political wisdom is readily evident to everyone; it confounds all artifice and leads directly to the end.

The incongruities of Kant's critical philosophy, particularly his teleological philosophy of history, cannot be overcome even considering them as a demonstration for the possibility of the moral law. It may be argued that Kant's "Idea for a Universal History" reveals another aspect of a methodology attempting to attain knowledge by means of *a priori* principles; however, this singularity is misleading.

The categories represent forms that explain the processes of cognition. The categorical imperatives derive from a transcendental experience of freedom and reconceives personal experience with universal applicability. The content of both the categories and the categorical imperative depends on subsequent experience.

Instead of obtaining its sanction from a direct relationship to natural reality, it attempts to claim for itself aspirations or a Civic Constitution. It is therefore not analogous as all *a priori* principles to either the categories or the moral law. The categories are truly *a priori* in that they merely provide the structure for subsequent experience. The categorical imperative is beyond dispute as one admits man a transcendental experience of morality. But peace or a civic constitution (which implies lawful external relations) constitutes the instantiation of a general principle, not necessarily a mode of historical comprehension.

As a specific purpose (since it does not represent a truly *a priori* principle), it can be refuted by any other postulation or hypothetical goals. What then is this general principle? Kant's "Critique of Judgment" addresses it to the problem of a teleological conception of phenomenal reality. Kant argues that the regularity exhibited by phenomena implies a design in nature.

Just as the appearance of a hexagonal snowflake could not be explained by an accidental constellation of events but would involve a principle of purposiveness, so man can postulate a teleology in the unfolding of phenomena. It provides for the regularity of appearances and makes intelligible the consistency of natural laws. But a general principle of purposefulness does not necessarily imply knowledge of specific purposes.

Kant warns against this and draws a sharp distinction between determinative and reflective purposiveness, between derivative and constitutive design. A deterministic approach that attempts to impose its aspirations as a pattern of objective reality...

**Reality and Teleology in Kant's Philosophy**

A constructive design invokes principles such as objective immanence or phenomenal occurrence. On the other hand, Kant obtains his teleology from reflective judgment, which led him to conclude that a mechanical conception of the universe cannot account for organic aspects or growth. The design he postulates is derivative because it conceives the world as a process of becoming to make meaning through the reality revealed by pure reason. In this way, Kant completes his metaphysics and moral philosophy.

The number for cognition which the Critique of Pure Reason provided necessary forms and whose presupposed certainty was affirmed by moral philosophy now appear as principles that make causal knowledge possible. Kant calls attention to the fact that a mechanical conception of the universe cannot suffice for its understanding and that reason must add teleology, not indeed known by the methods of the first Critique but nonetheless certain.
