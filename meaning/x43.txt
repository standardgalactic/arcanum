Toynbee's ambiguous postulation of purposiveness is compounded by his theory of society as a common field of activity. If the intractability of institutions results from overlapping, dynamic fields, then individual action becomes severely limited. Only that part of a person’s sphere outside the common field remains for purposiveness. This portion must necessarily be small and insignificant.

Toynbee substitutes mechanism for organism, an imitation for an original deed. He struggles to unite metaphysical assumptions with empirical methods consistently. It never becomes clear whether he condemns the Athenians for failing to understand Plato's truths or repudiates those presented by Paul or Caesar as a mere accident of historical waves.

No support can be found in historical data for denying the inexorability of decline, especially in the face of collapse.



The proposition of a One True God in Christianity as a logical consequence of Toynbee's theology rejects the very pattern of recurrence necessary to establish a historical law. For a God cannot be both exclusive and an accidental result of a civilization.

The deficiency of moral standards implied by the use of force may be well founded in theology, yet the only criterion empirical data admits is failure. Thus, Toynbee's ultimate proof resides in technical excellence; his final standard of values is the ability to prevail.

### The Disintegration of Civilizations - Schism in the Body Social

The breakdown of civilizations issues into disintegration: a civilization’s capacity to react to challenges becomes permanently stifled. The sense of frustration within the body social leads to a dispersion that dissipates the strength of the civilization.

Toynbee's analysis of the disintegration of civilizations represents the culmination of his philosophy and the revelation of his metaphysical construct. Out of the ashes of the City of Destruction emerges a profounder level of world experience, the supra-mundane level of reality. The period of breakdown had circumvented the creative force of the civilization for realizing their potentialities. Though this static condition exhibits a level of integration, its duration is ephemeral. Since it was attained outside of God's plan, such unity cannot last.

Against this negation of creativity, the secession of the internal proletariat constitutes a dynamic reaction. Yin changes to Yang again. Humanity proceeds on its journey up the precipice. The universal church which salvages the purposelessness in life gives content to the void in the soul and reveals truths of eternal validity.

Toynbee's metaphysical dilemma is ever-present, however. How can the ascetic consequence of social breakdown become the theme of history? How can an empirical value account for the sanction of evolution? Toynbee suggests a middle ground between the biological and theological interpretation of his history, considering permanence as a criterion for future fitness.

Do the possible inward reactions to a state of disintegration exceed what is institutionally established? Toynbee's empiricism forces consideration of permanence as a criterion for forward movement. The histories of civilizations contain the moral sanction of history from which one can learn rules not only for morality but also at times of successful conduct. Does salvation or hope reside in phenomenal appearance or inner experience? It is the Kantian query again, the original dilemma restated, containing our metaphysical standard for the interpretation of Toynbee.

If breakdown reveals an inevitable failure of self-determination to disintegration, what then is the alternative? Toynbee turns to a well-tried empirical method. Just as birth does not necessarily involve growth, so breakdown does not inevitably lead to collapse. The alternative to disintegration is perfectionation, a state of creative impotence. Its dominant presence suggests potential for renewal and transformation rather than mere decay.



This is a form of totalitarism that emphasizes the timeless evenness of existence, under which philosophy and art may continue to grow. However, growth reveals a process of differentiation, where each unique challenge arises as a function of the prior response.

For full discussion, see "Conclusions" and Appendix A - The Couple of Meaning.

Toynbee relies heavily on a combination of Spengler's Caesarism and feudal state dynamics. In contrast to integration, where meeting the problem results in the continuous confrontation of varied challenges, disintegration involves the standardization expressed in a universal state, such as an empire or church, accompanied by mass migrations like the Völkerwanderung.

Toynbee identifies one criterion for disintegration in the existence of a schism within the social body—a division into incompatible social groups. While growth phases also feature some differentiation, their organization is hierarchical and based on common devotion to values constituting the social technique. This results in divisions or classes that reflect merely a distribution of labor.

However, during disintegration, the claim to leadership evaporates, with the creative minority ruling by force. The division into classes now forms an internal proletariat, while beyond the state's borders lies an external proletariat threateningly facing the dominant minority.

Any attempt to heal the schism within the social body leads to failure, as the loss of creativity prevents any exception or resolution.



The unhappy souls struggle with makeshift solutions. Toynbee believes that the Marxian philosophy accurately describes a civilization moving toward collapse under an ever-greater accentuation of oppositions. However, the Old Testament strain in Marxism also transcends economic conditions and expresses humanity's longing for a Promised Land that reconciles all striving. In this vision, oppressors and oppressed will vanish, and harmony will reign everywhere. This intuition of peace through suffering and happiness through agony does not merely represent despair but rather an aspiration for ultimate reconciliation.



For Toynbee, a schism is not just a division but an event with immanent purpose. It represents a phase in the elemental rhythm of Yin and Yang. Schism-and-Palingenesis appears, like Withdrawal-and-Return, as another aspect of this rhythm. It illustrates how the condition of dynamic activity maintains itself. The schism represents withdrawal. A dominant minority has forced society into a static mold by clinging to its position against all equity. This creates an internal proletariat that constitutes a dynamic disturbance in the uneasy equilibrium.

The internal proletariat withdraws to work out solutions for the next phase of development, sharing its agony with a small group or inspired individuals—this new creative minority. They utilize their capacity for mimesis to control the mass of the internal proletariat. In relation to this dynamic group, the dominant minority merely constitutes an anomaly.
