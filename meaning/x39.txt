A lot has been written about ancient Greece by creative thinkers, particularly in the personal studies on the subject and the section on Western development. A significant part of Hellenic history is covered in the third chapter concerning England's role in Western development.

At a time when many Greek city-states were engaged in overseas expansion, Athens chose a different path. They withdrew into isolation and focused their efforts on developing their democracy at home. This approach contributed to the deepening of Athenian political culture and population growth.

The development of this internal focus marked a significant phase in the history of Western civilization, highlighting the unique trajectory that Athens took compared to its contemporaries.



Serious Greeks achieved great success through specialization and manufacture. This signaled their return to the Greek scene by challenging Toynbee's theory.

For an essential discussion on the incongruity between the movements in Toynbee’s analysis, see "Generalizations" (Discussion of Methodology).

Regarding the Achaemenian Empire, please note that detailed discussions can be found without referring to unnecessary page numbers.



For over two hundred years, Athens was the exact antithesis of its previous condition as a colony. The institutions developed during this period proved their superiority over their Spartan counterparts, which had broken down while Athens became the "education of Hellas."

Similarly, England's insular position enabled her to solve the most serious challenge of the 17th century faced by Western civilization. By breaking down feudal barriers within her domain and substituting democratic government for aristocratic dominance, she achieved the transformation from an agrarian society to an industrial one. When the Glorious Revolution brought England back into the European scene, the Continental powers found there a model for their adaptation or emulation.

This may be Russia's role in the Western world. The early Communist tendencies of absolute isolation may well constitute that withdrawal which finds the proper response to the all-pervasive Western challenge of nationalism. Brought by technology into the Western pattern, Russia will perhaps return to serve as the creative minority in the next stage of Western development.

Growth complicates itself through the agency of a creative minority. Toynbee believes this may be Russia's role: initially isolating itself only to later reintegrate and innovate within the global context.



A can serve as a creative catalyst for societal transformation. It is essential to understand that civilizations progress through a series of overbalances, each successful resolution creating a new challenge. This process involves growth rather than determined imitation.

In Toynbee's scheme, the growth of civilizations exhibits a pattern based on metaphysical assumptions. His concepts depend heavily on Dante’s ideas, resembling Dante's Mount Purgatory more than anything else. The state of "Will" in Toynbee’s theory allows for mutual illumination similar to how Dante's Divine Comedy works: each part can illuminate the others through thought.

Toynbee argues that civilizations face unique problems, each serving as a challenge and an ordeal. The accessible solution of one problem propels civilization into new challenges largely determined by previous responses. Unlike Spengler, who believed each Culture possesses a soul revealed through its appropriate symbolism, Toynbee denies this, opting instead for a process based on sequential overbalances.

However, this empirical method leads to logical inconsistencies and philosophical difficulties, as observed previously.



The assertion that etherealization exhibits the liberation of energy for higher tasks finds no support in historical data. Higher and lower do not constitute categories of empirical experience, as Immanuel Kant pointed out in his "Refutation of Ethical Egoism." Instead, they represent normative patterns of rationality.

On the other hand, etherealization was merely a technical transfer brought about by the physical expansion of civilization. In fact, Toynbee's views waver between his theological concepts of inner self-determination and etherealization as merely a product of civilization’s growth (Environmental). As an empiricist, Toynbee sees the problems of Western civilization as consequences of technological mastery. However, there is inconsistency in pointing out that an advance in technology accompanies simplification and at another point considering Gandhi's return to the spinning wheel as symptomatic of a yearning for self-articulation. What is the connection between these realms of necessity and freedom? Do arrested civilizations result from an insurmountable challenge or a deficient response?

Toynbee’s criticism of Spengler is curiously inept. Spengler's assertion that a Culture is an organism did not align with Kant's views on practical reason.

For further development of this point, see the post-conclusions section (JB2).
