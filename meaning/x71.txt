The task is to derive the will by the categorical imperative on the basis of a priori considerations. The goal of achieving personal happiness, not derived from external experiences, transcends traditional concepts. In Kant's "Critique of Practical Reason," it is emphasized that moral law must be determined through reason alone, independent of empirical influences. The categorical imperative provides a framework for understanding duty and morality based on rationality, rather than contingent outcomes or desires. This approach underscores the importance of autonomous will in ethical decision-making.



If the categorical imperative commands the movement toward eternal peace, no mental reservations should leave room for parallel laws that excuse a violation of it. If the moral law's imposition on the state resides in its concept of man as an end—expressed in a General Will—then there is no technical reason to tether it to the possession of the ruler. This reduces the state from a moral person to a thing and violates the categorical imperative.

For the moral law commands that we treat men as ends, no consideration of utility can legalize standing armies. Professional soldiers become mere tools, whose very existence creates a constant state of insecurity. No violation by other states can serve as an excuse for war. The very presence of oppression should act as a stimulus for others to implement the categorical imperative. To work for peace represents one's most difficult duty to carry through.

The pervasiveness of the moral law in Kant's philosophy of history now becomes apparent. Compliance with the categorical imperative contains the moral function of the political world. In this sense, the formulation of diplomatic documents, the maintenance of armies, the utilization of economic means for foreign policy, and the employment of force are violations of a moral law, of which even the command for eternal peace represents but a particular instance.

Kant's exposition of freedom in a determined world translates into ethical activity and furthers humanity's guide on its journey through history.



Kant realized that applying categorical imperatives to specific instances could not provide the ultimate foundation for eternal peace, a three-dimensional article of such significance. In his conception, the basis of peace involves more than merely the absence of war; it includes the promotion of the moral law in the cultural realm.

Kant argued that a true state of peace results, at least in part, from lawful institutions within nations. If the attainment of peace is a moral law, it can only be achieved by morally virtuous persons. However, how can the dictates of categorical imperatives operate in social and political institutions? Just as the moral law contains the objective principle of all actions, so does a republican constitution represent the norm of political institutions.

What constitutes a republican constitution? Kant posits that members of society are regarded as men; the principle of dependence on a single common legislation is established for subjects; and the principle of equality for all citizens. The republican constitution thus initiates what Kant's categorical imperative advocates: it asserts man’s intrinsic value, expressing the transcendental experience of freedom. It embodies the principle of dependence upon common legislation in a Kingdom of Ends where each individual is both subject and legislator.

This structure tests moral attitudes—feeling responsibility towards others’ rights and motivating action from a conception of the common good. A political community based on this apprehension of man as an end in itself echoes the synthesis of liberty expressed in the righteousness of the will, exemplified by equality through the universal applicability of its laws. Since the republican constitution institutionalizes the categorical imperative, it enables individuals to become moral persons subject to maxims derived from such principles.



The transcendental exposition of freedom, as articulated by Friedrich in "The Philosophy of Kant" (page 437), aligns with Rousseau's concept of the general will. In this context, the state is conceived as a moral person to which the moral law applies in political events and reality.

The categorical imperative now appears as a positive force guiding public opinion, morality, and politics—never allowing submission to the pervasive reflection of a traditional norm expressed through the lip service paid to international law by thinkers like Grotius, Pufendorf, and Vattel. Peace treaties always claim the sanction of abstract justice, while wars are defended on moral grounds. Humanity's dim apprehension of martial might cannot bear fruit until its maxims have been institutionalized.

The emergence of the republican constitution makes possible the foundation of an eternal peace based on universal principles. Kant envisions replacing the violence of the state of nature with harmony and security, ending constant strife. The federation of free states contains Kant's vision for reconciling all conflicts. Although his idea of considering all things as ends inclines him toward a union of nations, his awareness of political realities leads him to accept a federation of republican states instead.

Kant can do this without sacrificing the independent validity of his moral maxims because he understands the complexities of applying moral principles in practical politics. This vision allows for peace and cooperation without undermining fundamental ethical standards.



In the state as a moral person, the maxims of universal law become universally applicable. Now peace emerges from discord through reconciliation, conflict, and general basis for peace creation apart from those conflicts. In the majesty of the moral law, we read the feasibility of its eternal peace.

Eternal peace appears as the realization of man's moral potential within a federalism of states.



Kant's second definitive article states, "The law of nations ought to be based upon a federalism of free states." Kant's conception of a commonwealth involves encouraging contact among nations but also implies a denial of the right of conquest. Although humanity is divided into many components separated by oceans and deserts, the globe represents a common possession of mankind. Kant argues that people have the right to visit every part as long as they do not assert their rights by force and are bound by the principle of hospitality. Thus, all nations' law must guarantee the exploitation of or access to all lands for indigenous inhabitants while preventing the violation of human dignity. This reveals the highest categorical imperative which compels Kant's notion of Eternal Peace (Friedrich op. cit., p. 451).



The experience of the moral law constitutes a connection with ultimate reality that man can only feel, never fully know. Any violation of its dictates affects the dignity of all men in every part of the world. Each person is responsible to humanity for their will given universally through maxims, whether good or evil.

Kant states, "The Commonwealth of nations or world law must be linked to conditions of universal hospitality." In his essay on Eternal Peace, Kant continues the symmetrical edifice of his philosophy. The Critique of Pure Reason affirmed the possibility of the experience of freedom, while moral philosophy gave it meaning. In the Philosophy of History, the moral law that lifts man above himself stands revealed as a normative principle governing political events. No conflict between theory and practice is conceivable here; indeed, the categorical imperative represents practice in an objective sense.

Humanity's aspirations disclose history with meaning because only through the experience of freedom does man apprehend reality, which produces all phenomena. The moral law represents the assumptions underlying all purposeful activity; approximation to its maxims constitutes the sole test of moral fitness.
