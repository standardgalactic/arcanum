Tolstoy chose death rather than the ignominy of treachery. Toynbee then turns next to an examination of the impact of disintegration on the plane of feeling. The loss of Promethean elan of growth places a burden upon the soul, akin to the very negation or reparation of presence.

The sense of drift, often associated with feelings of rootlessness or aimlessness, is frequently linked to sin—a perception that drifting results from self-idolatry, negligence, or chance. This concept illustrates a profound correlation between fate and the subjective feeling of being adrift in life. Objectively, this drift can be seen as an inevitable consequence leading to broken dreams and forces like chance, which act as expressions of chaos. These forces represent both subjective disorder and their objective manifestation as inevitable aspects of human experience.

Western culture, since its early days, has elevated concepts such as laissez-faire into metaphysical realms through scientific inquiry. However, fate itself has been a subject of adoration. The Calvinist doctrine of predestination, which counters the Hellenic Tyche, introduced determinism into the lives and fortunes of human beings.

While an idolization of fate can serve as an opiate to instill acceptance in the soul when facing assumed disasters, it also highlights the tension between free will and predetermined outcomes. This interplay is central to understanding how humans navigate their existential landscapes amidst forces beyond their control.



The roots of a nation lie in external circumstances, its counterpart being the realm of spirit as a powerful stimulus. Maintaining an inward focus offers an explanation for one's failure and attempts to make oneself worthy of receiving God's grace. The road from unconquerable necessity to conquerable sin is the saving truth that prevented Judaism from rushing into disaster through the dissolution of an ephemeral self.

The Hellenic Civilization had to discover this great truth humbly, but the West was destined to emerge from the chrysalis of a higher religion. Nothing illustrates the perseverance of human nature better than these patterns we see today. The rejection of traditional values and the repudiation of sin manifest as passive substitutes for the lost sense of style that has disappeared with the breakdown of society.

As an example or promiscuity appears in response, it becomes widespread across all spheres of activity and social classes. Toynbee notes its influence, observing pronounced tendencies toward promiscuity among minority groups. These groups often adopt military techniques from successful neighboring civilizations. As armies expand to fulfill the insatiable requirements for achieving a universal state, an extensive dilution accompanies this expansion.

Common military service vulgarizes the dominant majority. The lack of inward strength forces the dominant majority to follow immediate trends. When Christianity was small and lacked popular support, Rome's persecutions were persistent if half-hearted. However, once Christianity achieved prominence, the dominant minority willingly followed the internal pretorians' lead by announcing their own conversion.

The dominant minority's barbarization matches its vulgarization. The establishment of a military frontier reflects this shift.



The external proletariat often threatens to erupt in testsifies.

Toynbee op. cit., Vol. V, p. 439, discusses how the moral fiber of a dominant minority is steadily degenerating, thereby inclining towards barbarian reversion. This leads to attempts to solve the challenge by enrolling barbarian war-bands into national service—a scenario akin to imprisoning prisoners in one's own house. This was evident in Rome and may occur with the Indian army, where the large majority is recruited from the external proletariat.

Vulgarity in art and manners is a consequence of disintegration. The Western artist unconsciously turns his back on his great tradition, similar to a Hellenic predecessor. Nigger dances and Byzantine archiecture constitute expressions that must remain foreign to the souls of true Western creators, dooming their present improvisators to sterility.

In the field of language, the sense of precariousness reveals itself in the replacement of local distinctiveness by general confusion. The requirements of communication within a universal standard lead to the emergence and decline of languages such as Hellenic Greek, Latin, English, and French.



The Western, such as a village's Aramaic tone, is also an example of religious syncretism—a manifestation of Toynbee's concept. This idea emphasizes the blending of different religious and philosophical traditions. The unnecessary notes and page numbers have been removed for clarity.



A sense of profound solitude arises from the schism of the soul in an age of disintegration. The history of all universal states exhibits a convergence toward domination by a common type of leadership. During periods between Rome and the Middle Ages, there was little synchronization among various religious sects and cultural centers.

The discussion concerning these phenomena reveals differences in approach and understanding throughout history. Despite this lack of synchronization, the influence of dominant empires and their ideologies persisted across regions and eras, shaping societies and cultures along similar lines. This convergence often led to a shared experience of solitude as traditional structures disintegrated or transformed under new influences.

As these universal states emerged and fell, they reflected broader trends in governance and social organization, where the quest for power often overshadowed spiritual unity and cultural diversity. The resulting isolation of individuals and communities was both a symptom and a consequence of this historical process, highlighting the tension between collective identity and individual experience.
