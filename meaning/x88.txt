The judgment represents only an announcement about something, questioning it focuses on the object which constitutes the logical subject of the proposition. The assertion then escapes to affirm or deny a hypothesis. It exhibits more clearly the object of our query than the judgment because it is devoted to the psychological aspect of the act of judging, in which there always lies the possibility of error.

The interrogative is the assertive logic at work before which what form should this interrogative take? Three possibilities exist. Taking these into consideration:

(a) The Abstract Method  
What we affirm or deny is "the largeness of Chicago." This contains all the linguistic difficulties if a question is raised regarding the answer: Is it true that the largeness of Chicago is true?

(b) The Interrogational Method  
The question "Is Chicago large?" What we affirm or deny. The thought exhibited in this arrangement seems fully adequate but is also linguistically awkward.

(c) The Descriptive Method  
The hypothesis to be affirmed or denied is: "Chicago is large." This method directly addresses the subject matter and is less prone to confusion.



The primary aim here is to present a clear hypothesis that allows for examination before making an assertion or decision regarding its truth. A large concept, such as "chicken," becomes the descriptive hypothesis offered for examination and affirmation or denial.

The act of assertion occurs when the descriptive statement has been fully examined. However, this recognizes that judgments of truth and falsehood are subjective and dependent on a meta-physical context. Moreover, simple assertions of truth and falsity are ambiguous since they say nothing about the criterion used as a standard.

### Probable Assumptions

It is essential to have criteria or standards for making judgments about hypotheses. As we assess such statements, it's crucial to consider these underlying assumptions that guide our understanding and acceptance of what might be true or false.



It appears that within empirical research, certain subgroups may be numerically defined in a way where traditional logic might not apply effectively. This brings us to a critical point regarding the structure of analysis and the formulation of judgments.

In traditional logic, meta-physical assumptions often proved cumbersome. By expanding the range of allowable judgments, logic has evolved into what we now call declarative form. This represents an acknowledgment that objective criteria for analysis are absent, and consensus serves as the only approximation to universality. In this framework, the act of judgment (represented by the cost in the declarative exhibition) contains a philosophical element.

The descriptive component includes the logical portion, which is integral to internal structure. The assertion of truth or falsity becomes an epistemological viewpoint rather than a direct empirical verification. 

If the declarative statement derives from these two components, can any criterion for its evaluation exist without objective standards? No clear criteria are available for verifying its universal applicability. Consequently, declarations become subject to epistemological criticism.

Ultimately, no ultimate criteria for measuring or establishing truth can be derived solely through propositional logic. Thus, a claim such as "The earth being large" is empirically positive but lacks definitive, objective measures for verification within the logical framework.



One-third of total meaning is not exhausted by empirical verifiability, and proper standards can be obtained for aesthetic or value judgments. If logic is defined as the critical analysis of inherent structures independent of their relation to other fields, then the logical positivists have offered a better solution. It does not rely on epistemological presuppositions but attempts to analyze the implications of hypotheses before final judgment or validity assessment.

This approach suggests that empirical experience and rational thought are more likely to lead to corroboration or variability in meaning. Even if the hypothesis continues with some possible answers, the very formulation of the query is recognized as a function of the structure of reality dependent in part on their effect on systematic knowledge. Are these hypotheses consistent, and are their choices accidental or their properties purely psychological? These problems arise from the terms defined.

A system has been defined as any body of propositions such that some or all of the proceeding propositions can be deduced from it. The body of propositions that imply the rest has been defined as the code by Professor Scheffer.

The necessity for a code results from the limitations of the human mind. A being, such as God, whose knowledge is instantaneous, would have no need for a code. Yet every person, who cannot grasp the totality of the propositions contained in the system without deduction, requires a body of propositions from which such deduction can be effected. Few classical sciences and no applied ones have been completely axiomatized, though their logical structure presupposes a system, its extent usually indicated by the necessity to attend to conclusions.

Historically, it had been assumed that all systems, such as Euclidean geometry, were based on a network of propositions.



It is evidently true that axioms, from which 11 other propositions and theorems follow deductively, can no longer be considered universally self-evident. Mathematics has proved, however, that Euclidean axioms cannot be universally self-evident.
