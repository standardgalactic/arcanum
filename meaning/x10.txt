Why did Hus burn, yet Luther split the church? What is the real meaning behind the triumph of Christianity? Spengler might argue that it was simply because the time was ripe. However, this does not mean self-contained being is no more possible than all-pervasive becoming. Perhaps Christ experienced a profound sense of religious alienation in a strange, remote world. The sentry under the Cross may have heard His anguished cry that God had forsaken Him. Yet, it wasn't the case—as Spengler asserts—that the sentry represented the facts of history but rather the man on the Cross.

It might be maintained that if Christ had never existed, some belief system akin to his would have triumphed in the form of mystery cults. It is within this "something" that these ideas find their enduring influence.



The discussion revolves around the interplay between necessity and freedom, as well as the tension between organic growth and conscious intention in societies. It raises questions about whether individual behavior can be predicted based on common experiences alone, suggesting that inner experience and external effect are intertwined.

W. Y. Elliott's "The Pragmatic Revolt in Politics" touches upon this by asking what necessity accomplishes itself under the guise of freedom. The text draws a parallel between being and waking-being as two connected modes of human existence: organic and purposive.

Oswald Spengler, in his analysis of cultural growth and decay, sees history as an organic process marked by the gradual decline of conscious awareness. He distinguishes between cultures—expressions of eternal rhythms—and civilizations, which represent a continuously declining cosmic beat. For Spengler, existence is akin to a biological process where meaning emerges only with the development of cultures.

Primitive humanity was engaged in a constant struggle for survival, leaving little room for profound ideation or lasting religiosity, dependent on its supposed power over life-threatening enigmas. Around 3000 B.C., significant cultural forms emerged, each with their own inner conception of destiny, bringing about fundamental changes.

In summary, the text explores themes of necessity versus freedom, organic growth versus conscious intention, and the cyclical nature of cultural development as envisioned by thinkers like Elliott and Spengler.



Spengler posited that a transformation in the human constitution occurs at certain times. From then on, man no longer trusts his world-image or depends on his experience alone, but as part of an experienced whole. The degree of interrelationship between this experience and lived expression varies with common membership in a culture.

Each culture constitutes an organic being with growth, maturity, old age, and death. They awaken in a moment of infinite longing when the fear of death, the end of the world, and the dark mystery of the universe oppress everyone's heart. Such was the time when at the birth of Greece, the Mæonian soul attained life, when the Classical soul was dispersing itself in Neoplatonism and the Oriental mystery cults. Similarly, such was the moment around 900-1000 AD, when the end of the world seemed near, and out of the confused groping of the Merovingian and Carolingian period—the upward-striving soul of Western (Pauline) culture emerged. At these moments, in the higher minds of the young culture, the environment suddenly coalesces into a meaningful picture. All the problems and possibilities of future history are already immanent in the formations of those early years, in the construction of its Grand Myth.

Each culture begins with a great renunciation: the refusal to take over the symbols of the preceding civilization, the rejection of its official representations. Even outward manifestations of other cultures that are adopted have unique, solitary content that is essentially incomprehensible to outsiders. The myth of each culture contains its image of the world, the essence of its longing, the possibility of its nature-knowledge, and the basis of its religion. All of its later history reveals a process of actualizing this idea and fighting against forces that tend to dissolve it from within (waking-consciousness) and the material dangers of the environment. Since birth occurs in a moment of oppressive tension, all early manifestations of human endeavor are essentially religious. Natural science emerges only as a complement to the gradual self-assertion of waking consciousness. Spengler considers both manners of these same phenomena: "World-knowing for the man of higher culture is a need as much as it is a duty of expressing his essence."

The culture grows in a land area and remains tied to it for the remainder of its existence. In the biological period that precedes the historical era, a peasantry develops close to the soil and feels the rhythm of the cosmic beat. Out of the anonymous countryside emerges at the beginning of each culture a feudal order whose essence is expressed in a customary ethic that does not frame references as good and evil but rather as good and bad, with its stigma attaching to vulgarity rather than sin. The aristocracy represents the world of fact and the meaning of what is about to happen; the peasantry makes its history, while the aristocracy marks it.

A priesthood also appears born out of world-fear.



The concept of a mediator between man and God, often perceived as enigmatic during the early period, is influenced by the style and role of that priesthood. This depends on the culture's symbols and depth of experience. The Faustian man represents a lonely ego in an infinite world or force, extending himself persistently. In this view, Goethe’s Faust becomes a reflected version of man who faces all sides but finds no side to hold onto.



The fear of the devil requires a powerful priesthood and the possibility or understanding of forgiveness. The Apollinian soul, in all essentials almost the exact opposite of the Pauline, with its reliance on pure presence against the background of a fear of the Golden Calf or pedestal, accepts or at least offers a strong denial of priesthood as innate.

The Magian cave-world, where the divine pneuma hovers uneasily over man who might ever fall to the forces of evil and whose salvation consists in the containment of the believers, produces a type of nation that is a church. The existence of Springtime outside represents a living metaphysics; each manifestation is a tentative groping towards the knowledge it will have during its noon.



The harmony of the countryside begins to be disturbed by the emergence of towns. Initially, these are merely marketplaces—though primitive peasants have always regarded even technical mastery of nature with mixed awe and tenor (such as blacksmiths)—they develop into places from which the countryman is henceforth excluded. This marks the age when Scholasticism appears, an assumption for the permanence of the world.

The growth of the city involves the emancipation of intellect. The liberated waking-consciousness begins the process of dominating the organic factor, until with the complete destruction of the great focuses, shapeless Caesarian rule settles all problems. Formerly, knowledge was faith supported; but with the growing aura of its powers, it becomes a contested faith.

The countryside fights a losing battle against the city, which represents forces such as events in the political field against democracy, the spirit against nationalism, and the economic against money. The spirit of the city is critical and practical. Life, which used to be lived out of the self-evidence of its meaning, develops into a calculation of utilitarian purposes. The great tradition itself becomes questionable.

Spengler finds similar tendencies in the religious field. The political requirements of a growing culture had involved faith in the affairs of the world-of-facts. The face of spirit that sees the purpose of religion in the negation of this world, in the restraint of blood, and that opposes the timeless love of God to the love of the sexes, rises to a final effort. Reformation stands at the end, not at the beginning, of a religious development.
