Pure reason can go no further than making room in its metaphysical scheme for the ultimate reality that may reveal itself to man through theological, aesthetic, and moral experiences. On the other hand, pure reason can show the limitations of both Rationalists and Empiricists. The phenomenal reality does not exhaust the totality of human experience.

Freedom cannot be derived from a recognition of natural necessity. If sensible experience is confined to the appearances of things, then the empirical world cannot contain a moral sanction. The experience of freedom in a determined environment is seen as potentially meaningful.



The meaning of life becomes the concern of a person's identity rather than an attribute of the empirical world. Purpose resolves in the soul. Freedom does not have a place in a determined universe.

The rigor and symmetry of Kant’s method cannot be overemphasized. No other philosopher had a clearer grasp of the implications of our experience of freedom within a causal world. He fully recognized the importance of a profound metaphysics for apprehending total reality, which was not, however, expressed by the categories of pure reason.

Kant's metaphysics, which traced the boundaries of human knowledge and at the same time opened vistas to ultimate experience, serve as the condition for the apprehension of an entity that gives the most profound expression to the intrinsic worth of a more perfect personality—the transcendent experience which connects man with the Infinite.

For two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing awe and admiration, the more frequently and continuously reflection is occupied with them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within. The former begins with the place I occupy in the external world, while the latter concerns the internal realm of moral consciousness.



World in which the sense calculus, and label: explainable value stands on the essence of any number of worlds to the extent that I find a system within systems, without being limited by periodic motion, their beginnings and perpetual motion. The second (the moral law) starts from my invisible self, my moral personality, and depicts me in a world of true infinity which can be sensed only by the intellect. With this recognition, I am linked to myself to be in a nice series and general communion not just accidentally or seemingly to be the case with the physical world. Through this recognition, I see my essence as a number linked antity.

Cleaned-up version:

In a system where worlds exist, there is one particular world characterized by periodic motion, beginnings, and perpetual movement. The moral law originates from an invisible self, representing my moral personality in a realm of true infinity that can be understood only through intellect. This recognition links me to myself as part of a coherent series, not just accidentally or seemingly related to the physical world. Through this recognition, I perceive my essence as being interconnected with others.



All worlds are visible deserts to those who have not come to see. My import is that "the thing" itself, these sights we call life, might be the only true essence. Amidst this existence, as an animal comes to an almighty truth, there's a need for perspective. 

In my second view, I realize my value infinitely increases as an intelligence, revealing more than what meets the eye. Clean up your understanding of the universe; realize every experience is a frame within which you exist.



Through a careful examination of autonomy, we explore the profound nature of individuality and personality in relation to moral law. It's important to recognize that while freedom is an inward state that elevates humanity beyond mere necessity, it raises essential questions about the nature of morality itself.

Kant's ethics, rooted in transcendental experience, suggest that the essence of appearances lies within this concept of freedom. This inward freedom allows individuals to perceive their divine mystery and purpose. However, a critical question arises: How can moral law maintain any content or universality when the experience of freedom is intensely personal? Is morality defined by conformity to explicit regulations, or does it emerge from an inner state that gives meaning to those regulations?

In his "Critique of Pure Reason," Kant rejects both Rationalist and Empiricist views. Objective necessity, as understood through natural laws, cannot alone constitute the essence of moral law. Instead, moral law must transcend mere rational deduction or empirical observation.

Thus, morality may not be fully expressed by adhering to explicit rules but might instead arise from an inner disposition that aligns with universal principles. This view challenges us to consider how personal freedom and universal ethical laws can coexist and inform each other in the formation of a moral world.



Ethical hedonism is inadequate because it denies direct experience by focusing solely on pleasure as the ultimate goal, preventing the formulation of a universal rule for happiness. The happiness posited by hedonistic theories is limited to sensual pleasures and does not account for higher mental satisfaction or moral considerations.

Hedonism fails to recognize that personal freedom involves more than just seeking individual pleasure; it overlooks broader societal implications. It suggests multiplying personal gratifications without considering their potential harm to others or society as a whole, thus failing the test of universal applicability.

The Epicurean concept distinguishes between higher mental and lower bodily pleasures but does not fully address the complexities involved in human happiness. Ethical hedonism lacks consideration for intellectual pursuits and altruistic actions that contribute significantly to personal growth and societal well-being.

In summary, while ethical hedonism prioritizes pleasure, it inadequately addresses the multi-dimensional nature of true happiness, which includes moral development, intellectual fulfillment, and social responsibility.
