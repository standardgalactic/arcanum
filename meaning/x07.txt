Immanuel Kant, in his exploration of transcendence, presents a corollary to demonstrate the kingdom of ends where each person is both subject and sovereign, embodying the highest concept achieved by Western thought—the dignity of individual inclinations. The relationship between morality and history can be understood through this lens.

The categorical imperative serves as an essential guide for thought at certain attitudes. Viewing the succession of growth and decay, Kant suggests that without a transcendent point like the "man-god," magic cannot find relation, necessitating recourse in a termistic psychology.

Kant does not explicitly state this, but his proposition of God—freed from randomness—implies it. The categorical imperative can only serve as an essence of thought to a certain attitude. In the pursuit of Eternal Peace, rather than merely consoling ourselves, we recognize life's inherent processes of death and decay, where power appears as a criterion for value.

Despite this inevitability, humility emerges with a recognition of our limits. The Delphic maxim "Know thyself" is not just psychologically but morally oriented: you are human and not God. From the acceptance of these limits develops a feeling of reverence, guiding us toward moral dignity and ethical living.



A story is not merely a narrative, nor is mankind simply a tool or an end in itself. History reveals the concept of immortality to be that of man as an instrument rather than God, with its full implication being the concept of tolerance—the fundamental basis for the dignity of moral personality of the individual.

Yet a last dilemma emerges. Even though our contemplation of history yields its deepest meanings through the fulfillment of the ultimate moral personality of man, we are still faced with the fact that no civilization has yet been permanent; no long-lasting answer has ever gone unchallenged. It is a difficult question and one must not reply dogmatically.

It is not easy to define what degree of permanence or hope of ultimate fulfillment a value or an attitude requires. Perhaps the experience of living gives us a clue. We know we will die without sense or certainty. Yet, even as second ago, our actions were believed to be truly freely willed, and yet we entertain no doubt of our freedom at each new situation that comes. Despite the limits of our lives, we know our vocations are irreversible and even in imminent vitality, we place absolute reliance. We can live this dilemma only by some measure of acceptance and with the knowledge of the transience of our lot, with a mode of permanence.

This acceptance is not a passive resignation but an active recognition of limits, which enables man to face and transcend the magnificence of the flow of history.

### Poem by Goethe, Chosen by Spengler

In the realms of self-repeating flow  
for every springing meeting,  
hold yet the readiness to meet.  
Streams from all things love of living  
grandeurs at times and humblest crowd.  
All that striving is eternal peace in God.

**Translation:**

Likewise, each one is beholden to himself  
such wisdom will ever follow him  
that lovingly and confidently  
will strengthen every worthy thing  
and be true life's lustful action  
to the smallest as well as the greatest star  
and to all creatures, high or low  
is eternal rest in God, the Lord.
