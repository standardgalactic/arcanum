Spengler denied that history worked towards purposes certain by rational analysis. Progress is a causality imposed by the intellect, a reaction to the dual qualities of world-longing and world-fear resulting from man's relation as a microcosm toward an macrocosm—his knowledge of limits and the certainty of death.

On the other hand, history contains the problem of motion, the enigma of ever-unique experience, and the dilemma that forces man not only to observe movement in a scene but also to participate in that movement. This impossibility of ever observing what is in the process of observing itself leads to the inner experience of a destiny idea, which lives with absolute certainty by every individual of the early culture and whose beat decreases in the late Megalopolitan. Destiny represents eternal becoming, the intuitive answer to the question of when, the source, and resolution of all of man's hope, and the ultimate realization of inevitability.

Causality governs the become, with space as its representation. Becoming and being, Space and Time, Wisdom and Intellect, Freedom and Necessity constitute the true polarities of existence, giving rise to man's interpretation of existence either under the aspect of the World-as-History or the World-as-Nature.

Human progress has become equally meaningless, and instead, the shapes of great cultures emerge as carriers of all human meaning. Each culture is a product of its environment, awakening in moments when the fear of death and the longing for life synthesized into a vision of the world from which emerges the Grand Myth, the symbol embodying all problems and potentialities inherent to the soul. The inward representation of this massive entity is the culture's soul.

Each culture has a determined lifespan before returning to the biological ages that appeared in the shape of civilization, a state of absolute finality with its problems answered and style lost. Philosophy of history, according to Spengler, is not about industriously adding epochs or collecting data scientifically. Data provides only raw material, the condition for higher experience—a physiological tact that illuminates the meaning of symbols and explains stages of development. The morphology of history is Spengler's task, suited for a Western thinker. Cultures are compared in terms of their inner meanings, with contemporary epochs revealing functions at identical developmental stages.

Becoming and becoming, destiny and causality emerge as man's problems at every stage, permeating all his creations: art, the state, religion, economics, and natural science. At the end of this journey, while Caesarism rules in the Megalopolis and mankind's dilemmas are thought through to steely sharpness, there occurs a moment of realization that the analysis had not led to its goal—that man holds nothing but the early myth reshaped. At this point, a second religiosity envelops mankind, and creation in the grand style ceases across all fields of activity. Little civilization petrifies, entering an era of fate experienced as objects no longer felt.

Since destiny represents the will-to-live dependent on self-assurance for its expression, an analysis of the elements of political success ensues—not within a normative framework or purposive realization but as an answer to the pragmatic problem of prevailing.

Professor von Beckerath rejects Spengler's philosophy as a metaphysical creation not primarily based on empirically verified observations. The essence missed is not their empirical foundation but the adequacy of metaphysical concepts and their applicability to pervasive experiences, which must be the subject of analysis.

We must further decide how far Spengler follows Hegel despite his attacks on the assumption that rational purposes guide history and what his relation was to Darwin.



**Can the Components of Political Success be Described Without Normative Concepts?**

The final question arises: is it possible to describe the mere components of political success without imparting normative concepts into its evaluation? Can necessity serve as a guide for conduct, not merely as a description of completed action? The solution to these problems cannot be found by circling phenomena but only in personality; expressed philosophically by its metaphysical essence: omnia.

**2. Metaphysics**

"Regard the flowers at eventide, one after another, as they close in the setting sun. A strange feeling presses upon you—a feeling of enigmatic fear in the presence of this blind, dream-like earthbound existence. The still forest, the silent meadows, this bush, that twig do not stir themselves; it is the wind that plays with them. Only the little gnat is free—he dances still in the evening light, moving wherever he will.

'Servitude and Freedom—this, in the last and deepest analysis, distinguishes the vegetable from animal existence. Yet only the plant is entirely and wholly what it is; in the being of the animal, there is something dual. A vegetable is only a vegetable; an animal is a vegetable and something else besides. A herd that huddles together trembling in the presence of danger, a child who clings weeping to its mother, a man desperately striving to force his way into God—these are seeking to return from the life of freedom into the vegetable servitude from which they were emancipated into individuality and loneliness.

So begins Volume 2 of Spengler's *Decline of the West*, wherein is found the essence of his metaphysical doctrine. Everything existing contains something cosmic—the periodicity of the seasons, the rhythm of birth, life, and decay.

**Metaphysics in Animals**

Animals do not merely exist; they represent a unit that has separated itself from the All and can define its position in the world—around which it feels as environment. They are microcosms within a macrocosm. The cosmic possesses rhythm, tact, the grand harmony that binds together lovers or crowds in moments of absolute wordless understanding, the pulse that unites a sequence of generations into a meaningful whole. This is Destiny, the symbol of blood, sex, and duration. It answers the question of when and whether—providing the only method of approaching the problem of time. Great artists feel it during contemplation; statesmen embody it in action; it is lived by individuals in Springtime cultures.

**The Essence of Tragedy**

If this constitutes the essence of tragedy, it encapsulates the problem of "too late," when a relevant moment of the present is irrevocably consigned to the past. The microcosm contains tension and polarity—the loneliness of the individual in a world filled with strange significances, where the total-inner meaning of others remains an eternal riddle. Rhythm and tension, longing and fear characterize the relationship of the microcosm to the macrocosm."



Consciousness, or Being, represents a complex aspect of existence. In this framework, animals embody Waking-Being (Waking-Consciousness). However, only in sleep do all existences revert to mere Being.

For humans, waking-being is confined to the realm of sight—the eye. Sounds at night and the odors of flowers stimulate awareness in this world of light. Yet, concerning the world of sentience or the nature of butterflies with their crystalline eyes focusing on myriad possibilities—man knows little.
