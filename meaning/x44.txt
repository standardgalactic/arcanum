When creation has proceeded and found its institutional embodiment in the universal church, Palingenesis ensues—the absorption of a deeper meaning and the condition of advance. Each component of the disintegrating civilization develops a distinctive institution in response to the challenge of decline. The internal proletariat creates the Universal Church, while the dominant minority establishes the Universal State, and the external proletariat forms its ethnic war-bands.

Each institution allows for the evolution of both active and passive attitudes. Its monopoly of force enables the dominant minority to establish the universal state as a response to the challenge of internecine warfare among parochial states. Toynbee distinguishes three characteristic human types produced by this series: the conqueror, exemplified by Alexander; the hangman; and the statelite. The statelite exemplifies the tremendous increase in the state's power.

He applied the concept of a centralized Roman Empire that ought to have been achieved to restore order and clean up governance.



Socrates is reported to have said that history repeats itself, although not in the exact same manner. This concept applies to both individual lives and entire civilizations. For instance, after Alexander the Great's expansive conquests came the period of the Diadochi, followed by Roman dominance during the era of Hannibal. Similarly, after Pyrrhus' endeavors, Egypt experienced its own sequence of events.

The figure of the hangman emerges as a common symbol in declining civilizations, representing the oppressive actions of a dominant minority. This pattern can be seen from ancient times—such as Hellenic civilization under Titus, who persecuted the Christians—to more modern examples like the Nazis in Western civilization.

However, a universal state also yields different individuals. While its existence is fleeting, when a universal state reaches full bloom, it tends to develop administrators characterized by unselfishness and devotion to duty. These qualities often mask the inherent weaknesses of all institutions. This was evident in both the Roman and Chinese Empires during their respective zeniths.

In summary, history shows a cyclical pattern where periods of conflict are followed by phases of universal states, each producing unique figures whose roles highlight both strengths and vulnerabilities within civilizations.

The theme of this discussion focuses on societal changes during an Indian summer. Similarly, the changing century has placed the third world in a challenging position. This transformation has been characterized by both opportunities and exploitations associated with certain policies.

Historically, colonial administrations prioritized their interests over those of indigenous populations. The ethos of the administrator evolved from dominant minority perspectives. However, moving into the 20th century, there was at least lip service paid to the welfare of indigenous populations. This shift indicates a complex interplay between policy intentions and actual outcomes, reflecting broader societal changes.
