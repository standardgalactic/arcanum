Successful answers to these challenges result in overbalances, presenting new self-contained problems. This dynamic rhythm leads to growth through continuous problematization. A minority leads this process by guiding the uncreative majority through a blend of compulsion and inspiration. However, creativity risks becoming stagnant due to an idolatry of past successes.

The rise of activity is often countered by inertia and rule by force, creating divisions within society akin to schisms in religion from which a universal state emerges as an immediate solution. Yet, the success of this response can doom a civilization if it fails to renew itself through higher ideals or religions crafted on the ruins of collapsing states.

After periods of violent upheaval, a universal church may arise from the chaos, potentially giving birth to a new society through processes of appropriation and affiliation.

Toynbee's reliance on empirical surveys leads him into contradictions. An empiricist must validate normative concepts that history does not necessarily prove or establish universal rules for. The formulation of historical laws involves capturing necessity beyond mere purposiveness. Against the backdrop of twenty-one civilizations—either collapsed or showing signs of decay—Toynbee identifies a cycle of challenge and response, with doctrines emphasizing both internal dynamics (morality) and external conflicts.

This framework highlights that processes of withdrawal and return transform into self-regulation or inevitability, as civilizations rise and fall.



Bateson's work in mechanical description involves an empirical survey validating the tendency to consider mere surface phenomena as metaphorical rather than literal interpretations. He combines this with a comparative study of civilizations, proposing a framework where certain patterns are conceived. According to Bateson, there is an emphasis on the identification of philosophical and metaphysical resolutions through these studies.

Bateson compounds this by imposing a narrative pattern or structure for comparative study of civilization. All of which are conceptually intertwined within his framework. This approach challenges conventional views, encouraging deeper understanding beyond surface-level observations.



Officially, the local function operates in a manner that is both practical and theoretical. It serves as an operational framework for the practical application of platonic ideas into the history of our story's realm. These elements consist of both body and idea—an affirmation of their true fulfillment through the lens of human experience. 

It will be our task to analyze the validity of this concept at the causal level. This involves affirming the existence of all men as subjects within a framework that acknowledges both physical and metaphysical dimensions, aligning with the philosophical assertion of a holistic understanding of being.

In essence, our goal is to explore how these ideas manifest in reality and assess their coherence and applicability in explaining human experience and history.



The task is to find a measure for determining the extent of reality that can be ascribed to analogies between mythology and the New Testament. This exploration leads us to confront a fundamental enigma: Does history or life reveal a master-plan whose understanding provides a key to our dilemmas in apprehending what we observe? In doing so, we may discover insights into the mysteries on either side of our perception.

Can a metaphysical pattern be utilized in a 1:1 study that professes to find its proof in the first instance in empirical data, as postulated in Appendix A "The Concepts of Meaning"?

Every philosophy of history runs into the problem of what constitutes the motive force of directed life. Spengler opted for an organic interpretation that ruled all happenings. Toynbee could not accept this dilemma. He argued that life presents a series of challenges to which the response reveals personality and whose solution is therefore unpredictable. Yet, this assertion of freedom clashed with his empirical data that indicated almost certain decay for each civilization.

Toynbee tried to solve this difficulty by considering history as the realization of a divine plan in which "the needs of man are separate needs, each with its own destiny but all of one kind, and sown by the same Sower in the hope of attaining one harvest." Growth and decay merely present an underlying unity through which God reveals Himself to mankind. Like mountaintops offer an alternation of activity and decay, integration and differentiation. While events seem superficially recurrent, history actually operates in the fashion of a wheel, the recurring motion of which serves as the condition for progress.

Toynbee's metaphysical doctrine is nowhere explicitly stated.



To create a comprehensive presentation, I have utilized Dante's philosophy, which closely aligns with Toynbee's implied concept of civilization cycles and the idea of transfiguration—a key aspect of his cosmology.
