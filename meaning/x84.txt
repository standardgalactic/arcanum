In traditional propositional logic as explained in "Introduction to Logic" by Irving Copi, a judgment is considered a logical primitive. A judgment consists of distinguishing a particular element, the predicate, in the being of a subject that cannot be thought without entailing some other than the predicated character. The judgment contains two elements called terms: the subject-term and the predicate-term, joined by a copula always expressed by the word "is." For example, "dogs are things that bark" results from this definition of judgment as a condition in the being of a subject posited by the theory of existence.

The distinguishing characteristic of a judgment is its truth or falsity. As a point of fact, only true judgments matter because unless a man says what he does not really think, he declares the truth of his assertion. All judgments therefore imply affirming or denying a predicate of a subject and thus imply existence. This does not imply the reality of the grammatical subject but the existence of the world to which the judgment refers.

For instance, "Gryphons are fabulous monsters" does not affirm the existence of gryphons; however, it implies the concept of what is being discussed.



The view that reality is implied by every judgment, but ultimately represents the subject of every proposition, can be further explained through the concept of existential verbs like "to be," used as a copula.

Bosanquet carries this view to its ultimate conclusion. Reality is not only implied by each judgment but represents the ultimate subject of every proposition. The distinction between grammatical, logical, and ultimate subjects can be illustrated by the proposition: "Morphine dilates the heart." 

The grammatical subject here is "morphine." The logical subject can only be obtained through a series of interrogatives: "What dilates the heart?" resulting in "the heart" as the logical subject. "What do you know about morphine?" results in "morphine" as the logical subject. However, neither "Morphine" nor "dilates the heart" represents the ultimate subject. 

This ultimate cannot be understood by itself or even as a portion of reality. There exists only one real system to which all judgments refer.



To establish an object in this system as a requisite, we must linearly place it within the Spinozistic view that leads to denying the possibility of its pre-existence as part of anything greater or particular than the universe. This division of judgment into subject and predicate becomes meaningless because the whole predicate ultimately refers to reality. Thus, reality is implied by, not required for, meaningful statement.

Existence, therefore, concerns whether a term in the system denotes any actual presence within the universe it references. The division of judgment into subject and predicate-terms joined by a copula becomes meaningless and instead, the judgment as whole predicates ultimate reality. Hence, reality is implied by, not required for, a meaningful statement.

Existence pertains to terms implying qualities such as being or having certain properties. This perspective aligns with Spinoza's principles of logic, emphasizing that reality does not necessitate external existence but exists inherently within its own framework.



As 'the black horse' is an empirical entity, each judgment about it would have to be restated according to the speaker's vision. Traditional logicians (e.g., Bradley, Joseph, and Stabbings) find refuge in the Platonic concept of universals, which make the concept the only true reality.

Propositional logic is thus founded on concepts entirely metaphysical; from there, it proceeds to classify judgments according to certainty into categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive categories. According to quantity, propositions are classified as universal, enumerative, particular, or singular. They are also classified by quality (or modality) into assertoric, problematic, and apodictic (or necessary) judgments.

It becomes apparent that many of these sub-divisions are in turn metaphysical. Whether a judgment is universal or enumerative depends less on the inherent structure of the proposition than on the individual's theory of knowledge. Empiricists would deny any universal judgment, while Platonists would adhere to the possibility of universality even in statements such as "French ministers were invariably replaced." This could be related to the concept of 'Permanent Ministry.'

The evidence of a proposition constitutes a problem for epistemology, for which logic can supply no better clue than internal consistency tests. While judgments about truth cannot be defined solely by existence without consideration of conceivable non-existence.

Clean up the spelling mistakes and grammar: The black horse is an empirical entity; thus, each judgment about it would have to be restated according to the speaker's perspective. Traditional logicians like Bradley, Joseph, and Stabbings find refuge in the Platonic concept of universals, which they consider the only true reality.

Propositional logic is founded on metaphysical concepts and classifies judgments based on certainty into categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive categories. According to quantity, propositions are classified as universal, enumerative, particular, or singular. They are also categorized by quality (or modality) into assertoric, problematic, and apodictic (or necessary) judgments.

Many of these subdivisions are themselves metaphysical. Whether a judgment is universal or enumerative depends less on the inherent structure of the proposition than on an individual's theory of knowledge. Empiricists would deny any universal judgment, while Platonists might adhere to the possibility of universality even in statements like "French ministers were invariably replaced," potentially related to the concept of 'Permanent Ministry.'

The evidence supporting a proposition poses a problem for epistemology, one which logic can address only through internal consistency tests. Judgments about truth cannot be defined solely by existence without considering conceivable non-existence.



It's argued that entities can exist in a system of reality only if they can be conceived, as suggested by Joseph Griffin's view. This conception implies their existence, not just being Griffins. Thus, to ask whether their griffins exist is akin to asking whether anything existing has the nature intended by the term "Griffin." The entity assumed as the subject of discussion resembles Bradley's concept of Reality as the ultimate subject.
