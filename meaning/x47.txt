The concept of the "external proletariat" achieves permanence only after barbarian war bands accept the universal church, signifying a pivotal moment in history where gentleness triumphs over violence—the assault on peace through strife reveals deeper truths. This dynamic parallels the rise and fall of civilizations, as analyzed by Arnold Toynbee. His pragmatic method offers a valuable lens to understand how civilizations disintegrate through internal contradictions.

When an empire breaks down, it inevitably undergoes disintegration, where standardization becomes apparent. All such processes involve a dominant minority invading like barbarian war bands, leading to widening schisms and moral erosion. Faced with this dilemma, societies can respond violently or gently; yet gentle responses tend to foster creativity, holding potential for future growth.

The Universal Church embodies this creative potential, whereas the oppressive measures of universal states prove futile over time. Toynbee interprets Quaker pacifism not merely as a location-based movement but as a prudent policy. This approach highlights an inner attitude rather than mere physical presence in characterizing internal proletariat dynamics. Through his empirical lens, Toynbee identifies how Christianity's integration into decaying civilizations could signify both continuity and renewal, emphasizing the enduring impact of gentleness over oppression.

In summary, history reveals that peaceful responses to internal conflicts can lead to greater creativity and potential for a lasting legacy, epitomized by the Universal Church.



The essence of a Universal Church lies in its supra-mundane plane of reality, with its full meaning only realized after disintegration has run its course, and barbarian war bands have toppled the City of Destruction. Christianity could then become the chrysalis-in "bybee's" scheme—a new civilization. But its conception as the material salvation of the West is a very serious sin. 

Toynbee criticizes Athens for its idolization of an ephemeral civilization, which becomes apparent through the disintegration process. The mere description of institutional manifestations cannot exhaust the essence of this phenomenon. Just as growth reveals itself as a rhythm of progress and decay, responding to challenges and resulting in reconstruction, so too does disintegration hide a desperate moaning. The social schism represents merely a symptom of that profounder schism of the soul—indeed, the real cause of society's collapse.

The growth phase of civilization witnessed consistent development until it encountered its inherent challenges.



Directedness in all fields, behavior, feelings, and life is apparent. However, when integration becomes possible reactions polarize into inconclusive alternatives—a choice between active and passive options remains the only freedom left to a soul that has lost its creativeness. Such a soul participates either as villain or victim in social disintegration.

This aspect of Toynbee's philosophy results in an overall breakdown of his method. The state of a soul is approachable through empirical analysis only within its institutional embodiment. Interpretation of their inner meaning must remain a metaphysical construction. Attempts to derive historical law from a categorization of states of mind are ultimately unsuccessful. This theoretical viewpoint cannot claim to be merely a surface manifestation of phenomenal appearance.



The full implications of Toynbee's concept of "Promethean self-consciousness" involve understanding how humans, by becoming aware of their own creative potential, bear the immense responsibility of shaping history and society. This awareness entails a risk: if humanity fails to effectively harness this creative power for positive change, it risks falling into disintegration or fragmentation, akin to archaism or futurism gone awry.

Toynbee's analysis suggests that any conscious attempt to alter historical conditions must carefully navigate these challenges. Failure can lead to the penalty of societal breakdown and loss of integrity. This scenario echoes Hegel’s idea that "what is real is right," indicating that without transcending these dilemmas, humanity remains trapped in a cycle of freedom versus necessity.

The problem reflects an internal schism within the human soul—a creative force destroyed by its own actions, leading to inevitable collapse amidst nourishing frustration. Every aspect of this historical narrative highlights the profound challenges humans face when attempting to exercise their Promethean potential responsibly.

Ultimately, Toynbee's perspective reveals both the perils and profits inherent in self-consciousness. By understanding these dynamics, humanity might better navigate its complex journey through history.



Toynbee distinguishes several symptoms of inward frustration on the planes of behavior, feeling, and will. On the plane of behavior, the loss of creativity leads to alternatives of indulgence and self-control, each an attempt to coax nature into yielding its fruits. While minor efforts seek to recapture the charm of youth by giving rein to passions or their strict control, internal proletarians look for a substitute for the lack of leadership and direction. Their alternatives appear as patterns that are trite, lacking authenticity, and providing a shield from responsibility due to uncertainty.

On the plane of feeling, reactions occur across all levels, stemming from the loss of the Faustian elan by which growth had accomplished itself. These include a sense of ennui, a drift into apathy, and an overarching emotional inertia. The result is a pervasive malaise as certainty fades away.



A twentieth-century exhibit is the chrysalis passive era, where perception of change is in the air. The scene accentuates the impotence of man. When failure is a self-imposed inward subjugation relative to the mass sense or spirit, it becomes an admission of sin and appears as a refusal to recognize that one needs to clean up the act.



Get the conditions for salvation. The breakdown or growth is accompanied by a cessation of significant societal differences, which had persisted in such senses that it had made sense to produce forms that had been given by a civilized society and even civilization itself to a real style—a kind of productivity expressed in the blending of incompatible religions, energy, science, philosophy, laws, and a cosmopolitan ethos.



To those with profound souls, there lies a deep meaning in the loss of an ideal plan or unity behind the growth and decay of ephemeral phenomena. The idea of unity conjures a cosmos of eternal essence out of the chaotic appearances of the phenomenal world.
