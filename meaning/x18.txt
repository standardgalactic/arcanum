Of divine institution, the Magian soul first identified the story of the world with the history of Man into inexorable stages: world-beginning, world-development, and a world catastrophe. This framework contains the sanctification of the moral history of humanity.

The opus of ages and their actions are not only a testament to these effects but also an echo of divine authority. The process does not solely rely on any single event but unfolds through a succession that weaves together cosmic narratives with human experiences, shaping an intricate tapestry of existence.



Brother, all love, virtue, reality consist in participation in the divine pneuma. Man's reality consists of his participation in this divine life after its incarnation not only in souls but also in individuals, without any claim to reward for virtue. Man's reality is about actively participating in the divine spirit, working less on external rules and more through resignation and inner transformation.



The concept of "Magna Carta" can be related to Islam through the idea of "resignation." In Islamic theology, there are three emanations from God: God as the Creator, God as the Worker, and the Spirit of God. The consensus of the faithful, imbued with the Spirit or God, is considered beyond the possibility of deception. As Mohammed said, "People can never agree in error," explaining early church councils' decisions.

This concept transformed into a political one for limiting Papal power within Western interpretations of Magna Carta. In essence, it highlights the idea that divine truth and faith are immune to human error or deceit, similar to how Magna Carta served as a foundational document ensuring limits on authority.



Order represents the substantial infusion of the divine into scripture texts. This form of Revelation is the rule in the Magian religion. The only change that an imitable Koran passage can lead to is the development of exegesis and mystical meanings, the Halaka of which the Gospels in early Christianity and the Talmud of Judaism are examples.

It follows that a separation of church and state is impossible in the Magian culture. The consensus is its own church, its law in the sacred book as the only idea of nationality open to believers. A strong priesthood is also precluded. Man stands in direct relation to the divine so far as he participates in the profound and beyond that nothing avails. The true priest of the Magian culture is the hermit; the true bliss of its religion is ecstasy when the soul is at one with God, and the dark forces of materiality are defeated.

Yet until the coming of Islam, this Magian world had to live under the forms of the Classical, which it gradually infused with its own spirituality. The pillars of the temple occupied inside the mosque; a cupola replaced the flat roof, giving the impression of space but an enclosed space like a cave. A window in the roof lets dim light reflected from the gold-ground walls create an atmosphere of fairy-land unreality, the scene for the operation of an omnipotent ever-present deity.



Sophie, in her study at the Pantheon in Rome, contemplates a world akin to that of Spinoza. In his view, God's presence is immediate, with intuition serving as the sole criterion for knowledge. The geometric method represents merely a manifestation of Western Paedomorphism.

This world was known to Christ and poses challenges for understanding through a purely Christian lens. Since around 800 AD, after the Councils, this perspective has persisted in maintaining unchanging dogma while fostering creative interpretation.

Spengler's metaphors about the soul are deeply suggestive, resting on an intuition striving for absolute expression. His evocation of cultural souls can make abstract criticism appear dogmatic. One might question whether he describes tendencies rather than unchangeable relations. Achilles is not merely a body placed in a predetermined position; Homer does not assume consistency of personality. In fact, the essence of his tragedy lies in efforts to alter fate and accept one's limitations and mortality.

Polybius wrote a philosophy of history that compares favorably with many creations of the historical Faustian culture, sharing similarities with Spengler's concepts of gradual, inevitable degeneration. Spinoza may be a product of the Magian soul but was characterized by Froebel as a product of the Calvinist concept of predestination—a continuous God and an alliance with the "elect." The idea of a consensus might emanate from the Magian soul but not exclusively so. The history of the Law of Nature in Western philosophy demonstrates the pervasiveness of this concept, as seen in Rousseau's General Will.

The eloquence of these soul images cannot hide that alternative explanations of equal conviction are possible. This does not disprove Spengler's concepts but raises doubts about the exclusivity or development they constitute. Spengler considers the interrelation of cultures, for Paedomorphism, as only minimally important.

It was an accident that the Spaniards landed in Mexico, yet it was an inward necessity for the Maya Empire to collapse once it had reached its zenith. The adoption of Christianity by the West represents an incident—a symbol infused with specific God-imbued gravity. However, this strict separation seems untenable. It is hard to maintain that such a spiritual outpouring was not itself influenced by the forms it used. The superimposition of a ripe dogma about universal law on an essentially primitive community undoubtedly permeated its later history, which was significantly called "H" (History).



The Roman Empire's Germanic successor nations, as examined by Spengler, illustrate how language forms determine conceptions. The equation \(8 \times \frac{1}{2} = 4\) loses meaning unless expressed in words, highlighting the profound effect of transferring high legal traditions and philosophies on nascent cultures.

Similarly, the dynamic stage of each author seems to involve a radiation of influence across art, religion, and political forms over neighboring societies, as shown by Eduard Meyer and Toynbee. Conversely, border regions are never free from foreign influence, especially during periods of decline. The British influence on India has proved significant regardless of any adaptations that parliamentary government may eventually receive.

The infusion of new meaning into established forms cannot be equivalent to original creation. Spengler recognizes this, noting the effect of Christianity on a soul already predisposed to reverence. He laments the constraints imposed by Classical mathematics on Western science until Descartes expressed gratitude for the fortunate circumstances freeing Western painting from almost all classical fresco art. However, what does "fortunate" mean in such a context? Is it not an acknowledgment of the interrelatedness of cultures and an admission that certain forms persist, conditioning further developments?

Spengler fails to explain how the justification on facts of factor symmetry underlying symbols lies in any complexity or continuity of ideation.
