The title could be: "Philosophy Offers Little More Than Dialectic Underpinning for Church Doctrine"

The oppression experienced by both dominant minorities and internal proletarians is due to the emptiness in their souls, leading them inevitably toward a common religious experience. However, this identity of feeling cannot be sustained indefinitely. Philosophers often degenerate into mere superstition because their appeal targets the intellectual faculties exclusively.

The universal church maintains a depth of understanding that enables it to serve as the repository for all hopes and a herald for the fulfillment of our diverse civilization. 

Since Arnold J. Toynbee postulates alternative responses to the frustration caused by the unending cycle of feeling, reaction, and acting on behalf of these groups, there is an inherent tension between intellectual and spiritual approaches in addressing societal challenges. The universal church can offer hope where pure philosophy might fall short.



The task of saving humanity from destruction during these times of civilizational crisis is a mission of profound significance. The period demands an increase in spiritual acuity, as there exists a loss that cannot be compensated by mere material development and industrialization. Such progress may appear beneficial but often conceals the eternal truths lying just beneath the surface.

The first intuition of unity arises with the appearance of universal states. However, those who seek to unify mankind through force seal their own doom. The warfare plaguing nations must be addressed not by might, but by embracing a deeper spiritual vision that reveals the flickering phenomena as distractions from the eternal truth.

According to Arnold Toynbee in Volume VI, page 222, it is essential to look beyond transient conditions and strive for a genuine unity of spirit among all peoples. The challenge lies in recognizing the superficial allure of technological advancement while striving for a more profound connection that transcends material concerns.



Mill, Tarde, and Simmel have internally creatively theorized through text the persecution of its minorities. Its inner contradictions cause the term to collapse, a fate that befalls the entirety of the universe within our world. It ends by bringing to naught the apprehension of unity, which remains magnified in their narratives and expressions.

However, this perception does not withstand scrutiny, as the apparent unity is ultimately disrupted. These theories reveal the complex dynamics of societal structures, challenging the notion of a cohesive universal understanding.



The memories of being a child on the reservation have faded, but they linger in my mind's recesses, often surfacing when I'm at rest or pondering life. The stories told by elders painted vivid images of our people's past, blending reality with legend. These tales were more than mere entertainment; they encapsulated our communal spirit and belief systems.

In primitive societies, truth is revealed through the terrestrial plane, where man's striving for universality is expressed in solidarity with the tribal God on a supra-dimensional level. This connection reflects not just survival but an intertwined existence that honors both individuality and community.

Even if I cannot fully grasp these complexities, they resonate within me. As a child, my understanding was limited, yet I felt an intrinsic bond to the narratives shared by those around me. These stories were not only about our history but also about our identity as a people, rooted in traditions that transcend time.

As I reflect on those early days, I realize how much they have shaped who I am today. The wisdom of my ancestors continues to guide me, reminding me of the importance of staying connected to my roots while navigating the broader world.



The gradual realization of the importance of the celestial in strengthening one's connection to God was achieved through an initial oppressive situation that had been endured by tribes universally. This led to the transition from a tribal orientation to the recognition of individual significance, emphasizing personal spiritual experiences.



The challenge of creating a single, unifying civilization remains elusive despite humanity's technological advancements. Arnold J. Toynbee observed that although conditions do not currently support expectations for liberation from the tyranny of our era's fragmented existence, an apocalyptic vision sometimes emerges—a vision where divine judgment acts as a moral sanction over history.

In this perspective, when immediate action is insufficient to unify civilization, the idea of a transformative divine intervention gains appeal. This concept suggests that only through such ultimate judgment can true unity and liberation be achieved. Thus, while technological progress continues, the quest for universal harmony persists, highlighting an ongoing struggle between human efforts and the desire for transcendent solutions.

As history unfolds, these visions may not materialize as expected, but they underscore a deep-seated yearning for coherence in our collective existence—a reminder that unity often requires more than just technological or political advancements. It calls for a fundamental reevaluation of values and an alignment towards common goals.



The hopes that had been cherished were dashed, though ultimate unity remained a key concept permeating Universalist thought. The omnipotence of the ruler led to an extension of God's transcendence and the suspension of justice for the supremacy of Law. The dominant minority was acutely conscious of the potential power of law as not merely an administrative tool but also as a force in itself.

With the exaltation of Law, the personality of God progressively grew fainter. This was the condition during the Achaemenian Empire of Babylon and of Persia since the other representation of the universe's unity had been overshadowed.
