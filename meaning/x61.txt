The presentation of representative types in history serves as a method most applicable to comparative study. This explains Toynbee's approach to the New Testament and Mythology. As representations of objective occurrences, they contain not only analogies but also actual maxims derived from real events. For example, Eden represents an idealized state of innocence before change.



The activity that belongs to God is one of creation, manifesting in the perfection of the world. When no further outlet for His activity was available, it led to a supposed necessity for intervention by the Devil. This situation prompts Toynbee into extensive argumentation to prove the essential fairness of God's wager with the devil. Love must be considered an attribute of the universe and, consequently, a Divine attribute; its absence would indicate a deficiency in God. Christianity secures belief because God’s nature exhibits at least some semblance of consistency as Man does.

Yet, what is Toynbee really doing? He provides a mythic account that aims to escape the transitoriness of existence through eternal happiness. God obeys well-understood laws—of "fairness," of "consistency," and of "love." What do humans mean in such a context? Goethe said: "The noblest manifestation of mankind is shuddering awe." In contrast, Toynbee views the world as a machine capable of manipulation through knowledge of the levers of Challenge-and-Response. Mythology describes an inner state, not an active condition. It represents humanity's attempt to comprehend life and in that recognition, a necessity to express it.

Mythology expresses humanity’s hope and not its actual capacity. Man is a creative essence, not merely defined by material conditions. In a world of determined phenomena distinguished only by their measurable success as beacons or goals to achieve, a skeptic suggests to Don Quixote that perhaps his famous Dulcinea del Toboso does not really exist—he is perfectly aligned with the Kantian position of the categorical imperative: need and ought are different.



The text seems to revolve around a spiritual guide who serves not as a means to showcase prowess but rather as an embodiment of humanity's guiding light, similar to how Beatrice guides Dante in his most desperate moments. This figure offers comfort and direction during times of struggle, emphasizing the inherent worth and purpose of their guidance.

Here is a cleaned-up version:

The text discusses a spiritual guide whose role transcends mere demonstration of prowess but instead focuses on providing meaningful support and direction. Just as Beatrice guides Dante in his most desperate moments, this figure represents humanity's guiding light during challenging times. The emphasis is on the inherent worth and purpose of their guidance.

For poetry to truly be effective as a reality, it must describe that which man makes into an organic necessity—the essence of his moral permanence. Each individual has his Dulcinea or Beatrice and becomes a Don Quixote in the hopes of his creativity. Only he must learn that the Golden Age is not derived from the past but rather from within himself. It should be the soul's war against anything that inhibits its expression—not just in the first instance, but consistently.

Our aim is to clean up the language and ensure clarity while maintaining the original intent and meaning of the text.



The question posed here is about discerning why we have hope amid the certainty of death, even when the New Testament offers no causal proofs or prudent maxims—only an assurance in Immortal Tranquility. This tranquility underpins freedom and resides in a profound inward experience of life as a meaningful process full of alternatives.

Dante's "Divine Comedy," particularly Paradise Canto 3, suggests that every action reflects one's biography, yet remains irrevocable despite awareness of transience. Arnold Toynbee misinterprets the philosophical ideal of detachment. Detachment does not reject love but affirms an essential freedom from personal attachments. This stems from a conception of the moral personality as ultimate.

In this sentiment lies humanity's hope for self-realization—the possibility to transcend deterministic inevitability and phenomenological reality. It involves recognizing impermanence, acknowledging limits with humility before God, and embracing tolerance.



Toynbee's philosophy of history represents a conscious and vast effort to resolve the dilemmas of existence. He attempted to enhance the theme of human freedom by positing a pervasive purposefulness. However, his conflicting approaches make an evaluation very difficult. The assertion of purposiveness is negated by the conception of history as an evolutionary pattern in which survival constitutes the only test of inner truth. The theological basis results in imparting divine sanction into biological processes and leads to the cultural implication of failure as a sign of sin. At the end of the road, there is a transcendental transfiguration—a recognition of the super-mundane plane upon which Toynbee insists.

In contrast, Spengler had a vision of the world-as-experience "out of itself only the organic element." Toynbee saw in history much more than a machine but recognized theoretically the purposive factor. His failure arises from his attempt to look into the mere manifestations of history for a proof of their noumenal significance and from an effort to find a moral sanction in political events instead of turning to the realm of religion. The problem of necessity and freedom remains unresolved, though a way has been pointed along which these two realms can be reconciled.

If freedom is not an attribute of external, objective reality, it must result from an inward state that imposes its pattern on phenomena we find in our experiences. If morality is not denoted by ethical conduct alone, then two realms—freedom and necessity—are perhaps reconcilable through our experience of freedom within a determined mind. The meaning of history may appear as the emanation of moral personality. We have come to the problem of History and Man's Experience of Morality.
