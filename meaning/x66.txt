Kant's metaphysics, expanded in his "Critique of Practical Reason," serves as a basis for understanding his philosophy. Here, he addresses the compatibility of free will and natural law, suggesting that freedom is found in moral autonomy rather than physical determinism. This autonomy allows individuals to act according to universalizable maxims, bridging the gap between necessity and freedom.

In summary, Kant's philosophical framework posits that while the laws of nature govern the external world, human beings possess an inner realm where moral decisions are made freely. This duality underscores his belief in the transcendental freedom essential for ethical action.



The central problem lies in reconciling the transcendental experience of freedom by reflecting on the metaphysical presuppositions underlying rational thought. This issue arose because reducing freedom to empirical experiences made prior judgments impossible, as they were a priori and not based on experience.

Empiricists approached morality as an analysis of pleasing perceptions of benevolence or utility, but their synthetic judgments were posteriori and denied the possibility of universal validity. Yet, experience without concepts is blind, and concepts without precepts are meaningless. 

Kant resolved this dilemma with what he termed his "Copernican Revolution." Perhaps the problem of how to achieve a relationship between ideas and external reality, which had led Descartes and Spinoza to invoke God as the connecting link (one in terms of guaranteed reliability and the other in terms of all-pervasiveness), was so intractable because its basic epistemological assumptions were incorrectly stated. Just as Copernicus, when he could not account for certain celestial phenomena with the existing formula for revolution, finally assumed a radical revision of this formula—Kant suggested that instead of assuming our knowledge must conform to objects, we should consider how objects conform to our knowledge. This shift allowed Kant to bridge the gap between concepts and experiences, ensuring meaningful engagement with reality while maintaining freedom in thought.



The dilemma concerning how an abstract mind can relate to external reality is a central theme in Kantian philosophy. The question arises about what it implies for the mind to conform to concrete, external reality.

Immanuel Kant revolutionized metaphysics by suggesting that instead of the mind conforming to external reality, physical objects can only be understood if they conform to certain patterns and structures within our own perceptions. However, he also posited that ultimate reality—in its entirety—can never be fully comprehended. Human knowledge extends only as far as phenomena in sensory experience, and thus, ultimate realities—the things-in-themselves—are not disclosed to the cognitive faculties.

If this is true, then Critical Philosophy analyses by defining the limits of our understanding through an inherent critique of reason. It suggests that while we can know appearances (phenomena), we cannot have direct knowledge of things as they are in themselves (noumena). This distinction underscores Kant's argument that while we engage with and understand the world, there remains an aspect of reality beyond human cognition.



On the structure and form of synthetic judgments a priori, it is evident that these judgments state nothing less than that all phenomenal experience must conform to certain patterns. The constitution of the human mind prevents cognition in any other context. 

The distinction between reality into phenomenal (apprehended by pure reason) and noumenal (things-in-themselves and as such the object of speculative reason) does not, however, mean that knowledge of noumenal reality is impossible. Though pure reason is confined to phenomenal appearances, the noumena may reveal themselves through an inward experience.

The realm of necessity encompasses freedom insofar as our understanding of noumenal truths can be accessed internally, beyond empirical observation.



It appears as if Kant aims to connect knowledge with belief, thus establishing the possibility of purposeful morality in the world or determined causality.

The validity of Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason* depends on his analysis of the framework within which phenomenal experience occurs. Time and space, in this sense, are not empirical entities nor properties of objects but patterns imposed by our minds to refer experiences to objects outside ourselves. The non-existence of space cannot even be imagined, though space without objects to fill it is conceivable. Similarly, substance poses a category for phenomena, imposed unless by the mind to provide permanence in you; otherwise, each modification would involve a new object. 

Causality, again, reveals the condition which establishes the difference between objective and subjective cognition.



The interplay between perception and imagination is crucial in understanding how events occur in a certain order. When an event occurs, the mind attempts to reverse this sequence through an effort of will. If it fails, the objective reality of the experience becomes accepted for causal analysis.

Kant transcended Hume's skepticism by limiting human knowledge to the world of natural occurrences, which are forced into patterns by pure reason. He acknowledged, however, that the phenomenal world may only represent an inadequate portion of reality—the further reaches of which can never be fully apprehended through pure reason but extend beyond spatial and temporal bounds.

Kant's general approach as an exhaustive analysis is significant in this context. It emphasizes not merely theoretical knowledge but also practical reason, suggesting potential for what lies beyond our direct perception and understanding.



Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" concludes with a series of antinomies related to concepts such as the finite and infinite, freedom and God versus causality. The question arises of how one can speak of human freedom in a world where every event has a cause.

Kant resolves this apparent contradiction by invoking his earlier distinction between phenomenal and noumenal reality. If the total reality is the phenomenal world, then indeed all freedom would be an illusion. However, if there exists another realm beyond the phenomenal—a noumenal domain—then as far as man is noumenal (a thing in itself), he may achieve freedom, even though, as a physical phenomenon, he remains subject to phenomenal requirements.
