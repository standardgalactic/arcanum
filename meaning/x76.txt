Yet this judgment limits itself to attributing intrinsic purposes; the embodiment of such in apparent purposes remains a mystery. Any explanation of incidental appearances through teleology seeks the underlying unity of organic growth. 

The consistency of Kant's philosophy becomes extrinsic even as he argues that since humans are the only creatures capable of forming an idea of teleology, they are also the final purpose of the universe. Yet this again assumes a personal.

Kant makes a distinction between purposiveness and purposes between an intrinsic and an external teleology: 

"We can see that external purposiveness can be regarded as an external natural purpose only under the condition that the existence of that being to which it is immediately or distantly advantageous is itself a purpose of nature."



Since it can never be completely determined by mere contemplation of nature, it follows that relative purposes seem necessary. Although it hypothetically gives indications of natural purposes, it justifies no absolute teleological judgment.

Snow in cold countries protects the crops from frost and makes human intercourse easier by means of sleds. (Here follows an enumeration of conditions that make existence in such regions possible.) Here is a wonderful concurrence of many references to one purpose… But then we do not see why generally men must live there at all. To say that vapor falls out of the atmosphere in the form of snow, that the sea has its currents which float down the moor which has grown in warmer lands, and that there are great sea monsters filled with oil because the idea of advantage for certain poor creatures is fundamental to the cause that collects all these natural products would be a very venturesome and arbitrary judgment.

It is interesting to note that despite this refutation, Kant uses almost exactly the same argument in his "Perpetual Peace" (see Friedrich op. cit., p. 449 et seq.). Note also the reference to Spencer as a morphologist. Bernard op. cit., p. 361 et seq.

Experience cannot provide an objective principle of reality. While we can form a conception of purposes, Kant himself has denied the recognition of this super-sensuous world-order from the experience of freedom.

The objective mode of operation of phenomena must therefore remain undetermined. If man's purposes are equated with nature's purposiveness, the ethical and the natural become identical, and freedom emerges as but a mode of causality. Every event is both an effect and an inward experience. As an effect, it is subject to causal analysis and to a teleological judgment which postulates an intrinsic purposefulness. As an experience, it reveals man's personality and constitutes the means for transcending the necessity of the phenomenal world.

The experience of freedom requires man to give his own meaning to his particular existence. If a transcendental vision guides the quest for the purpose of existence, phenomena can offer no further guarantee; the empirical world no permanent oasis. If man’s essence consists in the ability to act purposefully out of conception of duty, then empirical reality furnishes at best a challenge, never a condition.

The sublimity of the moral law, which Kant felt at its operation within him, involves a task for which we cannot write all assurance of success or of the following of events. Anyone who...



This text explores how one's understanding of history can shape their perspective, particularly in a way that is optimistic about human freedom and potential. It suggests that such an outlook derives from a mystical relationship with the infinite, constrained even by categorical imperatives—principles derived from reason.

The analysis implies that interpreting history meaningfully requires evaluating specific conditions without relying on any transcendent guiding principles. Thus, alternative hypotheses could dominate interpretations in their absence. Toynbee's philosophy, building upon Kant’s ninth principle of "Idea for a Universal History," highlights the futility of such an attempt.

Kant argues effectively only when his teleological judgment (judgment about purpose and meaning) is informed by transcendent experience. This includes understanding humanity's journey through history as guided by a categorical imperative that enlightens this path. The notion posits that while human experiences are personal, they do not inherently account for the essential line of humankind or its fate.

However, it also suggests the possibility of recognizing individual dignity and purpose. Each person’s will can contribute universal maxims that add depth to their existence and history. In summary, the text intertwines philosophical perspectives on how individuals relate to historical meaning and human freedom.



**Office as a Specimen in a Determined System**

In this essay, I aim to explore office not merely as an isolated element but as a specimen within a broader determined system, aligning with the norms that humans set for themselves. This perspective allows us to understand humanity's role and meaning within the inexorable flow of events. The categorical imperatives enable the reconciliation of conflicts and promote a lasting peace in line with human aspirations.

Kant had an extraordinary intuition regarding the world as both design and phenomenon. In his works, he combined profound metaphysics with moral philosophy to reconcile personal experience with universal applicability. He integrated knowledge and belief, facilitating experiences that elevate humanity beyond the deterministic universe of phenomena into a relationship with a supersensuous world order. History reveals a task for achieving eternal peace as envisioned by the moral law, eliminating any conflict between theory and practice.

Kant's attempt to expand his philosophy of history into a guarantee for attaining the moral law failed for similar reasons that Toynbee's "The Remnant of Freedom and Necessity" could not be reconciled solely through external experience. The mechanism of nature provides no apparent assurance for implementing freedom, as identifying the ethical with the natural assigns meaning to history only when such volition is seen as a tool for organic necessity.

Nevertheless, Kant's philosophy points toward the coexistence of experience with our knowledge of necessity and freedom. This transcendental experience challenges the mechanistic view of nature, suggesting that the perceived smallness of this experience provides norms that overcome necessity through purposeful striving. However, two problems remain unresolved: What is the nature of this mysterious relationship to the Infinite? If reconciliation with the purposes of the Universe informs ethical activity, what connection exists between our subjective and objective experiences?

The subsequent chapter titled "The Sense of Responsibility" will attempt to address these issues.
