#### The Paradox of Irrevocable Action

Human experience often involves making decisions with a strong sense of choice, suggesting an internal conviction of free will. Yet, these choices frequently lead to unforeseen or disproportionate outcomes. This paradox raises questions about the nature of causality when it appears to operate under conditions of freedom.

The philosophy of history delves into these problems by exploring humanity's quest for understanding life’s purpose and the existential questions that underpin our existence. It merges with metaphysics, aiming to interpret historical events in a broader, often profound context. This intersection challenges us to reconsider how we classify philosophical theories of history beyond simple cyclic or progressive models.

#### Philosophical Interpretations

- **Cyclical vs. Progressive Theories**: Traditional classifications divide philosophies into cyclical and progressive narratives. However, this distinction is insufficient for capturing the complexities involved. For instance:
  - Toynbee merges both concepts.
  - Spengler’s views align with cyclical traditions like those of Vico.
  - Kant presents a theory of progress achieved through conflict, akin to Toynbee's perspective.

#### Can History Provide Meaning?

The next section explores whether history can genuinely provide answers to these existential questions. Poppers' perspective suggests that history, in its raw form, lacks inherent meaning—it is marked by international crime and suffering. Yet, it falls upon us to imbue history with significance by supporting the triumph of open societies over closed ones.

In summary, while historical events themselves may not offer direct answers to philosophical dilemmas about freedom and determinism, they prompt deeper inquiries into how we derive meaning from our collective past.



The passage discusses a contradiction within an argument about whether history has meaning. If history lacks meaning, then the eternal conflict between freedom, rationality, mysticism, historicism, and tyranny cannot be its motif. This situation illustrates the inherent difficulty and confusion in defining "meaning." The implications of this dilemma are threefold:

1. History has no meaning.
2. History does have a meaning, but it is unacceptable to Popper.
3. History lacks meaning until freedom and rationality triumph, at which point it gains content.

This introduces the core question: Is history an open book that contains all of mankind's aspirations and the world's purpose? Or does history present a series of meaningless incidents that challenge our nominal concepts, gaining significance only through conformity?

Logical positivists accept the first alternative, arguing that meaning results from verifying statements with empirical facts. However, anthropologists have contested this by suggesting that culture-specific meanings can be more firmly grounded in the physical world as their criterion. It has been demonstrated that each culture and individual constructs its own image of "reality," and facts are not absolute or unshakable.

Moreover, modern physics presents a reality composed of mysterious and incompatible primary data, such as light behaving both as a wave and a particle (the photon). Consequently, classical logic recognizes that not only value judgments but all qualitative judgments are meaningless; the difference between affirming an object's worth or its color is a matter of achieving consensus, not empirical verifiability.

Intensional logic, which considers each proposition to relate to ultimate reality, was more aware of this problem. A judgment, expressed in words through propositions, involves the activity of a particular element within a subject that cannot be thought about unless it contains meaning.

For a full discussion on the concept of "meaning," see Postscript Appendix A: "The Concept of Meaning."



The distinguishing characteristic of a judgment is its truth or falsity. However, only true judgments matter because asserting something one does not truly believe implies affirming the truth of that assertion. Thus, all propositions imply existence, even though reality itself is not required for judgments.

The existential import theory of propositions encountered several difficulties. Logicians argued that statements about mutually exclusive terms, such as a square circle, did not imply existence. Additionally, logical constructions only having a mode of being without real existence complicated the reconciliation of definitive reality with all possible judgments.

Sentential logic abandoned the concept of the existential import of propositions. Its logical primitive is a sentence, which groups symbols in general categorical terms representing complete entities. These sentences acquire meaning only when related to other objective facts or objects. Since determining truth and falsity does not predetermine every statement, sentential logic invoked another predicate of propositions: truth-weight. This is a purely psychological relation.

However, this theory faced the problem of defining what constituted a fact and reconciling truth-value with weight. In his later writings, Bertrand Russell addressed these issues, refining the understanding of how sentences relate to facts and the nature of truth within logical systems.
