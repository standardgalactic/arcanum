retrospect appe�r inevitable, the fnct of occurrence testi￾fies to irre,,ocnbili ty. Causality expresses the p2ttern which 
the mind imposes on n soquonce of events in order to make the ir 
eppearBnce comprehensible. It is formulated as s lnTI, which

Luw ever fights 3gainst the unique, ngainst the personal ex￾perience., the inward bliss. Necessity recognizes only quantita￾tive differences, and conceives o.f survival RS its sole test of 
historical .fitness. Necessity discovers the typical in man, 
the inexorable in e vents, the inevitable in existence. Its doc￾trine is the philosophy of 'Eternal Recurrence of which the devil

The limits of thought can not be establiohed by
