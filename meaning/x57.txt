Again, Toynbee considers the sudden decrease in cultivation and prosperity upon crossing the German-Lithuanian frontier as evidence of excessive climate conditions affecting development.



The very occurrence of an abrupt transformation should have cautioned Toynbee against positing cyclic change as the key factor in historical development. However, an examination of history will disclose a variety of reasons for the deficiency in economic development of this border region between Catholic and Orthodox Christianity, the West and the Slav. Yet much a single-factor analysis is the logical consequence of the application of the methods of natural science to historical phenomena. Historical events represent liquid occurrences, products of the interplay of creative personalities and an organic environment to be analyzed causally only in their respective perspectives. Though Toynbee realized this in theory, his practice has ever been on a quest for the apprehension of immutable laws, of which his law of Race or Law of Compensation furnish high-level examples.

For Toynbee, every event is viewed as meaningful within a broader historical context, but such an interpretation often overlooks the complex and multifaceted nature of societal development.



The tendency to consider all manifestations comparable leads us to overlook the mere possibility of unpredictability in events. However, comparability for natural science implies qualitative equivalence, meaning only quantitative differences exist. This perspective can lead to a superficial classification that draws conclusions from surface phenomena.

For instance, because universal states preceded disintegration in most civilizations, each appearance of an inclusive political organization heralds the breakdown of its society. The Roman Empire's fall represents as certain a criterion for the decline of Hellenic civilization as Augustine’s creation does for the impending disintegration of Hebraic civilization. Similarly, Mughal Emperor Akbar's introduction of the Western alphabet, Hitler's abolition of the lunar calendar system, the administrative reforms of the French Revolution, and Peter the Great's political creation are all considered equivalent developments with similar doomed fates.

Since each disintegrating society has an external proletariat, all attacks from beyond a civilization’s borders must fit this category. For example, the Sassanid Empire’s onslaught on declining Byzantine is paralleled by increased warfare in the Russian forest between the Khazar Empire and Scandinavian warbands. Additionally, the "gentle" external action proposed as Italy’s position is related to it being an external proletariat, as noted by Toynbee.



The work by Osservatore Romano on volume VI, page 288 discusses an aspect of Iran's political landscape. It addresses how Persian influences interact with Islamic elements within the country. The argument suggests a commonality between civilizational structures across different orders and groups in Iran.

The discussion points to specific features such as institutionalization present in both religious and secular orders. This analysis aims to demonstrate that despite differences, there are overarching themes of organization that permeate Iranian society.



Here's a revised version with improved spelling, grammar, and clarity:

The range of endurable challenges that Toynbee addresses highlights his ability to make qualitative distinctions. He refutes the theory of the excessive nature of the Roman challenge by emphasizing its Hellenic origin. 

Similarly, the impact or Rome on Celtic civilization occurred at the height of Roman power, aided by the proximity of the Po Valley to the centers of its strength. It is at least debatable whether the Teutons could have successfully resisted the Roman challenge under comparable conditions.

The only connection between these challenges lies in their Hellenic origin. The impact or Rome on the Celts occurred when Roman power was at its peak, aided by geographical proximity. Similarly, it remains debatable if the Teutons could have withstood a similar challenge from Rome. 

Despite setbacks such as Jewish and Zoroastrian revolts, the Roman intrusion into Syriac civilization persisted due to its Hellenic roots.



It seems that during an earlier stage of their development, Judaism took on a significant role within Zoroastrianism. Moreover, Islam later represented the response to Roman stimuli. However, Toynbee's theory about their empirical origin in Christianity and its magnitude allows him to consider their unique challenges.

This version corrects spelling mistakes and removes unnecessary notes and numbers for clarity.



The text discusses concerns about certain actions that might only be understood by those familiar with specific codes, possibly hinting at secretive or exclusive practices. It highlights a potential threat to the occupation of an area, posing significant challenges. The mention of barbarian customs suggests cultural conflicts or clashes. Preventative measures are being considered to avoid undesirable occurrences.

There is also reference to political actions and responses, implying that these issues have broader implications and may require strategic thinking and planning. Examples are used to illustrate key points, and a "gentle" response might be advocated as a strategy for addressing the situation. Overall, the text deals with complex socio-political dynamics requiring careful navigation.
