Poetry is not merely a form of entertainment; it can also be seen as a vehicle for philosophical thought and expression. However, some critics argue that poetry does not offer the kind of objective analysis found in other forms of literature, such as novels or plays.

For instance, consider the progression from Homer to Virgil, Dante, and Milton. This evolution reflects an expansion in the concept of freedom. In Homer's "Iliad," there is a sense of blind necessity—events unfold with little regard for human agency. However, in "The Odyssey," this necessity gives way to a space for human striving and perseverance, as exemplified by Odysseus' determination to return to Ithaca.

In Virgil's works, we find an exploration of moral satisfaction and a shift in the concept of arête from outward distinction to inward grace. Yet, even here, there is no clear resolution or certainty. The freedom achieved through submission to objective necessity can feel oppressive. Virgil searches for a deeper sense of moral sanction.

This progression highlights how the understanding of freedom evolves, moving away from mere acceptance of fate towards an exploration of human will and morality within their environment. In this context, poetry offers a unique lens through which we can explore these complex themes.



Augustan Empire with its wide vanguard is also a testimony to his loneliness in a valueless world. Dante removes all doubts by attributing a divine nature to necessity and alleviates Virgil's sorrow by the bliss of absolute knowledge. In Milton, freedom is completely interiorized; necessity no longer requires dogmatic buttressing. Justification affirms the intrinsic worth of the individual.

This gradual enlargement of concepts through the internalization of a moral code culminates in the supremacy of individual conscience, which represents only one aspect of humanity's hope. However, life seems to involve death, both in history and individually. Though aging in a culture is not analogous to physical decay, it bears a similarity to another problem of existence: the process of disenchantment.

Just as the life of the world, every person's story reveals its own form of increasing familiarity with all struggles; an eager quest for a guarantee of man’s hopes.



In Homer and Dante, the mystery of growth remains noticeable. The enchantment with beauty, the fresh exultation at creativity and expression, prevails as they live in harmony with nature—the glittering sun on leaves, the beating waves against rocks—not yet so familiar to be commonplace nor so remote as to offer a vision of peace denied by the turbulence of the soul. Their world appears as a possibility through a reconciliation of will with necessity—blindly striving in Homer, blissfully certain in Dante.

On the other hand, Virgil and Milton are both full of inward doubts. They are both Protestant in that their moral standards frequently clash with historical realities. The mystery of life has been dispelled, leaving only struggle remaining. Their concern is with a scriptural or material order where wealth itself becomes evil, and Milton's Adam falls because carnal pleasures are intrinsically sinful. Romantic longing appears as an attempt to find solace in nature from the uncertainties of existence.

The vision of a Golden Age, like Rousseau's over the fleetingness of perfection that it will ever after be mankind’s task to reach, contrasts with the greater delusion—whether it is the belief in infinite material progress. As even an inwardly remote enchantment of nature dissipates and cold materialistic intellect replaces romantic sentimentality, life emerges as merely a technical problem. The frantic search for social solutions or economic panaceas testifies to the emptiness of a soul where necessity is seen as an objective state, not an inward condition. Those who believe that just a little more knowledge or one more formula will solve the increasing bafflement of a materialistic environment are mistaken.



Forsake that matter, CB! It is great only for those who have no spirituality to impart to it. Freedom invariably involves the recognition of limits and the acceptance of one's humanity. But the moral content of ethical freedom resides in the manner of acknowledgment. The meaning given to necessity reveals a gradual process of disenchantment but does not negate the ultimate conception of morality deriving from a mystic relationship with the Infinite.

Homer envisioned life as the inevitable unfolding of a pre-ordained fate. The threads of Tyche move all creation, men as well as gods. In the Iliad, Zeus holds up the cases of Sarpedon and Hector (as much as that of Achilles) to represent man's rebellion at the inevitability of existence. There is an important difference: Zeus has achieved his limit in accepting that there is no escaping Fate, and he abides by its decision.

Achilles, on the other hand, embodies a lament over the brevity of life, symbolizing an assertion of mastery over Fate or an attempt to wrest consolation for one's mortality. But seeking to escape objective necessity involves certain tragedy—to fail to accept limits characterizes the madness that equates man with God.

Man's triumph does not lie in a physical conquest of objective necessity. Achilles transcends necessity only through an inward skepticism, rising above the unimportant eternal issue of a short and heroic or long and commonplace life. He had been the prisoner of a prophecy, but with his recognition of limits, he has achieved freedom where meaning lies no longer depends on external conditions.

This explains in general the unique quality of the character of Achilles—a man who, having cleansed himself from external constraints, finds true freedom and purpose.



The blend of character and fate in representative types illustrates a meaningful exploration in literature where both elements interact dynamically. In such narratives, focusing solely on one aspect—either character or fate—is reductive.

Freedom represents the indefinable quality that resists Theodorus's (assuming this refers to a figure symbolizing inevitability) inexorability and is expressed by the interplay of internal desires and external circumstances. This dynamic allows for the comparison of men and their interactions with things, emphasizing how characters navigate fate while retaining agency.

Ultimately, these stories challenge the notion that individuals are mere subjects to destiny, highlighting instead a complex relationship where both character and circumstance shape outcomes.
