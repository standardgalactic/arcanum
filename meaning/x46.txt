On a global plane, Western disintegration is often seen as a region in decline rather than an indication of Indian terms inclusion. It signifies the end of Western Civilization.

This period saw peasant and Anabaptist revolts emerge in the West. However, these movements were not simply acts of resistance but also reflected broader social dynamics and transformations within European societies.



It's a gentle, subtle art exhibiting a prodigious nature that is not faced with the crucial dilemma of its existence. It must either take to heart the hopes of the masses for the satisfaction of immediate political aims or whether to confine itself to the satisfaction of greater spiritual wants.

The future such as it is—still in the making—is part and parcel of a broader cultural discourse. 

This finality, however, lies not in the immediate but rather in its nuanced ability to influence and inspire over time.



The level of the trader's challenge is high. All his reconciliation and reprisal ensured the eventual triumph of Christianity. However, Jewish survival was not assured until the realization that the state of the Kingdom from all of God's tenets was not a temporal testament but an eternal "state."

The spiritual superiority of the eternal proletariat over the dominant minority becomes apparent in their comparative international establishments. The Universal State is a child born of reconciliation, just as the universal church exhibits an elevated level of inner unity. This gentle response from the dominant minority ensures their survival in oblivion. 

Both philosophical and religious deities are treated with respect, avoiding any approach that could be considered profane or idolatrous. Each reaches out to their adherents as a religion, detached from any tangible material substance.



Toynbee identifies many symptoms of disintegration in Western civilization. The dominant minority has no solution to the problem of internal warfare among parties, the increasing violence of which multiplies tension within society. This leads to a re-emerging theology and traditional adoration.

The internal proletariat, after its unsuccessful attempt at violence during the Peasants' Revolt, has learned gentleness from groups like the Quakers. The Quakers illustrated their prosperity by demonstrating that "the meek shall inherit the earth," which is considered a wise policy. Meanwhile, the violence of capitalism has softened until it transforms into a dominant minority's totalistic worship of the state. However, Christianity represents the deepest manifestation of Western gentleness. In races only a generation removed from slavery, Christianity has been revitalized and become a living force. The grip of non-pagan dominance is visibly lessening, and hope flows anew through the branches of Western Christendom.

Toynbee expressed belief that this tottering civilization, intoxicated by its victory over physical nature, could find peace through the external proletariat's self-constitution in response to the flagging inspiration of the civilisation. During the growth phase, barbarian mimicry was directed towards the creative minority’s cultural achievements. The area of contact between the two societies had been fluid, with the extent of cultural radiation determined by the civilization’s inner energy. However, the emergence of the dominant minority has led to a secession from these values.



The barbarians who now form the external proletariat face a fixed boundary with their antagonists across a tenuous truce before inevitable conflict. The external proletariat may continue to adopt civilization's superior techniques, but the inner relationship has ceased, leading to unavoidable climax. Unlike the internal proletariat, which is under the dominant minority's direct control, the external proletariat possesses effective means of physical resistance. Moreover, while the dominant minority is exposed to all elements of creativity, the external proletariat gains strength from an ever-increasing number of barbarians.

Violence, therefore, becomes the most typical reaction of the external proletariat. Its institutional embodiment are the barbarian war bands, whose penetration into civilization's territory heralds the beginning of the interregnum. The external proletariat's religion reflects its changed outlook. Defense or protection is of utmost importance at this stage, so the God of fertility constitutes the primary religious focus in early development stages. However, with the emergence of a military frontier, social revolution occurs. The community's energies are then directed towards conquest and conversion to the destructive activities' relative impotency. The God of war appears as the Divinity toward which the worship of the external proletariat begins to be directed, testifying to its choice of the attitude of violence.

Even this period is not without its creativeness, however. Homer's epic poetry, for example, emerges in this time, reflecting some level of artistic and cultural development despite the overarching theme of conflict and resistance.
