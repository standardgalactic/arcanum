The metaphysical opposition between becoming and being, and the assertion of the ultimate supremacy of Time over Space, form the basis of Spengler's political theory. Just as a developing organism characterized by gradual growth and dominance of certain organs constitutes an organic whole doomed to self-destruction, politics exhibits an eternal conflict between blood (race aspect) and concept, tradition and dogma.

The decline of Culture is accompanied by the decline of those political forms that signify a mature organism. Interest replaces earlier subordination to an all-idea, and money supplants tradition as the motivating force. At each stage, however, the racial aspect of life triumphs over its causal representation: first in the victory of economics over abstract political systems and finally in the emergence of naked power in Caesarism.

Spengler considers politics as the essence of life, manifested in a will for survival. Its criterion is self-assurance, whereby war becomes an integral element.

And only peace the choice between victory and ruin, not merely distinguishes two aspects in the destiny side of life, the preserving and the metering. They are symbolized by the separation of the sexes. The woman represents the life of the race; the man makes history. The woman accepts with difficulty that other history which takes her sons from her, while the man ever experiences a conflict or duties between the public and private manifestations of being.

This duality of the sword and spindle side of being—state or family—forms an era's directional time. Property, too, as a trait of race belonging to History, is reduced to a concept only with the advent of the Cosmosopolis. It exhibits this duality in the twin attributes of possession: Having as power and having as booty. From the feeling of power stems conquest, politics, and law; from that of booty derives trade, spoil, and money. This explains the peril of civilizing money as a dogma but the essence of tutelage.

**Tutor**

The tutor, an entity or concept embodying knowledge and guidance, emerges at this juncture to navigate these complexities, balancing personal influence with societal expectations.



A nation's moral and political struggle often heralds a decline in political vitality. Spengler argues that all successes in history, whether through war or politics as a continuation of war by other means, have been the product of units that surround themselves with "form." A being is "in form" in the same sense as used in sports: when athletes are in form, the ease of their performance hides the difficulty of their acts. A style that has become second nature signifies an art period "in form."

A political unit is in condition when its tradition breeds a high overall engagement, allowing it to dispense with the great men whose accidental appearance frequently does more harm than good by the voids their absence leaves in the flow of events.

### The Components of a Culture

A culture forms as a people grow into a great nation, gaining influence over other peoples. A polity exists as a "State," representing its history at rest. Simply belonging to time does not suffice; mere descriptions of constitutions and privileges cannot explain the essence of a state. Its real existence lies in conventions and practices that are often silent because they are taken for granted.

### World History According to Spengler

For Oswald Spengler, world history is state-history rather than class-history. Political leadership always belongs to a small aristocracy possessing an instinct for teamwork and representing the nation in existential struggles. The more naturally the internal arrangements of the state develop, the surer they adapt themselves to crises.

### National Unity and Management

The inner constitution of a nation must always be ready for conflict, involving the management of internal opposition by the ruling stratum in such a way that the energies of the nation do not exhaust themselves in party conflicts. Treason should never be thought of as a last resort. Foreign policy is the ultimate criterion of domestic fitness.

### The Dual Aspect of Destiny

The destiny idea encompasses both private and public aspects, emphasizing the importance of unity and preparedness in facing external challenges while maintaining internal harmony.
