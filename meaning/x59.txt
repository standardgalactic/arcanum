Toynbee's actual analysis defines the response exclusively in terms of challenge. This constitutes a rebuttal to any theory that assumes topographical and climatic conditions spontaneously produce civilizations. See Post, Ch. "The Sense of Responsibility." Also refer to Appendix A "The Conflicts of Meaning."

For Toynbee, after all, no climatic or environmental conditions automatically lead to the emergence of civilization.



**A Civilization is that which develops from a challenge, evolving from chaos. A civilization emerges when it successfully overcomes challenges.**

Challenges do not merely shift the problem of definition from 'development' to 'challenge'; they serve as the driving force behind growth and adaptation. Arnold J. Toynbee's analysis involves similar difficulties as Spengler’s postulate of historical necessity, particularly regarding what constitutes a challenge.

Toynbee responds by suggesting that challenges provoke creative transformation in response to environmental conditions—exceeding merely passive comparison with external factors. This interaction is measured in three terms: the initial challenge, the adaptive response, and the resulting success or failure.

The Golden Mean illustrates how challenges evoke potent active responses. However, Toynbee defines these concepts analogically, explaining not so much the 'challenge' itself but rather the act of survival. Just as pleasure principles are juxtaposed with necessary dictums, challenge-and-response becomes a conceptual quantity leading to past actions.

To become meaningful, challenge-and-response should assert a purposeful action, acknowledging the uniqueness that enables civilizations to thrive uniquely through their responses to challenges.



In this analysis, Toynbee's method does not permit a precise empirical approach. Empiricism implies that every event results from a commensurate causal agent defined as a challenge, classifiable as a phenomenon subject to generalization and governed by laws. The hypothesis posits an issue illustrated by his survey of hard countries. It becomes apparent that along with Toynbee's twenty-one civilizations, all obstacles and topographical conditions are represented. This indicates that it is not the challenge itself which structures the response.

Toynbee utilizes the same misstatement to refute Spengler as well. 

The text suggests that rather than a singular challenge dictating responses, the diversity of civilizational experiences implies a broader set of factors at play in structuring societal development and reactions.



The search for challenge is fundamental to human experience. Freedom is not merely a balance of external factors that elicit the most suitable reaction; it is an inner state that seeks its own fulfillment. This internal drive can account for notable achievements without a margin of safety and at considerable cultural levels. However, once this exploration ceased, places like Easter Island disappeared into obscurity before re-emerging as colonial dependencies in the nineteenth century. Yet what happened? The vastness of the sea did not change, nor did the environmental stimulus lessen. The capacity to experience the ocean as a challenge diminished, along with the inner state that utilized it as a foil, sealing the fate of lands like Easter Island.

Toynbee recognized this purposive element but his ambiguous method resulted in a definition of freedom that cannot be found merely in external relationships or developed from an environment society. Freedom is not dependent on a set of conditions but is an inward experience. The assertion of pervasive purposiveness led Toynbee to the existence of no organ factor in the development of civilizations.

Societies do not represent organisms; they are the collective field of activity of their members and the medium for communications among constituents. Their growth is accomplished by mimicry, a social drill through which saints forge the roads toward increased civilization. This exhibits a failure of self-determination rather than an inexorable fate. Sin constitutes itself as the terror of creativity.

However, merely positing freedom is not enough. Toynbee rejected the concept of a civilization's soul, but his approach resulted in its indefinability. What then animates it? Spengler, for instance, did not use "soul" in a literal sense but defined it as "the image of a counter-world, or a mode of visualizing that which remains eternally alien to the physical eye."

If social drill constitutes a generic feature of social life by exhibiting those relations requiring no formal institutions because of their self-evidence, then Toynbee's approach can be understood. However, it requires further exploration to fully grasp its implications on freedom and societal development.



Beckley shifts the emphasis from manifestos or their organic aspects to a radical analysis of how they operate. Unlike Toynbee, who attributes the breakdown of civilizations to two main factors—namely the loss of creativity and the rise of mechanical routines—this approach presents formidable difficulties in specifying an operational model.

Toynbee associates societal decline with these two elements: the normalization of creativity and the mechanization that stifles innovation. By examining how systems self-implement, Beckley offers a nuanced perspective on civilizational breakdowns beyond Toynbee's foundational theories.



The concept of "mimesis," as indicated, refers to an organic factor crucial for societal cohesion. If a society cannot directly absorb the inspiration from saints due to a lack of inherent creativity within its members, then leaders can't reside in the creative minority. The masses must recognize the saints through an extraordinary event that necessitates a certain uniformity—a social dynamic that's hard to develop from inconsistent phenomena.

The breakdown of mimesis is described as a mechanical failure and not related to self-determination. According to Toynbee, the loss of inspiration by the creative minority does account for societal disintegration and the secession of an internal proletariat. However, if the uncreative majority possessed a criterion for creativity, it would negate the need for mimesis.

If mimesis is considered a generic feature of social life, then Toynbee's attempts to describe breakdowns in terms of purpose fail. He maintains that compulsion replaces charm as the bond during early stages of societal breakdown. A philosopher masked by a king faces frustration due to reliance on force; mimesis relies on this threat for effectiveness.
