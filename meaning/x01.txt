## Conclusions

This reflection on Spengler, Toynbee, and Kant reveals diverse perspectives on history, each contributing to a richer understanding of human progress and cultural development. Through metaphysical intuition, empirical analysis, and rational inquiry, we gain insights into the complexities of historical processes and their implications for contemporary society.

### Introductory Note

An introduction to an undergraduate honors thesis might seem presumptuous, but I believe its length and unorthodox method require explanation. The extended nature results from not fully realizing the scope at the start. As the work expanded, efforts were made to condense it by omitting chapters on Hegel and Schweitzer. However, these attempts did not sufficiently reduce the thesis size.

This introductory note highlights the core of my analysis, which may be considered the essence of my honors thesis. The methodology stems from dissatisfaction with critical treatments of Spengler, and to a lesser degree, Toynbee. I found that merely analytical criticism did not capture the full essence of Spengler's philosophy; part of its impact resides in his poetic imagination.

To convey this, I made an effort to encapsulate as much of Spengler’s style as possible in my expository passages, using lengthy quotations and relying on the text in some areas. To present Spengler’s philosophy fairly, I minimized phrases like "Spengler argues" or "according to Spengler," understanding that the expository passages contain Spengler's arguments.

My comments are concentrated at the end of each section, with my main analysis found in the conclusion on "History as Intuition."

I adopted a similar methodology for Toynbee. Purely analytical criticism also does not capture his stately empirical approach. I have discussed Toynbee’s main headings sufficiently to indicate his method, omitting most illustrations, except for a few instances. My comments are contained within introductions.



**The Argument (Introduction and Summary)**

**1. The Problem**

In every person's life, there comes a moment when they realize that out of all the seemingly limitless possibilities of youth, they have become one actuality. Life is not an open plain with forests and mountains beckoning in every direction, but rather it becomes apparent that one's journey has followed a specific path. Now, it seems impossible to go back or choose another route; the direction is set, and the limits are defined.

Every step taken thoughtlessly now becomes fraught with tremendous importance, each advance appearing unalterable. Looking back across the path, we are struck by its inexorability—how every step both limited us and served as a condition for the next. Viewing the plain we feel approaching with certainty, we recognize that many roads were possible. Many incidents shaped our wandering; we are here because it was we who journeyed and could be in a different spot had we veered differently. We know further that whichever road we might have chosen, we could not have remained stationary. Our being now is an inevitability shaped by the paths taken.

**Spengler (History as Intuition)**

**Metaphysics of Time**

**Conclusion 1**

In this section, I explore Spengler's view of history as an intuitive process. The metaphysical assumptions underlying his philosophy are examined to understand their influence on subsequent philosophical thought. My discussion is orthodox, given the many excellent treatments of Spengler's work.

**Politics, Economics, and The Machine**
