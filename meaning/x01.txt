·I￾Introductory Note. 
An introduot!op to an undergraduate hcnor theais may 
seem presumpt(oue, r
ru-: '!. bdlieve that its 1norc.1na te length 
and unorthodox method require an explanation. Aa a general 
reason, the length is due to the fact that I did not realize 
the implications of the aunject when I started to work on the 
the!is. As 1t grew, I have rru;:.je several efforts to cut it down, 
such as omitting the chapters I had written on Ilegel and Schweitzer. 
Since this still did not succeed in reducing this thesis to a more 
manageable size I have pointed out, st the end of this 1ntc,4uotory 
note, those portions which I believe�-to be the nucleus. or my analy￾sis and which may be considered my hcnor thesis. 
'lhe methodology re�ults from my diasatlsfaot1on with the 
critical tr�atments of Spengler, and to a leaser degree, of Toynbee.
I had the impression that merely enalytloal criticiem of Spengler 
.falslflea the real eaaen()e of his philosophy. JuBt as in the oase 
of Nietzache, part of 8pengler•e impact reside!!! in the poetio 
1maginat1venese of hi!!! desori�tiona. I have therefore made a 
conoo1oue effort 1n my expoa1to�y passages to capture as muoh aa 
posaible of Spengler's ntyle. Thie hae entailed rather lengthy
quotations au� in one or two plaooa oloae reliance on the te�t. 
To present Spengler'e philosophy as fairly aa poaaible I have kept 
auoh clauae1 as "Spengler argues", "according to Spengler" eto. to 
a mlnimumo 'Iha expository passagea are to be understood ae con� 
tialn1ng S9Emgler' &.1 arguments. · My oornmente are oonoentra ted in 
discussions at the end ?f each e�ction. My baalo anal1�la is to 
ba found in my "Conolu@lonG" on the Chapto�, "History - BB c Intui� 
tion" ., 
-II￾I have followed ea3entiall7 the srune methodology with 
Toynbee. Here too purely analytical oritlcism falsifies the 
stately empirical approach. I have discuaaed each of Toynbee'• 
main headln

gs at su.:fficlent length to indicate hia method ., though,
except for a very few instances, I have omitted all his illustra￾tions. Again� all mi oomments are contained in an introductory
