For example, it is possible to conceive of a world entirely enclosed within a large sphere, with temperature decreasing point by point until it reaches zero at the boundary. In such a world, every inhabitant would conceive of themselves in an infinite universe because as they approached the boundary, the falling temperature would cause their steps to become smaller and smaller.

The geometry of this closed-world system would contain many axioms, the self-evidence of which would vary considerably from Euclidean geometry. It can be proven that the shortest distance between two points, in that case, would be the arc of a circle, which cuts the bounding sphere orthogonally.

Moreover, from the point of view of modern logic, "self-evidence" cannot be conceived as a predicate of a proposition but rather as a direct relation between the person making the statement and the proposition. The reality of the system does not result in verifiable fact first but results in an instance that provides philosophical understanding.



Professor Royce has classified the various assumptions underlying the use of the term "axiom." It can be applied either in terms of inner necessity or self-evidence, subjective necessity, among other contexts. These axioms have been discussed in philosophy and science.



An unproven hypothesis from which other propositions can be deduced serves as a universally accepted proposition, and ultimately results from an individual's psychological constitution. The inner necessity theory is discarded before use because the proposed criterion for whole philosophy based on inner ideas could offer no better criterion than inner conviction. According to Professor Royce, this criterion only qualifies in terms of "subjective certainty," not self-evidence, and there is no necessary connection between the statement "This is true" and the objective reality of the subject.

The second context in which the term "axiom" has been used, as an unproven hypothesis, will be discussed further below. In the Aristotelian sense, a first principle that inheres in all scientific deductions as part of a universal first principle involves the discovery of a valid system. Though its axioms might have been assumed as hypotheses to start with, they acquire a certain highly mediated "self-evidence." For practical purposes, however, this self-evidence is equivalent to the assumption or unproven hypothesis.

The third conception considers an axiom as a universal starting point and assumption defining it. According to Professor Royce, such an axiom implies its own contradiction: one could not invoke universality as an argument except against someone dissenting. One dissent will therefore shake the validity of the axioms, forcing recourse to such limitations on universality as "universally accepted," "capable," etc.

The last meaning of an axiom, imposed by self-evidence dependent on psycho-genetic factors, becomes so vague that it loses all usefulness. To begin with, subconscious operations frequently obscure our real meanings and thus this is a proper field for the psychologist or philosopher to explore.



This passage refers to a definition of "axiom" previously alluded to. An axiom is conceived as an unproved proposition composed of undefined terms and assumed relations, which must be intuitively understood. From these axioms, the remaining propositions contained in the system can be deduced. This excludes the existence or necessary self-evidence of a universal first principle and a self-contained system of the universe. However, it allows for the formulation of systems, in the Hegelian sense, where axioms and theorems mutually imply each other. In such systems, the axioms of one can theoretically be the theorems of another, achieving a high degree of coherence.

The theory of systems is based on a frank recognition of the structuring effect exerted by metaphysical assumptions, rejecting empirical verifiability as its primary criterion for validity. Professor Royce's arguments have been developed because they contain the theoretical basis for the modern conception of axioms. Since "self-evidence" has been discarded in general usage, an axiom is defined as a term and relation that are entirely arbitrary, limited only by their appropriateness to the point at which perpendicularity would preclude them.

The axiom constitutes an embodiment of metaphysical assumptions and articulates the code by its inner necessity. This means absolute validity cannot be obtained; the simplicity of the code represents a function of the minimum number of terms required to be intuitively understood.

There is also a question as to the concept of simplicity itself. Simplicity, from a logical point of view, refers to logical simplicity. Every attempt at simplification involves reducing the essence of terms regardless of their equivalence.



Length is not only determined by the number of terms a definition involves, but also by its logical simplicity. Definitions play an important role in making code more abstract and axioms psychologically simpler.

Russell offers the following definition of "definitional terms": "The definition must be in terms of other expressions already defined. The terms to be introduced are revisionary; they depend largely on the person taking the definition." It must be noted, as Russell does, that the method of abbreviation does not present a question of fact but of convention and it imposes only the requirement of adhering to existing conventions.

Quine also notes in "Fundamentals of Logic" (as cited by Goodman) that concepts can often be simplified through careful definitions.



The axiom contains certain undefined criteria, with Professor Royce's formulation being a notable example. However, the choice among these terms and relations remains challenging. A segment could not abbreviate as "AB" without using the word "circle." The difference between definitions and primitive concepts is difficult to fix. Indeed, Young calls this set of assumptions and definitions "meta-physical assumptions expressed in activity," with their connections being only by mutual implication.

Is there any criterion for systematic knowledge? Stabbing asserts that the logician in his quest for axioms is not concerned with their truth or falsity but only with testing all their consequences. The real criterion for the validity of axioms is the validity of the theorems. Yet, what does "validity" mean? Three properties are usually sought in a system: consistency, independence, and completeness (or categoricity).

Independence describes that postulate or code-descriptive element which is not implied by any of the preceding code-descriptive elements nor their conjunction. The proof of independence consists of finding a concrete application that satisfies all axioms except the one in question. Independence is useful for distinguishing between theorems and axioms but has no necessary significance.

Moreover, complete independence may still be lacking due to certain amounts of implication or overlapping by which part of the postulates might be implied by the preceding elements or their conjunction. This can frequently not be national meanings. Thus, a definition that originally describes something may end up having multiple interpretations.
