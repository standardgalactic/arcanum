An answer to these questions is not contained purely in empirical data but in its interpretation, which depends on the presuppositions of others. There must be a constant conjunction that represents a philosophical resolution.

There can consequently exist no universally valid philosophy of history. It portrays the metaphysical resolution of the dilemma between the experiences of freedom and the knowledge of necessity and represents as much testimony to the philosophical opinions of its creators as an absolute standard for the elucidation of any moment in history. Since the content ascribed to life, moreover, constitutes the emanation of an inner state, there remains no avenue for the attainment of a lesser meaning beyond the more phenomenal appearance of power.

The resolution of the ultimate inner experience is a central topic in philosophy, particularly in relation to history and metaphysics.
