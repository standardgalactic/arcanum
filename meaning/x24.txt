If cultures begin by taking over foreign symbols, then those forms did not condition their users. Although Christian imagery may have been adapted to fit the needs of the Western soul, the whole history of the West was interpreted through the particular spiritual quality of this well-organized institution—its heritage from the Greek-Roman tradition. The infusion of new meaning into old forms involves a different process than spontaneous creativity.

Spengler's political theory contains similar inconsistencies. It proved impossible to reconcile the metaphysical postulate of alternate modes of behavior with a political symbolism expressed in Eastern contexts. The nobility as representatives of an inexorable destiny appears to have no scope for creativity, and the Priesthood, as the exponent of pure waking-consciousness, lacks symbolism.

Spengler's difficulty derives from resolving tendencies whose relative predominance characterizes modes of world-experience into incompatible alternatives. He therefore posits that the World-as-History and the World-as-Nature are merely symbolic representations of possible apprehensions of reality, not objective attributes of existence. History and Causality represent types of analysis concerned with noumenal and phenomenal occurrences. This does not prove their opposition; it merely indicates levels of interpretation.



The concept deals with events that can only be understood as a unity, viewed purposefully within history consciously lived.

Cleaned-up version:

The concept addresses events that can only be understood as a unit, seen as destiny evaluated purposefully and history consciously lived.



A purely analytical criticism of Spengler's work might overlook the deeper philosophical levels he explores. These reside in his evocation of elements of life that remain mysterious—elements central to the subjective inner experience, such as intuition and existence itself. Spengler’s vision fostered an approach to history that transcended mere causal analysis or the shallow dogmatism of many progressive theories.

No discussion of internal truths can invalidate the force or accuracy of Spengler's description of Christ's journey to Jerusalem, nor diminish the dramatic quality of the exposition of the dilemma in Luke. After all has been said, the conviction remains that Spengler discovered a poetry in life which transcends barren systems and their infinite explanations.

Such an approach does present dangers. However, it offers a unique perspective by focusing on the intangible aspects of human experience that often escape traditional analysis.



Latent antinomies in teleological thought may lead to a cult of sheer logic. In any philosophical discussion, one must sharply distinguish between philosophical assumptions and their arguments. A rejection of the latter may merely mean that the metaphysical postulates are capable of stronger supporting formulation. Logic can aid in evaluating internal consistency and relevance but cannot be utilized only by testing for utilizing mathematics as an alternative set of assumptions, which is not an objective standard of validity.

Therefore, it is possible to offer different explanations for all of Plenge's symbols of a cultural image without refuting the concept (see Appendix A - 'The Concepts of Meaning'), of which recent history has seen many examples. But the fact that certain arguments if pressed to an extreme involve unacceptable consequences does not necessarily disprove them. It indicates rather than in ultimate problems of life, one must find the resolution within himself, not in technical solutions. Every event is not merely an effect but also an experience. As self-effect, it is subject to...



Causal determinism, as an experience that contains the meaning of freedom and the essence of personality, offers accounts for the unsatisfactoriness of ethical systems like those proposed by thinkers such as Northrop Frye, who conceives values as approachable only through methodology. It wasn't Spinoza's geometrical method that led to liberal concepts but his attitude which a priori directed the method. Similarly, it was likely that Spengler understood this and the underlying unity of all human strivings for human endeavor. However, his potential imagination caused him to overvalue the realm of necessity and underestimate the purposive element.

Perhaps the most serious original criticism against Spengler comes from Heidegger, who contrasted reason and inner experience, causality and will. On the climb to the top of Mount Purgatory, he absorbed the essence of human wisdom. Henceforth, only an inner experience can conduct him. When Beatrice appears, she just as surely turns to guidance for Virgil, but here reason is powerless.

The Idea of the Good, just as Kant's idea of freedom, represents the final attainment of human transcendence—it is a matter of inner illumination rather than technical manipulation. This concept develops in "The True Sense of Responsibility."

Of his uneasy way between world-as-experience, which is the only approach to an apprehension of purposiveness, and his vision of it as mere repetition of power phenomena, he constantly stresses the uniqueness of experience yet finds in his history no more than the generality of phenomena. The totality of man's longing cannot achieve a sanctification through mere cataloguing or appearances but must attain meaning through the specific scope in human experiences.

Spengler attempts to resolve these issues by categorizing occurrences without addressing their deeper significance, failing to capture the true essence and individuality that characterize human experience.



Difficulties arise from his emphasis on the historical rather than the moral aspects of existence. He is always concerned with an evaluation of elements or forces, which clearly represents a manifestation of a will-to-power from a pragmatic rather than an ethical point of view. This emphasis on success leads to that strict separation of history and philosophy, not only but also contrary to the person or Christ constitutes. However, no truth is without its historical tendency, and every effective conduct implies some normative element. 

The method of this work is historical. It therefore recognizes the religious as well as the moral equally with the philosophical.
