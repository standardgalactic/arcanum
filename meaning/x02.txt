Here, I delve into the implications of political and economic systems within historical contexts. The role of technology as a transformative force is also considered, drawing from Spengler's insights.

**Toynbee: Metaphysics**

**The Nature and Essence of Civilizations**

This section discusses Toynbee's metaphysical approach to understanding civilizations. His views on the cyclical nature of history and the essence of cultural development are analyzed.

**Conclusion 2**

In this conclusion, I summarize Toynbee's contributions and their philosophical significance. The insights gained from his work are contextualized within broader historical discourse.

**Kant (Entire Chapter)**

This chapter is dedicated to Kant's philosophy, approached from my general viewpoint. While still tentative, it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of his ideas on history as an empirical science.

**The Sense or Responsibility**

This section examines the philosophical implications of responsibility in human actions, drawing from Kantian ethics and metaphysics.

**The Appendix**

Written after engaging with a logical positivist seminar paper, this appendix reflects my thoughts on meaning and validity within logic. It includes insights from discussions with Professor Henry Scheffer and personal consultations. The philosophical interpretation of logical systems is presented as my own analysis. While written as a unit, the reader may focus only on selected sections as part of the thesis argument.



In fact, somewhere else it could have existed in some position. We've encountered the problem of Necessity and Freedom—the irreversibility of our actions and the directedness of our lives. What is the meaning of necessity, and where does it arise?

Necessity is an attribute of the past. Events viewed retrospectively appear inevitable; the fact of their occurrence testifies to this inevitability. Causality expresses a pattern that the mind imposes on a sequence of events in order to make them comprehensible. It is formulated as a law, revealing trends of recurrence and assumptions of comparability.

However, it fights against the unique, against personal experiences, and inward bliss. Necessity recognizes only quantitative differences and conceives survival as its sole test of historical fitness. Necessity finds the typical in man, the inexorable in events, and the inevitable in existence. Its doctrine is the philosophy of 'Eternal Recurrence,' which the devil tells Ivan Karamazoff.

"But our present earth may have been repeated a thousand times. Why has it become extinct, frozen, cracked, broken into bits, disintegrated into its elements, risen again above the firmament, then once more become a comet, and again an sun, from the sun becoming earth, and on another earth the same sequence may have been repeated endlessly with every detail exactly the same."

Yet every event is not only an effect but also an inward experience. As an effect, it is ruled by necessity; as an experience, it reveals the unique in personality. The desire to reconcile our experience of freedom with a determined environment is the impulse of poetry and the dilemma of philosophy.

Relationalism attempted to solve this problem by considering its purposes as the objective pattern of occurrences and equating freedom with necessity. The British skeptics, particularly Hume, subjected these notions to rigorous criticism and denied both necessity and purposiveness. They argued that perception involves the impact of empirical entities on a mind like wax, whose sensations of pleasure are largely passive and whose concept of necessity describes a constant conjunction while to which freedom is ascribed.

The limits of thought cannot be established by thought itself. Hume's skepticism caused him to abandon philosophy while still a young man, and Descartes was forced to invoke God as a guarantor of external reality with the aid of faculties whose accuracy he had seriously questioned.

Kant realized that only an inward experience can transcend the inexorability of completed action. He limited knowledge to make room for belief and affirmed that the reality subject to the laws of causality is given by sensuous experience and exhausted in the phenomenal world. Beyond that, man has a transcendental experience of freedom which elevates him above the realm of necessity into a higher world-order conditioning all appearances.

Freedom is an inward state, an attitude accompanying every action. This disproves Hume's assertion that nothing can be definitely known since one can always imagine the opposite of any thought. Our experience of freedom testifies to a fact of existence which no thought-process can deny.



### The Paradox of Freedom and Determinism

Descartes' famous assertion, "cogito ergo sum," posits that existence is confirmed by thought. However, this idea does not directly address the complexities surrounding human freedom and determinism—the philosophical dilemma concerning how our actions can be both freely chosen and yet have inevitable consequences.
