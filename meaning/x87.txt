Three progressively wider stands are recognized: the phenomenological (Leibniz), the physical, and the logical. Hume's distinction admits only true tautologies—statements that can be conceived without contradiction.

This analysis implies that a statement can be meaningful or not, depending on the criterion used. For example, an assertion about a 500-year-old man in a logical sense may not represent an inner contradiction but would have to be denied by physical criteria. As in Husserl's theory of description, the assertion occurs subsequent to a query concerning what the question will limit as answers.

Such a lean towards positivistic logic, from one attempt to confine meaning by a test of verifiability, is forced by its inner contradictions into an admission of criteria that extend the range of meaningful statements. This becomes the precursor of pre-assertional logic, which addresses the metaphysical problem only after determining its range by the hypothesis.

**2. True Sentences**

True sentences have meaning if they obtain the assertion within a logical primitive on statements. 

This leads to an inquiry into the very possibility of knowledge and ever-sharper definitions of epistemological structures. On one side, there is extensive classification of types of judgments—propositions and inferences; on the other, the middle ground of inherent analysis of assertions remains inadequately analyzed.

The difficulty of this position relates to attempts to set metaphysical bounds, achieved only by an implicit motion towards wider criteria of meaning, which are moreover modulated by a psychological fiction of the speaker. Quine continues this analysis, while Reichenbach edits various levels of criteria.

It remained for pre-assertional logic to develop their implications to their ultimate conclusion and thus allow for the variability of metaphysical assumptions as the condition of meaning.



Here is a refined version:

**The Role of Professional Philosophical Logic**

Professional philosophical logic involves both descriptive and prescriptive elements in its analysis and assessment, including logical propositions, the theory of meaning, properties, and the propositional logic. It addresses differences in normative logic by considering the metaphysical and psychological theories that propose various levels of flexibility for the underlying suppositions determining meaning.

This approach does not assume an external importance of propositions as falling outside the realm of pure logic. Instead, it emphasizes that before one can classify something, one must know what it is they wish to categorize. This distinguishes between the eventual validity of its assertions from the inherent linguistic and logical truths of statements.

The question then resolves itself for the self in logical terms.

The primary function of a concept is to exhibit the internal structure of a statement and its logical possibilities. Only after having examined this can one form a judgment about it in terms of adequacy, validity, or other criteria.

A concept must be expressed using language that is both clear and logical. The aim is to use a natural language structured so as to accurately reflect these aspects, without unnecessary complexity or ambiguity.



Professor Scheffer clarifies truth and falsity, with the express proviso that any declaration involves a psychological element, the speaker being both a psychologist and a philosophical one. Explaining on this criterion, we see that propositional logic does not have to conform to traditional subject-predicate structures, nor to the existence of terms within propositions.

This approach seeks internal truth by examining what is internally true or false. Richard Reichenbach considers sententialism. It examines the internal structure and looks for a form that best exhibits its possibilities. Then it evaluates what is the best form of logic in practice for presentational languages, such as those used by Joseph or Stalnaker.

In summary, this approach does not adhere to traditional logical constraints but seeks versatility and adaptability through examining the interplay between internal and external elements.
