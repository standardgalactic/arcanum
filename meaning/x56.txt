Throughout Toynbee's work, the schism in the soul, and the tendency to reject all submission as sham becomes more pronounced. The doom of the decline of civilizations derives meaning from an affirmation of the eternal validity of the Kingdom of God. The biological and theological views are found to be irreconcilable after all. The Élan Vital operates through them alone; it seeks a precise understanding and words to convey this profound notion.



In the succession of events, the transformation into Superman represents an inspiration for mundane creativity that becomes a necessary process. However, achieving this new level of perception often produces concomitant disintegration in universal structures like the church and challenges the repository of perceived truths.

In "The Inevitable Peace" by Francis A. Schaeffer (p. 111), there is a critical examination of these concepts. The author argues that the idea of this process being a chimera—an unattainable ideal—is inevitable. 

For my critique on this concept, refer to my book, op. cit., Vol. VI.



Teachings on faith suggest that a new state of being, as defined by Yin, excludes the necessary validity of higher religion. This leads to two attitudes towards Christianity. The first is that the universal church becomes an incident by-product of disintegration. The eternal applicability of Christianity denies the substantiality of worldly endeavors and makes its precepts appear as stages of transitory futility. If man succeeds in transforming himself, he will never know a higher faith than the appearance of religion again, signaling the doom of worldly endeavor.

What is the real tragedy in Toynbee's work? It lies in the birth or disintegration of civilizations. Toynbee notes a hint from Spengler but goes further. What has revealed itself is not so much a religious phenomenon as an evolutionary process. This notion suggests a cycle where civilizations are born, grow, and inevitably decline.

Toynbee’s primary focus seems to be on how civilizations rise and fall, highlighting the transient nature of human endeavors in contrast to eternal spiritual truths.



God, in success regarding the merit of activity, has two main aspects: time and space, causality, destiny, and continuity remain totally uncertain. For Spengler, both had a religious experience but explicitly affirmed that this is the essence of success from which it arises.

His history or, in Toynbee's terms, its rejection of "My kingdom is not of this world." This was his final word on the subject, admitting no nature has a glorious status.



In Tony Harrison's poem "Beaumont and Fletcher," he explores themes related to religion, society, and defense in a nuanced manner. The poem not only addresses the historical context of religious schisms but also delves into the evolving meanings of words like "axiomatic" over time.

The complexity of these themes is presented through Harrison's use of language and imagery, creating layers of interpretation. He examines how societal divisions and cultural shifts impact our understanding of foundational beliefs and expressions, suggesting that what once seemed unequivocal can become ambiguous with changing perspectives.

Harrison’s work often reflects his keen interest in the intersections between personal experience, historical events, and linguistic evolution. In "Beaumont and Fletcher," this is evident as he navigates through intricate themes using a sophisticated poetic structure.



Tension between history or nature, politics, or religion often presents a dilemma where there is no honest way to compromise. Statesmen can be deeply religious, and an altruistic man can die for his country, but they must both know on which side they truly stand. There is no middle ground when these issues have been delineated; one must choose.

Eternity lies between the course of history and the existence of a divine world order. This captures the essence of the moment in which Plato and Christ confronted each other. In Spengler's abrupt language, this expresses the full implication of Toynbee's concept of transformation.

Toynbee’s method introduces inconsistencies. It offers no support for the assumption of an Élan vital manifesting itself in progress. Instead, it structures all historical epochs as periods that rise and fall due to internal success or failure. The decline of the Holy Roman Empire, according to Toynbee, was caused by the gradual displacement of a ruling dynasty.



From the edge of the lens to the front of your marshmallow, which impairs the ability to see the interior structure of the eye clearly.

This seems to mistake what is represented at best in terms of perception. A person may have a clear understanding but still lack insight into their own internal processes, as described by Spengler's quotation and further compared with the following statement by Toynbee: "In fact, the philosopher-king is bound to fail because he is attempting to unite two contradictory natures in a single person. The philosopher rules himself by living truthfully."



While on their travels, the Hohenstaufen were perhaps instrumental in bringing the imperial position to its nadir. Although their immense territorial realm lay rather at the center of the Empire, it hardly resulted from a centralized economy or administrative capability.
