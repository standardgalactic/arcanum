**Expectations**

In the Western perspective, one stands before a Greek frieze but becomes immersed in culture itself. It is not just an experience; it is undergoing profound cultural transformations. Every perception and every experience that once had its own center of gravity in spatial dynamics is expressed through this lens, which directs the observer's position and pulls them into its space-time treatment.

The true Western art represents the eternal striving of its restless soul, completing the described dimension of space with an upward drive. This force filled cathedrals in Europe and burst beyond into the realm of music in Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. However, with Wagner, size is no longer about inward representation but rather the disavowal of greatness and grandeur, heralding the end of a great tradition.

Faustian naturalism represents merely a mirror of these tendencies. What was once felt as God in religious experience is now transformed into something else entirely.



The concept of an all-pervasive force in physics becomes prominent as the Western soul gravitates towards a denial of substantiality, contrasting with the passionate assertion of the object found in the Hellenic world-feeling. In this context, space itself is perceived as a physical force expressing both inertia and energy, whether through Newtonian mechanics or quantum theory.

As stated by Spengler, natural science becomes increasingly esoteric and abstract, dissolving all sense-experience of phenomenal reality into its hypotheses. The infinite space postulated by astronomy and the encompassing geological periods are not empirical observations but resolutions of the soul, which considers the recognition of limits as an expression of its existence. It is the spirit that motivates these scientific pursuits.



The invention or "un-power" action-at-a-distance, discovered independently by the Chinese, has a destiny idea comparable to that of Western culture at its contemporary stage of development. This is the mentality that produces dynasties as objects of reverence and embodying its feeling for care in the political world.

Cabinet diplomacy, the determination to master space, the travels of Spanish and Portuguese explorers, the pioneers of the American West, and the drive for records of all sorts are emanations of the Faustian will-to-infinity. The mere possibility of the West, which views the whole world as a working hypothesis, and the great symbol of the machine as a perpetual motion represents the assertion of mastery over nature, appearing in metaphorical shape in the Kantian forms *a priori*.

The Faustian will-to-power expresses the inner need of a culture that recognizes toleration only as the non-interference with a field or activity whenever it attempts to impose its views on behalf of mankind. This accounts for the loneliness of Faustian men, of which Lear on the Heath buffeted by man and nature, and Hamlet are the tragic exponents. Where the lament of the hero expresses the essence of the Apollinian dramatic intention, the inner distance of Shakespearean heroes is unbridgeable.

The ethics of the great deed, which in Gothic times was felt as an inner experience in one's fight towards God, are transformed into work by a new moral ideal. This new social morality sees itself as a secular task.



To immerse oneself into its vision, a high wisdom on behalf of all, which will soon present itself as a concept to the ultimate force of time—the era of the Faustian spirit—always contains laws that include "not," "the," and "Duty." These are essential elements in a realm where work becomes a form of ethical expression. The guiding principle is articulated as: "Thou shalt."

This then represents Spengler's depiction of the Faustian soul, characterized by an unending drive towards infinity, a will to power, and a longing of a lonely ego adrift in boundless space that has lost its bearings.

In this context, with years passing under the autumn sky of Reflection, one must strive for clarity.



Transform this text by improving its clarity and removing unnecessary elements:

Western man's transcendental view of history makes him particularly suited to write a morphology of it. The Classical culture could not encompass such a perspective; its tragedy was the senseless incident. However, Shakespeare's culture, which lifts the incident into significance, is exemplified in Spengler.

This reflection written in 1918 highlights how Western thought transcends mere historical incidents, offering a broader understanding of cultural evolution.

Into a token of destiny, view man's actions as symbols  
and judge them not by their truth, but by their ever-changing trueness, their aptness in the flux of eternal becoming; which will also be the fate of his culture—to die.
