Thus, night has always been felt as akin to death, and the idea of an invisible God constitutes the highest manifestation of human transcendence. This realization makes the depth-experience the most significant concept in a person's life. Human awareness depends on the recognition of the Thou, or the existence of the other, just as the notion of Destiny is tied up with the rhythm of becoming and the felt pulse of the organic.

Similarly, waking-consciousness comes to full awareness through the experience of death. At that moment, man first realizes his immensity in the universe and the episodic nature of his existence. The animal lives in a pure present and dies without knowledge of its fact, but for man, life is a short span between birth and death.

The enigma of Time first appears, with the realization of limits and the transitoriness of existence. Therefore, the first manifestation of higher thought occurs as meditation upon death.

Man rebels at the thought of the episodic nature of life, its mystery, and his loneliness in the universe. The enigmatic that threatens the existence of primitive man begins to be mastered by the act of naming objects, which serves both as a limitation and an assertion of supremacy. The wish to transcend materiality develops into the process of conjuring the world through cultivation by the religious soul and through technique in an age when numerical expressions take form.

In primitive societies, the enigma is conquered by religion, which requires forms whose knowledge is restricted and rites that must be exact. As a function of the soul's depth experience, religion contains the grand myth of man's culture—the actualization of its primal role expressed through deeds.



In the vivid portrayal of a forceful God, as seen in Gothic art, there is an image of the divine hovering above the cave-world of the Magian soul. Similarly, within the Apollinian state lies each body’s essence. Reactions that were once considered total or absolute gradually become permissible through an understanding of significance detached from sensation—a process referred to as thought.

Prosaic causality emerges, replacing the holy causality of religion, and withdraws from the world of becoming to analyze it. However, natural knowledge is not new; rather, it is a consequence of the preceding religious worldview. All theories are merely an analysis—and even a rebuttal presupposes some object—of the lived metaphysics of culture’s youth. No matter how far natural science advances, at its edge hovers the inexplicable residue: God as everything beyond causal analysis.

Each scientific exploration or cultural transformation postulates endless compatibility of phenomena. The world reveals an eternal process of becoming, but causality operates only on that which is already become. The realm of becoming knows only singularly occurring acts, while the realm of pure being operates with eternal truths. The conflict between rhythm and tension, destiny and causality permeates existence and history.

Two images of the world are possible: the World-as-Story, where becoming is ordered in reference to the become, or the World-as-Nature, where the opposite occurs. In the World-as-Story, there is a dynamic process of growth with the will-to-live as the only criterion for success and source of motivation. Here, only subjects and objects exist. To live for abstractions involves suffering from an innate understanding of being one's own entity. Its chroniclers are individuals whose physiognomy enables them to apprehend the totality of events in poetic unity, realizing the insufficiency of causal analysis.

Its representatives are the great statesmen who embody the meaning of occurrences and the men of blood who feel the cosmic beat and actualize it. Napoleon stated at the beginning of the Russian campaign: "I feel myself driven toward an end that I do not know."



The passage reflects on a struggle for mastery over destiny, suggesting that even the greatest forces in the world cannot prevail against certain principles or truths. The World-as-Nature has its triumphs through connections that represent humanity's attempt to achieve control over fate. It can reach its highest form of liberation and freedom from the burdens of conscious existence, which is characterized by isolation within insurmountable boundaries.

Religion, according to this view, fights against the power of blood and instinct, withdrawing into a kind of asceticism while recognizing the necessity of tension. Ultimately, it aims for love. Morality is seen as an eternal plan of conduct applicable even if humanity did not exist. A saint must recognize that his victories are not worldly; temporal success requires political tools.

This dilemma is poetically represented in the interaction between Pilate and Christ, where Pilate's question "What is truth?" symbolizes the self-confidence of the State and the essence of history. The response lies not in words but in the actions of the prisoner: it underscores the difference between form-worlds—between becoming and being, destiny and causality, history and nature. Consciousness, tied to waking life, finds itself within these dualities.



The essence of the antinomy—the real alternatives of life—is encapsulated in Spengler's philosophy. The subject, a waking being that attempts to dominate destiny, is central here. Politicians despise thinkers and drafters rightly because all worldly ambition seems like sham and deception to believers; they are also correct. A ruler attempting to improve religion for practical, worldly purposes is foolish. Similarly, a sociologist-preacher who aims to bring peace and righteousness into the world of actuality is also misguided. Faith has yet to alter the world, as no fact can dispute it. Therefore, one must be either a hero or a saint; anything in between is not wisdom but banality.

Spengler resolved the dilemma of our experience of freedom versus knowledge of necessity into postulates of alternatives. The opposition of becoming and being, the tension between Destiny and Causality, constitutes the metaphysical basis of his philosophy of history. The actualization of this vital pulse achieves its highest form when its direction is taken for granted. Waking consciousness gains dominance gradually by reducing the lived experience to a cosmic beat. Ultimately, man drifts in a world whose purpose is no longer his own; culture turns into civilization, petrifies, and dies.



The imaginative nature of this philosophy cannot conceal its inner complexities. The opposition between becoming and being, Destiny and Causality, Necessity and Freedom seems to reduce existence to mere vegetating. However, necessity explains only past actions. Its actualization in conduct requires a "moral consciousness," which operates with the inner conviction of choice. If cultures are distinguished by their struggle for the actualization of an idea, then the specificity of history resides in an element of purposiveness, not in one inexorable destiny.

The World-as-History and the World-as-Nature are merely metaphysical abstractions for the apprehension of events, not objective models of real occurrences. Spengler implies that the man-of-fact lives by a deep-seated destiny and thereby achieves his triumphs. But again, this does not mean to prove the dominance of becoming over being or History over waking-consciousness. The recognition of immensity depends on waking consciousness.

The inner self is no guide to political conduct. Effective leadership is always forced—whatever its motives—to represent itself as the carrier of ideas, embodying purposes. All truly great achievements in history resulted from the actualization of principles, not from the clever evaluation of political conditions. Only plants are purely pragmatic entities. The Causality which motivates man involves more than just responding to predetermined paths.



The experience of freedom, as discussed here, is not derived from the physical world but arises from a personal, mystical relationship with the Infinite.

Conversely, the man-at-freedom, such as the saint, represents more than mere working-consciousness. As Spengler notes and refutes himself through his analogy that "to restrain blood, one must have blood," what gives majesty to Christ or Muhammad is not their logical consistency but their pertinence to the very basis of human longing.
