The end of nomad empires is usually violent, sudden, and total, much like their beginning. Some Nomad conquerors, such as the Ottomans, succeeded in imposing lasting empires on sedentary populations at the price of arresting their own civilization. Catapulted out of the steppe into the Balkans by the Mongols' push, the Ottoman political beginnings were auspicious because they provided a universal state which the Balkan offshoots of Orthodox Christianity could not achieve for themselves.

However, the duration of the Ottoman Empire was challenged by an unfortunate response to the extreme conditions it faced. The Ottomans remembered that successful utilization of animal flocks depended on the relationship between the shepherd and the herd, as well as employing animal auxiliaries like dogs and horses. This lesson they applied to their Balkan empire, taking advantage of human auxiliaries forcibly from their Christian subjects.

The employment of slaves as soldiers and administrators, including the Janissaries, was a key strategy in maintaining control over their territories.



The Ottoman case has been a tour de force by which all success was achieved until this response had to confront its consequences, including excluding the Ottomans from any administrative and political responsibility due to their normal fiber decaying in the absence of any effective stimulus. The Janissaries could maintain their efficiency only as long as their numbers were small, itself a tour de force. Eventually, the loss of public spirit by the ruling Ottomans led to a dilution of the Janissaries and arrested the civil society in Europe represented by its absence. This was evidenced by the Ottoman Empire's external expansion as the Ottomans attempted to emulate past empires.

Throughout history, Nomad Empires illustrate how civilizations become extended through excessive challenges from either the physical environment, such as the steppes for human populations, or from the impact of sedentary populations and their subsequent colonization. The case of the Ottoman Empire exemplifies this dynamic.



**Survival Characterizes Civilizations**

Civilization is achieved through proficiency in one excellence, which a creative imagination applies across all fields. The Centaur, representing a fusion of human intelligence and animal strength, symbolizes the outsider's view of the Nomad rider. It encapsulates the tension between rationalism and animality that forms another aspect of arrested civilizations. Their reactive ability becomes concentrated on mastering one challenge; however, this first reduces their capacity to respond properly to inevitable new challenges inherent in existence.

Utopias, by definition, attempt to peg societies at a certain level, exhibiting a tendency toward caste and specialization. Arrested civilizations thus disprove both the uniformity of civilization development and the necessity for constant growth.

If growth is not necessary for civilization's existence but depends on balanced responses to various challenges, what is its nature? Toynbee again bases his answer on mythology. Aeschylus' "Prometheus Bound" contains symbolic representations of the conditions attending growth. Having attained dominance over Olympus, Zeus is chiefly concerned with maintaining his mastery. Any change can detract from the stability of his power. Yet, Zeus did not achieve his eminence unaided; he had the Titan Prometheus, embodying foresight and creativity—the embodiment of the Life Force—working constantly for progress against arrest, representing thought against force.

No amount of physical compulsion can wrest Prometheus's secret from him, and in the end, there is reconciliation. Zeus accepts creativity as a condition for his own existence. He had not been what he seemed. 

**Conclusions**

Civilization thrives on creative engagement with challenges rather than static perfection or uniformity. It requires a dynamic balance between maintaining established norms and fostering innovation to adapt to new circumstances.



The Toynbee thesis, as seen in Aeschylus's trilogy *The Oresteia*, presents a view of history not just as a sequence of events but as a poetic chronicle that intertwines with mythological and historical elements. According to this interpretation, the growth of Hellas (ancient Greece) is marked by a series of successful responses to recurring challenges.

Initially, Greek civilization faced the challenge posed by barbarian invaders. The Greeks' response was military victory over these threats. This victory led to a significant transformation: rather than remaining a collection of isolated villages, Greece evolved into a world of cities and culture, signifying an advanced stage in social development.

However, this new structure encountered its own limits. The maximum population density that agriculture could support proved inflexible. To address the problems arising from these limitations, overpopulation necessitated outward expansion.

Subsequently, as Hellenic imperial ambitions grew, they triggered a reaction among Mediterranean peoples, calling for greater unity across the region. This dynamic interplay of challenge and response highlights the adaptive nature of Greek civilization throughout its history.



It was a long-fought conflict that finally came to be solved by Athens, which became known as the "education of Hellas." Under its guidance, Greek colonies flourished. There is doubt about whether Athens' education focused on the principles of Pericles, Socrates, or Plato.

The Greek population thrived under this influence. The economic and cultural references sensibly reflect the era's values and advancements.



Guidance during Greek expansion transformed into indirect methods, with commerce and production becoming key survival strategies. Aeschylus's trilogy offers testimony to the intensity of the Athenian response.

In Toynbee's scheme, growth is revealed as a process of successful responses to recurrent challenges. "The optimum is that which provides a stimulus for a response that carries the civilization beyond the point of exact balance—the condition of arrested civilization—into a continuing disequilibrium." The step from genesis to growth exhibits a repetitive, recurrent rhythm in which equilibrium constitutes breakdown.
