While Toynbee's assumptions and expressions on the genesis of civilizations are mystical, the initial conditions remain unresolved. The empirical method he adopts follows a success pattern where recognizing God’s love depends on achieving new levels of integration or overcoming disruptions.



The concept that civilization has not managed to control its own process challenges a metaphysical resolution rather than presenting historical data as fact. The assertion regarding history's purpose represents an immanent activity within the Life Force, confronting and regenerating reality through change.

This pragmatic approach results in an analysis of response almost exclusively in terms of challenge, representing the best refinement of environment theory. Empiricism and noumenal experience continue to be logical antinomies. The purpose of God is derived syllogistically from a normative pattern based on Toynbee's conception of a fair wager.

Toynbee’s distinction between creative phases of Yin and Yang raises many problems. If integration represents organic being and Yang purposive orientation, must these two stages operate successively? They never seem to exhibit perfect state or either absolute Integration or absolute differentiation. It appears that the attitude and condition of primitive societies result from the same ego-centric delusion that claims one Civilization as the acme of achievement. Similarly, the dynamism of civilized life does not represent a purposefulness that completely transcends tradition and the organic factor.

Speer resolved the problem of necessity versus freedom by postulating alternative modes of behavior in separate realms. In his view, history was ruled in its main tendencies by an immanent Destiny not to be influenced by human volition. Toynbee argued for successive stages in a non-evolutionary, biological process ruled by mimicry rather than a social drill based on uniformity in history, for which no warranty can be found in empirical data. It seems that drill hardly represents a perceived purpose as the realm of almost creative individual agency.

The concept of "prolonged growth" in Toynbee's scheme does not exhibit an inherent linear trajectory but rather a process of inward self-territorialization, where the penalty for unsuccessful responses is lessened. Just as the genesis of civilization arises from the challenge of disintegration, it reveals itself through a series of successive responses to recurring challenges. The loss of the capacity for successful responses or an excessive challenge marks the ages.

The difficulty of reconciling the metaphysical with the empirical reappears in Toynbee's criterion for growth: ethical maturation, which involves moving from macrocosm to microcosm. As a theologian, Toynbee describes this as emanation; as an empiricist, he finds it only in a physical extent where periphery becomes its own environment.

Toynbee navigates between condensing the breakdown of insufficient response or insuperable challenge. The incommensurability of theological and biological realms appears throughout his analysis. Once the genesis of civilization is achieved and inherent dangers overcome, must their subsequent development follow a uniform pattern? Does every civilization that avoids abortion exhibit identical symptoms of growth?

Toynbee denies the necessity of uninterrupted growth and distinguishes a third aspect or genus: the arrested civilizations as an illustration. All arrested civilizations have been petrified in response to such severity that their solution required a tour de force, consuming all societal strength for a task achieved only at the price of pegging the civilization at a level of inflexible readiness for overreaction.

Such was the case with the Polynesians, who responded to the challenge of the Pacific Ocean with intensity just sufficient for maintaining equilibrium. They succeeded in crossing vast spaces but never safely until their tradition became slack and their civilization degenerated on forgotten islands.

In Toynbee's conception of history as a cycle whose existence results from a successive response to the concurrent challenge of desiccation, the drought forces societies into action.



The goal is to convert large groups of animals into a more fertile region or to launch them across the steppe, no longer treating these as categories of plants but of animals. Manifestly, this latter is a higher art, more comparable to industry than agriculture. It substitutes indirect utilization of vegetation for planting crops. By means of grazing animals, the specific produce of the steppe is transformed into food and clothing. This involves a division of labor and a hierarchy among animal species (e.g., cattle or auxiliary species like dogs, camels, etc.). The survival of the group depends on finely-tuned adaptation to an environment that leaves no margin for lax discipline and severely limits possible responses.

The expansion of nomads into settled areas results from further increases in environmental severity, reducing the narrow balance of survival. Alternatively, the nomad may be pulled out of the steppe by a vacuum in neighboring society. The transformation of a Nomadic community from a master of the physical environment on the steppe to a lord of the human environment of a civilization constitutes the supreme challenge of this stage of development.

The nomad attempts to respond to these stimuli by treating his human subjects as he would cattle and changes from a herder of cattle to a herder of men. This was the reaction of the Avars, who collected their slave prisoners into flocks and placed them in vast semicircles around the Hungarian plain. While the composite society constituted by the nomads and their followers represents the most efficient mode of survival on the steppe, it presents significant challenges when interacting with settled civilizations.



Survival is crucial for every organism, including human society. The Nomad division adapts to a wide range of conditions, thriving in both fields and cities. Their organization into nomadic groups represents one successful use of the ecological method and demonstrates a practical application of Toynbee's concept of Challenge and Response.

The structure of these societies, often organized around flocks or herds, allows them to respond dynamically to environmental challenges. This adaptability is presented in detail because it serves as some of the happiest examples of a successful ecological approach. It also reflects a practical implementation of Toynbee’s ideas, showcasing how human communities can sustainably navigate diverse environments through mobility and flexibility.

Toynbee's work emphasizes that such societies are adept at turning challenges into opportunities for growth and adaptation, illustrating a harmonious balance with their surroundings.



The nomadic empires' establishment on a base of sedentary people accounts for their relative inefficacy. The virtues that led to early success were self-reliance and physical toughness, regarded as trophies in an environment where no large political entity could withstand them. The conqueror's generosity parallels the increasing state among sedentary settlers who viewed foreign domination as a constant challenge.
