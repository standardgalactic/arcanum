It was different on the Continent. There, the two sides of liberalism—freedom from restrictions or social bonds—operated for all critics and solvers of intellectual problems, whether they were concerned with money or any other essence of liberty. The distrust of authority felt by the Third Estate was so widespread.



It was ready to assure its freedom through a dictatorship. This represents the panic felt by any multitude that no longer feels "in condition." The wishful consciousness, which has so dominated the destiny aspect, is now ready to salvage its inner cohesion by submitting to an authority it would never tolerate if legitimate. This is the essence of the second tyranny, or Alexander's, or Napoleon's. The self-evident basis for new creativity has disappeared, and naked power becomes the criterion for success.

Out of the depths of the Megalopolis emerges at this stage, in Rome, in Paris, a formal apparatus that expresses itself no longer as mere opposition to traditional values but as the very embodiment of nihilistic power. To which various languages attach equally contemptuous labels: Canaille, Pöbel, Mob. Its influence is out of proportion to its numbers since it always overshadows sentiment, all forcing its way across the social landscape by sheer activity.

The bourgeoisie henceforth risks its inner cohesion at any moment, both because of its smaller effective number and the absence of a positive guiding idea, as well as the inferiority of its determination. The fear of the masses causes a turn towards dictatorship—a theme explored by Spengler in his works.



At the beginning of each civilization, there is typically a constitutional monarchy, of which the most extreme form is the Republic. In the state-state system, the British model could be advantageously copied.

Two inner contradictions have always plagued nineteenth-century parliamentary states: firstly, the genealogical principle that saw strength in the state as an embodiment of a dynasty no longer credible; and secondly, the cold intellect that only recognized the perfect form of government. These contradictions symbolize the opposition between Time, Space, becoming, and being.

While in England parties were distinguished by their possession of different though well-tested modes of government, on the Continent the criterion was whether the Constitution should be changed towards tradition or theory. In this contest, it was forgotten that foreign policy is the ultimate standard of inward fitness. The domestic and diplomatic services developed in opposite directions, with abstract money emerging as the real victor of the dilemma.

This involves the reason for the decay of democracy. The Third Estate attains political effectiveness as a party to which one adheres because of agreement with its conceptual program but does not inwardly belong. Only the bourgeoisie is "in" as a party. The aristocracy, though it may constitute itself defensively, adopts liberal methods merely as a mode of survival.

Marxists, also forced into their bourgeois form and exhibiting continual conflict between their will—which is necessarily outside constitutionalism and defined by Spengler as organic—and its appearance, face the growth of parties that entails eventual degeneration into interest groups. The reason for the cohesiveness of the bourgeoisie disappears with the elimination of the political eminence of the First Estate.

For democracy to work as intended, it requires almost total absence of interested leaders. Yet a tendency that has once embodied itself in political form not only motivates parties but because it is too entrenched to be easily removed. At first, parties come into existence for the sake of the program; then they are held onto defensively to offer power or clean up governance issues.



Finally, the program is forgotten and the organization exists for its own sake. This Spengler calls Caesarism, the culmination of formless power.

Thus, according to Spengler, the rights of the people and their influence must be sharply differentiated. Indeed, the influence of the electorate varies inversely with the degree of universality of the franchise. The people's capacity for denying rights to choose their own representatives is in every fully developed organization it recruits itself. The effective control of political capacities ultimately determines the stability of leadership.

The leaders always seek ways to maintain their power and influence, regardless of the voters' universal rights. Spengler emphasizes that while the electorate has a fundamental role, its actual influence diminishes as organizations become more self-perpetuating.



The emergence of money as a dominating force in democracy's final stage is concerning. Religions require funds, and public opinion must be made amenable through campaigns. In this phase, the free formation of public opinion becomes impossible. The press becomes an independent force, manipulating minds by constant repetition of party slogans. It suppresses hostile or financially ineffective criticism with its "Conspiracy of Silence" and forestalls potential adverse effects of occasional books by reviewing them.

This is linked to the particular dynamism of Faustian man, who, even in Scholasticism, achieved a level of unity that allowed no hostile criticism. This state strives for the dictatorship of party machines supported by the press. Election campaigns become civil wars fought with ballots. The foregone conclusion that forms the theoretical basis of democracy is preserving the form even if it contradicts advantage—a task the non-state finds itself incapable of doing.

Gradually, people grow to believe the Constitution contains ineffective guarantees and rights that their grandparents died for cease to be meaningful to descendants. They become indifferent to these gleaming concepts and turn to the relief afforded by a Second Religiousness. The political form-world has been thought through to completion, and Destiny begins to assert itself.



This text appears to be a reflection on historical political theory, contrasting periods like Caesarism with earlier traditions such as those seen in Napoleon's era. Here’s a revised version with corrected spelling and grammar:

---

Since Marx, Western political theorists have struggled to reach the same depth of influence.

Democracy is not an end but a stage on the road from Napoleonic principles to Cæsarism. The latter encompasses all the traits—bloodlust, dynamic emotion, and a sense of grandeur—that mark the late empire.
