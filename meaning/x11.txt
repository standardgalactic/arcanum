The assertion that religion originated from the countryside, expressing infinite longing and representing the pulse of eternal becoming, contrasts with the Reformation, which is a product of the city—cold, brilliant, sterile, and blissful for young culture. The peace typified by smiling Mary is irrevocably lost. Religious fervor rises once more but now expresses hard intelligence, pedantry, and obstinacy characteristic of Neo-Platonism, Islam, and Puritanism. It clings to its creation, a product of the city's deep inwardness, with a sort of terror lest it prove unreal and is therefore impatient, pitiless, unforgiving.

The lived metaphysics of the early period have in the Independents been replaced by common devotion to concepts, sets, abstract ideas, and critical judgments on faith that are no longer experienced. Life becomes a comprehended mechanism from which all Puritans develop predestination as a technical guarantee for the triumph or election. Another fifty years and rational criticism alone remains supreme.

This leads to the age of Descartes, the world-as-city, the acme of temporarily triumphant waking consciousness. The countryside has long reverted to its biological state. It gazes upon the strange creation of human art with incomprehending hatred. Such is the feeling of Donne towards it all.



The city, which could vanish like morning mist, concentrates all thought and decisions of life within it. The spirit of the city is coldly practical. Philosophy frees itself from its dependence on religion and subjects the entire world, including religion, to epistemological criticism. In this period, life reveals itself as an object rather than a self-evident existence. This stage is symbolized by Pascal's deep spirituality against the shallow utilitarianism of Mill.

Life becomes a problem of achieving maximum happiness. Each culture develops its own mode of spiritual extinction at this stage. The Apollonian soul, with its ideal of pure body and opposition between Entwurf (project) and Entfaltung (unfolding), faces the tragedy of senseless incidents that bind man by the blind threads of destiny. Only through Stoicism—a purging of the soul or whatever is alien to it—can one emerge in their pure estate, akin to embodied spirit.

The Western will-to-power, expressed as a commanding imperative, completes the materialization of its soul.



The mechanical solution to Socialism represents a significant shift in philosophical thought from classical ideals. Great philosophy, as once known, has concluded; since those times, no major thinkers have emerged after the Stoics. Western thought, as articulated by Kant, reached its final form with his work.

All that the 19th century achieved was the mechanization of profound concepts into a utilitarian will-to-life. Previously, deep thinking was associated with metaphysical themes, but it has now become focused on socio-politics. The metaphysics of the Baroque era evolved into the critique of society by Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. There is a dim yearning for a return to nature—not the landscapes of early Gothic art, but Rousseau's conceptual definition of nature and Marx's natural relations.

Kant envisioned the world as appearance or phenomena; however, to Schopenhauer, it was merely a brain phenomenon with utilitarian connotations. The shift from the tragic view to the plebeian perspective—from Goethe's intuitive feeling to Shakespeare's inner necessity, and finally to Marx's frog-perspective—is complete. Poets build but no longer sing, shaping creations not for their own sake but to prove something.

The Darwinian theory of evolution introduced Manchester School theories into concepts of destiny, replacing the inward harmony of Gothic thought with a mechanistic conception of aims called progress, deemed necessary for that period. The deepest thinker of the 19th century, defined by Spengler as one imposing views on behalf of all with attention directed towards Germany—a world neither Goethe nor Kant ever devoted a moment's thought to—was the Socialist.

**Asias and the Saints of Culture**

In the view of Socialists, art has become formless; early religious self-assurance and great style represented a rhythm of self-implementation. However, this well-defined style is becoming less clear as self-consciousness grows.

For Michelangelo, Leonardo, Rembrandt, Bach, and Beethoven, the great style was an aid, allowing artists to pour their innermost thoughts into creation. Schools of art produced high-quality work, freeing artists from struggling with form. However, with Wagner and Pergolesi, style became a hindrance. Everything becomes larger, more esoteric in Western culture, and more ornate in the Apollinian Culture.

Finally, the great style is lost, replaced by an endless stream of new art problems derived from a meaningless creativity. Instead of schools, taste becomes the only criterion.

Natural science began by dissecting the religious worldview, both products of human astonishment at the universe's motion and attempts to dominate its inexorability. The intellect believes it has mastered eternal truths but cannot rest until every question is answered and no riddle remains unresolved.

Yet, since nature is what humans construct from their own experiences, that which we observe exists within the process of observation. Moreover, every scientific result is a consequence of a method, presupposing a belief in its conclusiveness. "Descartes meant to doubt everything but certainly not the value of his doubting."

No Western thinker questions the efficacy of empirical observation, just as no Magian scientist needs to invoke miracles to explain phenomena not amenable to causal analysis. Thus, Western science emerged.
