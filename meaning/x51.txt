The will of God is an omnipotent presence, guiding humanity through various interpretations of divine law as a reaction to man's internal struggles and societal roles. This relationship between the individual and the collective forms the foundation of spiritual development and moral understanding.

Within this dynamic lies the challenge of interpreting religious texts and doctrines in ways that resonate with contemporary experiences. As society evolves, so too do its interpretations of faith, spirituality, and their implications on daily life. 

The internal conflict often arises from trying to reconcile personal beliefs with external societal expectations. This tension can lead individuals to seek a deeper understanding of their place within the broader tapestry of religious and cultural identity.

In essence, the journey towards spiritual maturity involves navigating these complex interactions between divine will, individual conscience, and communal norms. It is through this exploration that one finds meaning and purpose aligned with both personal faith and societal values.



In the context of internal proletariat struggles, the most exclusive God typically triumphs due to his exclusivity, which embodies a will to maintain an unimpaired identity. Yahweh outperformed competitors for the soul of the internal proletariat of the Semitic world, enabling Christianity to develop its approach to the unity of one omnipotent God into a Universal Brotherhood.

On life's plane, Toynbee distinguishes the same incompatibility between behavior and feeling as exhibited on other planes. Here, two pairs—violent and gentle—arise, each containing an antinomy of possible attitudes. Relics men and futurists constitute the violent pair. Archaism is defined as the attempt to return to a happier period that now appears as the Golden Age by remounting the stream of time. It operates in the same fields as promiscuity, Conduct, Art, Language, and Religion.

While promiscuity reveals a spontaneous feeling resulting from the loss of style, archaism represents a conscious effort, strenuously pursued to recreate institutions of a happier time. In politics, the reintroduction of the Roman censorship around 250 BC parallels the veneration accorded to English kingship. Archaism in art expresses itself through styles like neo-Gothic and the adoration by the Renaissance.

Relics men exhibit extreme violence, either aiming to revert humanity to a barbarous state or attempting to annihilate all traces of civilization. They are seen as pathological extremes, with their impulses being atavistic or futuristic. In politics, relics men may seek to restore ancient states like the Roman Empire or revive past institutions such as the Papacy in its medieval form. In art, they might aim to return to early Renaissance styles.

Futurists, by contrast, strive to establish a new civilization by destroying the old one and starting afresh. They also embody an exclusive will to identity but are more prone to destruction. Political futurism often manifests as revolutionary or anarchic movements aiming to eradicate established institutions. In art, futurists may prefer non-objective styles that break completely from traditional forms.



The field of language at our disposal yields interesting results in an attempt to purge all 'dead' languages from history, as noted in Vol. VI, p. 49.

Language does not take into account the complete interdependence of all Indo-European languages and constitutes the confines of a decreased soul. Archaism is doomed to futility; it goes against the unchangeable past. The frustration of this endeavor leads its practitioners to resort to violence, thus heightening their despair. When archaism comes to the full realization of its impotence, an abrupt turn in direction occurs, and the soul plunges into a more deeply meaningful way of puerilism.

Where archaism attempts to remount the stream of Time, purism rushes blindly in the opposite direction, fleeing from an unbearable present. This attitude is even more contrary to human nature and consequently requires a tour de force of a still higher pitch. Futurism reveals itself in the adoption of outlandish dress and manners, such as Kaiser's Attire or Peter the Great’s reforms, which are outstanding examples. Its institutional manners suggest that the organs of social life can be rearranged—Hitler rearranged the German administration; Peter the Great westernized Russia.

Puturism appears rather than it has any right to expect success (Vol. VI, p. 63). This concept is discussed in "Post Conclusions" (Vol. VI, p. 109). These examples seem to prove the success of futurism. However, Byzantine's institutions prevented a transplanted internal prototype from ever returning to its former state.

When faced with physical revolt by the dominant minority’s oppression, it sees an apocalyptic vision before one’s eyes—a change less than an inversion of the present order, a role reversal between slaves and masters. This was the Jewish reaction to Roman and Persian occupations, conjuring up a Messiah who would transform agony into bliss through the establishment of an Israeli Commonwealth. The mundane world remains the center of hope. It took the catastrophic defeats of the Maccabees to teach Judaism the lesson of deeper spiritual resilience—the recognition that the Three Kingdoms of God do not lie in this world. This instruction is transfiguration, the appearance of a supra-mundane plane of reality.

The practitioners of archaism and futurism appear on the scene as saviors with a time-machine. They arise in all cases of disintegrating society. The external proletariat develops its savior-archaists who seek to return to a happy civilization impacted, while the dominant minority also produces savior-futurists acting in the field of foreign relations whose policy can lead to fiascos, such as Justinian’s attempt to revive the Western Roman Empire.

When they attempt to remedy this by looking forward instead of backward, it often leads them into new realms of complexity and challenges.



The social conditions they endure are described by their own case for the internal proletariat's loss as the dominant minority's gain. These outlaw saviors often include some of the nobility's souls, who themselves are part of the dominating minority. They find joy under their influence.

A displacement from the Internal Proletariat's futuristic hopes is clarified by these outlaw saviors. The City of Destruction is transcended, and the City of God is brought into view.

Archaisms and Futurism reveal a pair of violent responses to the gentle pains of existence. Just as the impracticality of futurism leads to self-transcendence, so too does the frustration of archaism lead to detachment. The sorrow of a disintegrating society finds bliss in a willful resignation for salvation that exists only through detachment and withdrawal from it all.

These themes are explored in Toynbee's study on disintegration and his examination of human history and civilization.
