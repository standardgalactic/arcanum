Similarly, Athens became a center of education for Hellenic culture in the 5th and 6th centuries. However, this magnificent success blinded Athens to new problems. The inadequacy of the polis (city-state) organization as a stable base for further Hellenic growth was the most pressing challenge of the 4th-century Hellenic civilization. Athens could only react by attempting to assert military hegemony, but its reliance on physical strength was quickly reached. Eventually, peripheral powers like Macedonia and Rome, whose prospects had initially seemed less bright than those of Athens, transcended the polis. Moreover, the glory of their philosophy evoked such idolization that the divine truth reached by Paul fell on deaf ears in Athens.

Enormities resulted from the idolization of an ephemeral institution exhibited by the military states of the Greek city-states. Constant warfare led to the breakdown of Hellenic civilization. This illustrates Toynbee's confusion of normative and empirical elements, as discussed in his post-conclusions. Even after disintegration had run its course and barbarians occupied Rome, Justinian attempted to invoke the spirit of the Roman Empire for Belisarius' campaign in Italy. This futile effort so depleted the resources of Anatolia that it weakened the empire's stability.

Toynbee, Vol. IV, pp. 26-273.



The Sanas Bid Empire succeeded in annexing most of Byzantium but caused the breakdown of that civilization, similarly to how the Parliament of Westminster is performing functions for which it is organizationally unsuited. The representation of territorial units is the most effective democratic device in an agricultural society. However, the complexities of industrialism require a Parliament based on corporate rather than territorial structures. Yet, the worship of this ephemeral institution will likely prevent England from finding a solution to this 20th-century challenge.

The arrested advancement of any society to the final name of idolatry is seen in the idolization of ephemeral techniques. Like their biological counterparts in an organism whose overly adaptation to an environment has led to their stagnation on the evolutionary scale, initial technological advantages are often purchased at the cost of flexibility, exemplified by the gradual decline of Britain's commercial position. The excessive reliance on a military technique leads to that sudden collapse of apparent coalescence, as David encountered with Goliath.

Toynbee accounts for three types of idolatry: the idolization of an ephemeral self, an ephemeral institution, and an ephemeral technique—all manifestations of the passive form of the nemesis of idolatry. This exhibits the sin of resting on one's own arms. The active nemeses, however, are not detailed here but would involve the challenges that correct these imbalances.



Toynbee identifies several forms of military ambition that arise from a psychological condition characterized by being spoiled by success. This leads to a loss of mental and moral balance, resulting in an impulsive drive to achieve the impossible. Here, Toynbee distinguishes these forms:

1. **Arrogance in Success**: A form of militarism arises from arrogance due to success without appreciating its limits or recognizing one's physical strength.

2. **Fear of Global Domination**: The fear that a militant state will inevitably exterminate other populations if it decides to end the constant state of insecurity, as happened with Assyria. Despite escaping immediate nemesis through an ephemeral technique, Assyria's recurrent use of force against coalitions or neighboring societies led to its downfall.

3. **Destructive Careers**: The careers of figures like Charlemagne and Timur Lenk reveal the self-destructive nature of military imperialism when positioned as guardians of civilization. Successes placed great opportunities within their grasp, with border provinces acting as an impetus for expansion into barbarian territories.



From a vastly different perspective, the civilization's geographical articulation was expanded. This expansion exhibited an aspect of the process of etherealization. By assuming the task of military defense, they liberated their energies for other endeavors and continued creative tasks within the civilization.

Timur Lenk and Charlemagne failed to perform their proper functions. They diverted their energies into strengthening their own civilizations, leading to a civil war—the only issue that could result in social breakdown. The Iranian civilization did not succumb long after Timur's onslaught due to the weakness of Western Europe, which was saved by the fresh challenge presented by the Normans.

The intoxication of victory constitutes a special instance of what Toynbee calls the "active" nemesis of creativity in his schema for both secular and spiritual history. The Victory over Hannibal so slackened Roman military discipline that the next century saw a series of defeats at the hands of other advancing powers. In the spiritual realm, Gregory brought the Church out of the depth of disrepute into which it had fallen in previous generations. However, the initial successes against the alliance with the Sicilian Normans sanctioned a use of force that inextricably involved the church in worldly affairs.



The conflict with the Hohenstaufen symbolized an idolization that often accompanies great power, suggesting that every empire contains its own nemesis. Innocent III's seemingly preemptive actions masked an inner weakness, which became evident during the Babylonian captivity before the end of the century.

The nature of creativity harbors two possible aberrations: the passive sin of resting on one’s laurels and the active idolatry of achievements. This is encapsulated in the saying that those who live by the sword shall perish by it. The inevitable penalty for these failures often results in death.

Toynbee's concept of the breakdown of civilizations emerges as a necessary product of his metaphysical response to recurrent challenges. If growth ceases, Toynbee suggests, then decline is inevitable.



**Vol. IV - Aberra, p. 506**

This passage provides a better illustration of the penalty for falling into self-deterioration due to a decadent purpose than of an inexplicable decline by mechanical necessity. The intractability of mechanisms and institutions limits our ability to evaluate social breakdown.

No aspect of Toynbee's philosophy can escape its inherent assumptions. Asserting that civilizations break down as a result of some failure of will-power on the part of their members does not refute the organic necessity inherent in societal structures. Individuals constitute the entities of action, but the key problem lies in distinguishing human valuation as the cause or consequence of decline.
