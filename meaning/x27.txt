In summary, understanding motivation requires moving beyond simplistic associations with pleasure and considering broader cultural and existential influences.



The question at hand is the relationship between action, intent, and historical tendency. On one side, actions embody the logic of history and are necessary; on the other, there's an attempt to reconcile this with determinism.

All actions appear determined in retrospect if they result from free will or intention. The intent and the tendency of a historical figure can be different. As Spengler frequently points out, while the totality of events is not totally coincidental within intention and yet dependent on it, the greater the interval between the event and analysis, the more determined the action appears. With time passing, all possible outcomes accompanying performance are forgotten, leaving only the act as a testament to its irrevocability.

Hume's perspective suggests that one can never imagine anything totally outside of their frame of reference or detailed historical development that ensued if, for example, Archduke Franz Ferdinand had not interfered in Sarajevo. This is beyond the scope even of the most profound research into his lineage.

The frustrated soul of a suddenly traditionalist Germany in the 1920s cried out for something to hold onto. Despite this and evidence abundantly proving otherwise, none of Hitler's lieutenants unleashed the destructive forces that were eventually produced by the Führer. Hitler's fate hung on several occasions where some little incident saved him from disaster. In the minds of the chief actors here existed countless alternatives. Whatever our view of the necessity of these events today, the key question is how far necessity could have predicted or guided action in 1933.

Similarly, Spengler’s analysis of British development contains many challenging observations. However, he has not explained why it was the Fronde and not the state that demonstrated tests in the seventeenth century.



The tension between historical necessity and individual freedom is a compelling aspect of human experience. Even though necessity seems essential as a guide to action, it often appears paradoxical in the realm of freedom. Typically, life presents alternatives, offering choices that seem indispensable; without these alternatives, life would be unimaginable.

This perhaps represents the deepest meaning of Immanuel Kant's union of the categorical imperative with historical necessity. Necessity itself is useless as a guide for action even from a pragmatist perspective. Historical figures often died believing they had failed, yet represented their culture’s future; conversely, others reached temporary success, only to find their positions historically hollow.

The question of conceptual historical necessity can be left unresolved since it's prejudged by our experience of freedom. Freedom is not merely a quantitative measure but an inner experience of life as a process of deciding meaning through alternatives. This does not imply unlimited choice; individuals are products of their age, nation, and environment. However, they also embody what is essentially unapproachable by analysis: the form of history's moral personality. 

No matter how we retrospectively explain action, its accomplishment occurred with an internal conviction that transcends mere rationalization. This inner experience underscores the creative essence of history.

To assert life inherently involves decay is a view, like that of Oswald Spengler regarding cultural development from youth to decline, which lacks merit. No culture has yet been permanent; striving for such permanence is futile. Cleaned of its original inconsistencies and unnecessary annotations, this perspective emphasizes the complexity and unpredictability inherent in human history and moral experience.



The fulfillment of a task is not even to man's choosing, nor can he entirely escape the conditions of his time. However, the particular period taken by each generation has its meaning for them. Man finds purpose for his actions within himself and not in discovering purposes in phenomena. This responsibility was correctly seen by Kant as a duty since even inactivity posits an absolute norm.

We come to the final problem in Spengler concerning Youth and Age: Can one attribute or assign periods to cultures? How valid is the analogy to organic entities? The problem of age is not solely tied to a physiological state. After a certain period in life, knowledge becomes more definite, with the inexorability of development in light of one's past inevitable. Knowledge of tradition brings consistency in action and gives rise to the desire that must live out an essentially meaningless belief, only to provide content to his past.

This is evident in the drama of Rubashov in "Darkness at Noon" and Ivan Karamazov of "The Brothers Karamazov," who confess not because he committed murder but because the crime was implicit in his previous life, which could acquire meaning through age. Yet age is not exclusively a physiological state. Life brings an eternal recurrence of problems; settling each conditions and weakens the ability to respond to others. This dilemma cannot be resolved much further by abstract argument. The physiological analogy is not tenable when considering cultures as living organisms.



The existence or development of civilizations can be conceived as a succession of dilemmas. Toynbee correctly analyzed the challenge and response element, but he turned it into a mechanistic method for material salvation. It appears that the solution to each problem gradually erodes some part of its inner meaning.

In doing so, the intensity of responsibility diminishes progressively, rendering the experience less meaningful and threatening to the permanence of response. The League of Nations was a dream; the United Nations is merely a temporary continuation of its idea—a long-lasting but fragile attempt to sustain it.



Perhaps dispelled is the myth that ageing in a culture may well be the gradual solution to problems inherent in its existence, with death as a form of disenchantment. An abstract argument can give no aid because the fact of existence for cultures poses a potent threat towards those who live life and because regardless of their very state, they maintain an eternal quality.
