In the 11th century, warfare had broken down in the Byzantine Empire's realm. The internecine conflicts of preceding centuries had not transitioned to the peace associated with a universal state. In these circumstances, the Ottoman Empire represented relief from oppressive situations. According to Toynbee, this situation parallels Asia (including all of Japan and India), which achieved a universal state under Western inspiration.

A society can be absorbed into an alien civilization in two primary ways: through apparent assimilation-and-affiliation or genuine integration. The more painful process—defeat—leads to victory for the inner meaning of a culture, often salvaged by a universal power. Total absorption results in the atrophy of all cultural activity; it is broken down and does not cause its demise.

If the breakdown of civilizations does not result from losing command over either the physical or human environment, what accounts for the high incidence of fatalities among civilizations? Toynbee finds part of the answer in the faculty of mimesis. This social drill, which arises from humanity's inability to absorb directly the inspiration of the Saints, is fraught with dangers. Just as increased technological efficiency increases an engineer's responsibility, so too does the facility of mimesis become dangerous if directed along the path charted by a creative minority. Mimesis is rationalized through its mechanical nature; tradition provides the best guarantee for the safe direction of mimesis.

When individuals break away from traditional customs, they are forced to live dangerously, under constant threat of breakdown. Their dependence on mimetic influences exposes them to dangers that can affect their creativity. Leaders may become infected with the hubris they deliberately instilled in their followers, transforming purposeful advancement into robotic activity. The loss of creativeness destroys their claim to leadership; the magical charm evaporates and the multitude, previously inspired as part of a social tie, loses its way. The exercise of force constitutes an abuse of trust which eventually harms its perpetrators. The future of the Promethean element leads to a loss of harmony. Society splits into classes and dissipates its strength in inner conflict.

The intratability of institutions provides another obstacle to the uniform growth of civilizations.



The best adapted methods yield maximum results, as reflected in Christ's saying that a new wine should not be placed in old bottles. This concept can be successfully applied only to an individual. However, society serves as the common ground for many individuals' fields of action and severely limits the range of possible adaptations.

Social readjustments have to contend with the force of inertia, which always attempts to keep structures static. Creative forces can overcome these tendencies through radical adjustments, utilizing old institutions for new purposes, or by violently altering their stasis. Violent removal, or revolution, is a process of retarded millenials: the violence necessary to overcome what is anachronistic. The intensity required is proportional to the anachronism that must be overcome.

Social enormities utilize old institutions for purposes never meant to fit them. If these responses accomplish their own adjustments, growth is assured. Evolution may assist growth by removing impediments to progress; however, the resort to force always constitutes a moral blight.

Enormities are the very embodiments of social breakdown. However, their perversion of institutions results in that rigid state of outlook which characterizes arrested and declining civilizations.

Toynbee attributes much of the inconsistency of human fortunes and the recurrent growth and decline of civilizations to the nemesis of creativity. Creative responses to successive challenges are extremely rare. Indeed, it seems that such capacity is what distinguishes successful from unsuccessful adaptations.



It seemed that a necessary solution had been proposed, but it failed. This led to further challenges as they faced an impasse. The problem at hand required thoughtful insight into the situation.

The complexity lay in understanding the limitations and ensuring righteousness prevailed without bias. It was crucial for them to consider all aspects carefully and act wisely. In times of need, the community often turned to wise counsel, much like those who sought guidance from Jewish teachings, which offered profound insights into creating equitable solutions that aligned with ethical values.

Ultimately, it was about finding a path forward through mutual understanding and respect, striving towards resolving the challenges they faced together.



This is the motif of the ancient drama, as described by Goldschmidt, which occurs after Horatio's narration of the ghost story in Shakespeare's play. It traces the journey from the human sin of envy to transcendence through purification and moral enlightenment.

The promise of a supra-mundane kingdom offered by Christ is echoed in this narrative arc. The protagonist ascends to higher truths and moral clarity, transcending base emotions like envy that plague humanity. This transformation aligns with classical notions of purification and redemption found in both ancient drama and Christian teachings.

In the process, there's an emphasis on the triumph over human flaws through spiritual growth and ethical conduct. It highlights a universal theme: the potential for personal evolution and enlightenment beyond worldly concerns.

In the legend of Croesus's end, a deepening understanding emerges. In Aeschylus, the total collapse of all human aspirations does not result from the aberration of a fickle deity but from a deficiency in the soul. Sin, not Envy, dooms human endeavor. The sinner’s downfall follows an inner alienation from divine love, making them unworthy to continue as God's inhabitant.

The nemesis or destruction constitutes one aspect of man's doom with God playing only a passive role, revealing the inevitable consequence of conduct. This aberration accomplishes itself in two possible modes: passive fault comes from standing still on one’s own and committing instead of stepping stone; worshipping time instead of eternity. The adoration of a storied past tends to induce passivity towards taking action.

The exaltation of the creature in place of the Creator characterizes arrested civilizations. This idol—the replacement of the constantly true by the ephemeral—exemplifies active aberration, which denies limits and rushes headlong into disaster through a psychological condition of being spoiled by success until annihilation becomes a consequence.

Toynbee distinguishes several forms of idolatry. The idolization of an ephemeral self led them to disintegrate. After having divined a truth of eternal validity in the sublimity of one True God, Israel fell into the error of conceiving its terrestrial spiritual eminence as an eternal divine sanction. Worshiping past greatness that had been bequeathed by the self-adoration of the "Chosen People" made it unable to accept the greater treasure offered by Christianity. Thus, Israel prospered while Christianity was preached by Galileans.
