The theory posits that civilizations go through phases of development, with each phase contributing to a cumulative understanding of history rather than representing a singular pinnacle of achievement. This perspective challenges the Eurocentric assumption prevalent during the 19th century, which equated a civilization's influence at its peak with the total meaning of its history. It reflects an attitude that views one's own cultural standpoint as normative, similar to how pre-Copernican science saw Earth as the center of the universe.

Moreover, the idea of integrating the world into a Western pattern is limited mainly to economic aspects and does not encompass political plans. The contributions from other civilizations—such as Syriac influences on Western thought, the foundations of Chinese philosophy, and the advanced state of Sumerian astronomy—highlight that no single civilization should be considered ultimate or superior.

In essence, acknowledging these diverse contributions underscores a more inclusive understanding of global development, free from biases toward any one cultural narrative.



Before delving into the history of civilization, it is important to understand that its division into medieval and modern periods does not reveal stages of uninterrupted progress but rather a common effort. The success of this endeavor can be judged only by the attainment of a new level of integration.

All civilizations are philosophically contemporary. Compared to the age of the Earth, the difference in age between civilizations becomes negligible; the youth of species is apparent in terms of its overall timeline.

Civilizations represent intelligible fields within the body and mind of a species in an evolutionary process. Their relation in time constitutes an aspect of deepening religious ideas but does not result in successive stages of uniform advancement. They are philosophically equivalent, functionally contemporary, and allow comparison to determine the laws governing historical processes.

The uncertainty about the outcome of the evolutionary process prevents any evaluation of the intrinsic merit of civilizations. This is compounded by the insignificance of any achievement compared to the common goal. Toynbee utilizes the analogy of a one-way street to illustrate the philosophical equivalence of civilizations. The direction of the course creates dynamic activity and prevents reversals or even stopping the vehicle. Nevertheless, none of the twenty-one civilizations that have entered this thoroughfare has succeeded in passing beyond its exit. Fourteen have reversed, violating the rule, and seven exhibit various stages of breakdown.

The further points of penetration lie so close together that an evaluation, either absolutely or in terms of distance from the exit, becomes a philosophical impossibility. 

Thus, civilizations represent intelligible fields within the body and mind of a species in an evolutionary process. Their relation in time constitutes an aspect of deepening religious ideas but does not result in successive stages of uniform advancement. They are philosophically equivalent, functionally contemporary, and allow comparison to determine the laws governing historical processes.

If civilizations represent geniuses of a new species, they offer insights into the dictation of progress.



Toynbee is aware of the goal and presents another inconsistency in his empirical scheme. He endeavors to locate a principle that distinguishes primitive societies from civilizations to find a clue for solving this problem. He rejects the view that the possession of institutions, or the articulation of the division of labor, can serve as a criterion, noting these occur in very elaborate forms across all types of historical existence. Toynbee finds the distinguishing feature in "mimesis," a generic aspect of social life defined by the acquisition through imitation of acts which the actor observes and performs.

What accounts for their genius? Toynbee seeks to locate a principle that distinguishes primitive societies from civilizations in order to find a clue for the solution of this problem. He rejects the view that possession of institutions or the articulation of the division of labor can serve as criteria, since these occur in very elaborate forms across all types of historical existence. Instead, Toynbee finds the distinguishing feature in "mimesis," defined by the acquisition through imitation of acts observed and performed.



The question is whether societies have original elements that they would not possess if they hadn't encountered and imitated others who already had them. Mimesis, as a social process, involves imitation and adaptation, leading to the acquisition of new traits by different societies. This raises the question of whether the difference between civilizations and primitive societies is fundamental or transient.

Arnold J. Toynbee's metaphysical assumption of cyclical progress provides a framework for this discussion. According to Toynbee, all existence not only involves growth but also demonstrates an evolutionary pattern of survival. Civilizations represent merely the most recent stage in the transformation process from primitive to advanced societies.



What must have occurred to necessitate having a technological being, such as Toynbee's "superman," in a socio-cultural environment? In biological terms, this involves evolutionary processes where complex organisms adapt and evolve within specific environments. In this context, the emergence of technological beings could be seen as an extension or transformation of human capabilities through advanced technology. This adaptation might reflect changes in social structures, cultural norms, and environmental conditions that drive the need for such entities to exist and thrive.



The idea that primitive societies were static or stagnant is misleading; they exhibit dynamic creativity that surpasses many achievements of more recent civilizations. The current condition of these societies is not one of uninspired torpor but rather a state of integration.

Toynbee likens humanity's task to climbing a vast mountain with multiple ledges. Climbing steep sides requires great exertion, sometimes providing the strength needed to reach the next ledge, though often resulting in failure and descent. This perspective limits human vision to only one perpendicular and one horizontal surface. The exhausted figure on a ledge is frequently mistaken for paralysis by those below, but reflection reveals that reaching these ledges required prodigious effort, with many ledges lower down likely containing the remains of past adventurers.

The difference between primitive societies and civilizations lies not in their foundational nature or permanence but in the act and place of observation. The present state of primitive societies reminds us only of past motion, just as the activity of future civilizations will appear when humanity has evolved into what Toynbee calls "Superman." His biological approach suggests history is a non-evolutionary process characterized by cycles of integration and differentiation.

The genesis of civilizations indicates a shift from static conditions to creative effort. This holds true even in systems of appropriation and affiliation, where dominant minorities are inherently static. The succession of the internal proletariat reveals dynamic reaction that transforms torpor into activity and integration into new differentiation. Thus, the births of civilizations mark specific beats within a generational rhythm—a universal pulse.
