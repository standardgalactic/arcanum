The confusion between ethics and nature is complete. It makes little difference whether morality claims the sanction of reason or vice versa; in this schema, both are reduced to parallel appearances of the same inexorability. The aspirations of humanity represent a mode of nature's mechanism. 

Kant’s moral philosophy derives its sublimity from his intuition that ethics depend on a direct relation to the infinite and a transcendental experience that sets apart autonomous rational beings. This distinction between noumena (things-in-themselves) and phenomena represents the resolve of a soul wanting to escape the determined inevitability of the physical world, and impart its own purposefulness upon the causal unfolding of events.

The postulates of God, freedom, and immortality testify to a vision that has experienced numinal reality and recognizes no obstacles in the empirical world. The nine articles of the essay on "Eternal Peace" reveal the pervasive nature of this moral experience and its determining effect on all political human affairs. 

The true meaning of existence was seen to emerge from the content ascribed to the categorical imperative, from a feeling of responsibility towards humankind, and from the duty to create peace out of discord and recognition.

From the empirical world, what lessons can be derived from the Origin of Pure Reason? Knowledge had to be limited, but that limitation must be overcome. The categorical imperative universalizes a personal relation to the ultimate reality underlying all phenomena. However, this implies that the noumena are approachable only through a direct experience of the moral law.

The mode of their operation in phenomena cannot be decided by pure reason nor really affirmed by teleological judgment. The transcendental intuition of freedom does not necessarily reveal the objective mode of numinal operation but only its relation to man. It lifts man above himself and attaches him to a higher world order through vision—a timeless, incommunicable, and certainly unclassifiable teleological experience.

The categorical imperative represents a meaningful principle when it leads into action. If Kant were basing his ideas for a Universal History and the achievement of Eternal Peace on the categorical imperative, he would present a different situation. He could then assert that the command for peace is an emanation of transcendental experience, which in its very concept contains its possibility. The implementation of moral maxims would then be conceivable as inherently aligned with their purpose.



The conclusion concerning the will's role in achieving a conceptual understanding of moral law is not merely technical but foundational for the articles on Eternal Peace. This framework posits that our obligation to peace stems from principles revealed by the moral law, which guides humanity’s pursuit of historical fulfillment and identifies peace as its noblest task. Achieving this involves institutionalizing the categorical imperative within a republican constitution.

The Idea for a Universal History sanctions its political measures through an inexorable development rather than relying solely on the will determined by the moral law or technical evaluations. This vision arises from a revolt against the dark uncertainties of constant warfare, suggesting that discord may lead to harmony only through proper analysis and not mere duty-based determination.

For instance, the distinction between theory and practice in moral questions is crucial. The value of any given practice depends on its alignment with an appropriate theory, emphasizing the importance of theoretical principles over practical conditions for executing laws.

Furthermore, morality arises from analysis rather than categorical imperatives supplying norms to approximate moral content. This becomes evident in Kant's "Perpetual Peace," where he formulates a hypothetical technical question about balancing selfish tendencies for achieving peace—not through moral perfection but through understanding nature’s mechanism to compel societies towards compulsory laws and thus establish peace.



In short, we can say that nature is irresistible, and laws achieve superior force by aligning with natural forces. If one neglects this, it will be accomplished only through much inconvenience.

The transcendent experience of morality has disappeared as a guide to action. A mechanism replaces the categorical imperative as a motivating force. 

Freedom, according to Immanuel Kant in "Perpetual Peace," seems at odds with his criticism of mechanical solutions in the Appendix. However, the correspondence of this view with the Idea for a Universal History makes it important to consider.

Volition operates as a tool within this framework and can be manipulated or guided on a course but does not inherently determine outcomes according to Kant.



The distinction between teleology in nature is more apparent than real. The tentativeness of a hypothesis applies only to its conclusions, not to the possibility or solving of the problem itself. Its very existence testifies to a belief in the efficacy of its endeavor. Kant's hypothetical approach to natural purpose does not detract from his argument that assuming any purpose is neither unnecessary nor impossible if his original analysis is valid.

If the categorical imperative derives from a transcendental experience of freedom that lifts humanity above the determined necessity of nature, then the mechanical course of nature has no bearing on its applicability. If the necessary unfolding of will through this experience of freedom becomes meaningless, then the categorical imperative would be merely a technical problem with no real ethical significance.

A compromise between these two positions is possible: either ethical subjectivity can derive meaning from an apprehension of its principle, or it is reduced to a function of nature’s mechanism. A contemporary understanding of the regularity of phenomena may yield an intuition of design as the very condition of appearances but does not grant the existence of a higher world-order in which one participates through freedom without at that time determining its conditions.

To resolve these difficulties, one might infer that the physical world contains limiting conditions to the universal applicability of the categorical imperative. This inference stems from Kant’s statement in the Metaphysics of Morals: “We have a duty to act according to the idea of such an end which reason commands (namely peace), even if there is not the least probability that it can be achieved, provided its impossibility cannot be demonstrated.” Friedrich considers this qualifying clause fundamental to his moral philosophy as an important connecting link between the realm of freedom and reality. No one was more aware than Kant of testing hypothetical judgments by experience. His work "Perpetual Peace" illustrates this, where he insisted only what is possible can be morally required.

This solution is not casually satisfactory; its validity depends on what Kant meant by a proof for impossibility. In peace-making, as in other human affairs, we learn that the possibility of achieving certain ends cannot always be known with certainty but should never be dismissed if their achievement does not contradict established moral principles.



Kant's notion of morality does not depend on their attainability in the empirical realm. In fact, Kant denies this. He did not insist on proving the feasibility of the moral law. To do so would make the empirical world the determining principle for the categorical imperative. On the contrary, he affirmed the obligation of a categorical imperative even if there is no slightest probability of its being achieved.
