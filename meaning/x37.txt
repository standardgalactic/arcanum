Growth represents one aspect of the processes of evolution, achieved through ever greater self-articulation and progressive mastery over the environment. Yet what criteria exist for evaluating the growth of a civilization? Does material control over the environment mean the external relations of civilizations or its inner self-determination?

Increased control over an environment expressed in terms of geographical expansion is rejected as a criterion of growth. Expansion seems to exert effects on the ability to respond creatively. The era of Christian unity exists in Catholicism and the Coptic Church of Abyssinia, the Fundamentalism of the Mississippi basin. "The law" that geographical expansion slows social progress further explains the philological phenomenon that the most archaic forms of language usually occur at the farthest distance from their origin.

Why should the period of peak performance be followed by a period of decline? Toynbee argues that "social radiation" obeys the same laws as light-waves. During the period of growth, a civilization emits its influence in a ray of uniform consistency, merging with the broader world culture and economic systems. As time progresses, this influence begins to wane, leading eventually into a phase of decline.



The appearance of new witnesses often results in the diffraction of rays into their component parts through absorption or desired emission. Since the resistance to accepting an alien cultural pattern is much greater than reluctance towards adopting alien techniques, a decaying civilization usually succeeds in influencing economic and sometimes political spheres, but rarely the cultural plane.

Increasing command over the physical environment cannot serve as a criterion for growth: For Toynbee, it represents merely another manifestation of the ego-centric delusion. In the stage of Western civilization, the conception of history as a uniform development of increasing technical mastery precisely reflects the prejudice of the age and is not objectively valid. This view contradicts the doctrine considered here.

Moreover, dividing history into periods distinguished by technological labels—such as Bronze Age, Iron Age, etc.—lacks standing in empirical data. At every stage, new technology was initially the property of a select few and acquired by the rest of mankind through imitation over a gradual process. Thus, there probably never existed a purely Paleolithic age. Additionally, no support from history exists for a necessary connection between technical proficiency and a civilization's growth. The transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic age witnessed an improvement in technique accompanied by degeneration in wisdom, ideas, and style.

The interregnum between the collapse of one apparent order and the appearance of another affiliated civilization also exhibits these trends.



Efficiency in inward trade was a superior technique, as demonstrated by Rome. The improvement in agricultural techniques made large-scale agriculture profitable and led to the introduction of plantation slavery in the Hellenic world. This resulted in the destruction of the traditional peasantry and the consequential rise of a parallel proletariat in Rome, which served as an incubus that eventually entangled the Hellenistic civilization. Finally, technological improvements in military weapons were relatively constant.

Although this argument might imply efficiency from diverse sources, it can hardly be utilized to disprove the theory of uniform progress. The technologies discussed provide only a partial picture concerning the condition of civilization's origin and subsequent development. However, they suggest that certain processes proceeded in inverse ratio to the civilization's growth. Increasing control over the environment does not necessarily correlate with linear progression.

The argument for technological advancement is generally accepted, yet it offers limited insight into broader civilizational dynamics.



Toynbee asserts that a primary criterion for technological progress is not only its immediate benefits but also how it addresses real societal needs. He suggests that true advancement should involve continuous, constructive criticism to ensure technology fosters sustainable growth rather than merely short-term gains.

According to Toynbee, while technological innovation can drive economic and social progress, there must be a concerted effort to manage this growth responsibly. This involves minimizing potential harms and ensuring that advancements align with long-term societal well-being. For true progress, technological development should be accompanied by an understanding of its ecological impact and its role in enhancing the quality of life for all individuals.

Toynbee's perspective implies that the value of technology lies not just in its capabilities but also in how it is integrated into society to promote holistic growth. This requires a balanced approach where innovation is continuously evaluated against ethical, environmental, and social standards to foster genuine advancement.



The idea that evolution follows a pattern of simplification can be observed in various developments across history and science. For instance, writing systems have evolved from complex pictograms, like those used by the Chinese, to Egyptian hieroglyphics, eventually culminating in the alphabet. This invention introduced auxiliary words, enabling Western languages to achieve simplicity while maintaining expressive power comparable to the Arabic verb's many aspects.

Similarly, the progressive simplification of scientific theories parallels this trend. Copernicus replaced Ptolemy’s model with a simpler one that accounted for the same range of phenomena. Later, Einstein provided theories unifying the laws of gravity, radiation, and magnetism. This process of simplification doesn't imply negation or omission but rather the liberation of energy for higher tasks.

Human representations include Socrates, who transferred his attention to the psychic sphere through inner experience in Platonic dialogue, and Gandhi, whose advocacy for handwork symbolized a spiritual plane. In its deepest sense, the process of etherealization exhibits a shift from macrocosm to microcosm activities. Toynbee's criterion of growth applies to this progressive internalization where challenge-and-response dynamics occur within an evolving civilization. This growing civilization eventually becomes its own environment, and subsequent order takes place within itself.

In Hellenic history, the earliest challenges were posed by external environments like the Achaemenids and Cretans. Over time, as civilizations matured, they began addressing challenges from within their internal structures.



The decline of Carthage and the subsequent conquest by European barbarians marked a significant shift, reducing the importance of external factors as conflicts moved to internal fields. In the West, the challenge posed by the Norsemen was addressed through systematic organization rather than direct confrontation. A recent stage in Western history exhibits Bolshevism as the ultimate expression of its absorptive power.

Phaedo Toynbee's assertion that overpopulation—an internal factor—was an early challenge contrasts with this view.

Capital transfer from Russia to Moscow symbolically repudiated the West, forcing it into a pattern aligned with Western civilizations through advancements in technique and electrification. The challenge of Communism, similar to Gandhi who drew inspiration for economic self-sufficiency from rural India, represents an internal problem of Western civilization.
