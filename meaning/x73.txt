Kant's nine principles are:

1. All natural aptitudes of a creature are destined to unfold themselves completely and purposefully.

2. As for man (the only rational creature on earth), these natural aptitudes directed toward the use of his reason will develop fully in the species but not in the individual.

3. Nature has willed that man should develop completely by himself everything beyond the mechanical ordering of his animal existence, and he should not partake of any happiness or perfection except such as he has secured by and for himself through his own reason, independent of instinct.

4. The means which nature employs to produce the development of all mankind’s aptitudes is antagonism in society; this antagonism eventually becomes the cause of a lawful order or society.

5. The greatest problem for the species man that nature forces upon him is the establishment of a civil society which generally administers the law.

6. This problem is mankind's most difficult and will be the last solved by the species.

7. The problem of establishing a perfect civil constitution is dependent upon a lawful external relation between states and cannot be solved without it.

8. It is possible to look upon the history of the human species in the large as the execution of a hidden plan of nature to bring about a constitution which is perfect internally, and for this purpose also externally—because this is the only state in which nature can develop all aptitudes of mankind fully.

9. A philosophical attempt to treat general world history according to a plan of nature aiming at the perfect civil association of the human species must be considered possible and itself promoting this purpose of nature. Man's faculties are not attained in a single life; consequently, they develop completely in the species but not in the individual. However, existence involves strife, and life presents a continuous series of problems. Hardship seems to be the lot of humanity.

Moral duties on men, in order to force him to create his well-being solely by his own work, imply that man's real happiness consists in rational self-esteem. Now, the eternal violence of this struggle gains new meaning. Man’s faculties develop through the antagonism or society and the struggle between nations. The pressure of competition and the insecurity of the state of nature lead to the formation of civil society, whose invocation of the principle of law testifies to an apprehension (though not immediate attainment) of moral ideals. Man's quarrelsome instincts reveal nature’s mechanism for the optimum development of his skills. "Man wants concord, but nature knows better what is good for him; and so from then on she lets it be."



Understanding human insecurity in terms of the monopoly of force is central to addressing humanity's core political problem. The tendency for individuals or groups to exploit situations in their own favor constantly fights against the assertion of the supremacy of law. Law, as a societal construct, derives its power from being a product and reflection of communal values.

It is imperative that we uphold the rule of law over personal gain. Legal frameworks serve not only as instruments of justice but also as mechanisms for ensuring stability and fairness within society. By emphasizing adherence to legal principles, we can mitigate conflicts and enhance collective security.

To achieve this balance, it is essential to foster a culture where laws are respected and enforced impartially. This involves educating individuals about their rights and responsibilities under the law, promoting transparency in governance, and ensuring accountability for those who violate legal norms. Through these efforts, society can move towards a more secure and equitable environment, minimizing exploitation and enhancing trust in legal institutions.



One of justice's primary goals is to determine the proper allocation of wealth, but this can only be achieved after many disappointing failures. Such a goal is considered the ultimate purpose of history.

The perfect civic constitution presupposes lawful relations among states. It is futile to work for domestic peace if war constantly threatens from across borders. The preparations for conflict, the insecurity engendered by armies, and the ravages of never-ending strife create suffering that reason alone would have indicated without such hardship.

Just as the experiences of social life and nature taught individuals the need for rules and regulations among themselves, they reveal the necessity of a mechanism for achieving peace within nations. The eventual creation of a just civic constitution, which will forever banish war and begin an era of harmony among mankind, constitutes one of man's paramount aspirations.



The posed hypothesis is that biases are often rooted in historical contexts. This history informs present assumptions and events, which can perpetuate systemic issues if not critically examined. To address these challenges effectively, it requires a multifaceted approach involving awareness, education, and proactive measures to counteract the influence of past prejudices on current societal structures. Only through recognizing the origins of bias and working collectively towards change can progress be achieved.



Schweitzer's criticism is validated by Kant’s "Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Aim." According to Kant, achieving a universal history is a task for future generations.

Kant’s categorical imperative aligns identically with the design of nature. When history is regarded as phenomena, it reveals an immanence where the transcendental experience of freedom is postulated.
